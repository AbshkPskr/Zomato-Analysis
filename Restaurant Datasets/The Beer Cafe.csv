,The Beer Cafe
0,"They are worse with their services, not even looked interested while serving you or taking the orders. Food is overpriced cause quantity is very bad and the worst above all is that when you are done with the orders and enjoying the eve with your food or drinks, they want you to finish early, roaming around you for obvious reasons. In short, the experience of the cafe is  make you uncomfortable and you don't feel worth the money you spent. "

4,Celebrated my girlfriend’s birthday last night. We reserved the mezzanine level. Nischal was amazing in coordinating it and the waiter we had was very attentive and pleasant. Would definitely book a party here again. Awsm Experience 🔥
5,"Visit to this place on Christmas was a disappointment. They were poorly stocked on beers, with only the priciest brands and quantities being available. That too on a holiday weekend when one would expect more. What's the point of offering menu cards carrying items (ref : beers) that are mostly unavailable?! Music can be much better. Food (starters: peanut masala, honey chilli potatoes) was the only good part of the experience. "
6,The drinks menu was pretty good and they're running 2+1 discount on all drinks menu. Christmas vibes.
