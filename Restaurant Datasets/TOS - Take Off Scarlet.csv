34,"Take off Scarlet is a lounge that has been in business since long. I am regular visitor so I decided to visit this beautiful lounge once again on the occasion of Halloween. The whole area was decorated with haunted items like skulls, cut outs of witches, pumpkins, spider webs and other scary decorative items. They have a two floor dining area where the first floor is fit for people who love to party as it has the dance floor and is always buzzing with loud music. The 2nd floor is comparatively quieter with soothing music and amazing ambience. As for the food, I ordered drums of heaven and lemon chicken as starters, both of which were succulent and flavoursome. I also ordered a peri peri...read more"

38,"Today, I had a weird experience at take off Scarlet. I was asked to write a good review in return of a complimentary dessert and as a normal Indian citizen, I agreed. I wrote a good review and showed the guy, he took a picture and they said it'll be given whenever I ask for it. Now the non-communicative and hypocritic staff they have, denied me the complimentary dessert after getting there work done. The manager or whoever that guy was had a rude tone and wasn't giving us any privacy even though the restaurant wasn't even half filled. That was a mood spoiler. The hookah didn't even last for half an hour I had like ten puffs. The manager didn't like the intimacy probably because of the age...read more"

61,The food was extremely delicious but I felt the quantity was a bit less in paneer tikka.Manuchiran was the best of all the dishes.The dj was also good but he didn't play songs on demand that was only a little thing they should improve.Ambience and service were extremely good and quick.

64,Best place to chill with friends in Punjabi Bagh affordable they serve good food have a good dance floor as they service are amazing But I am not satisfied with there loud music It wass to loud as also creating a noise pollution and make headache 
65,Its an amazing place to visit with your friends. They serve delicious food and beverages and they also have rooftop sitting so that we can enjoy the weather also. Its a must visit cafe in PUNJABI BAGH. TAKE OFF SCARLET. 
66,"Went there on my friend's birthday. We ordered chicken , paneer tikka, hookah , several cocktails, beer buckets, etc. And the food was good. And the brownie with icecream was very very delicious. "
67,"We went there few days back. That day there was quite large gatherings. The first good thing about the place is it's ambience. The rooftop one, the dj one, the closed space one it was very appreciable. But what we didn't like there was the staff which was less in number and because of that they were struggling to serve us. Our order took too long and also the rum like old monk wasn't available. We're sure they could provide much good service and food when people are less in number there as we have heard."
68,I visited this place 1 week before and thought of to review this place now as I got time I don't have pictures of this place but I have a lot of memories and damn good experience here which was so mesmerizing and was the bestest experience in my whole life.The ambience as well as the service of the restaurant was just picture perfect and they were also treating me like a king of the palace and their desserts are yummmmmm like honestly I didn't have such desserts ever before I honestly loved it very much and I liked itRecommended place

72,"One word for this place is HUGE… The TOS is famous for its drinks, food and vibes. It has something to offer to every class of people whether you need to throw a party, spend time with your family or friends or just want to grab a few drinks this is the place. We were a bit early and that too on a weekday, so the vibes were relaxed and as the time passed slowly the crowd filtered into the shadowy space. .We hadTandoori chilly chickenButter chicken maggi masalaChicken chaat kulchaWe really loved the food over here and will love toVisit them again."
73,"When it comes to hang out with friends over food or drinks, this place called TOS is on the top of our list. The ambience as well as the vibes as this place are so amazing. Coming to food I would suggest you some must try dishes here. Do try dal makhani shots with naan, chicken pita pocket and handi biryani  with mix raita. Dal makhani shots are a good twist to regular dal makhani, dal makhani is very flavorful with lots of cream in it. Pita pocket has good filling of chicken with minimum spices, I just love it taste with tahini sauce. And biryani is cooked slowly with veggies and gravy... it taste so well with chilled raita. You should definitely try this and thank me later ;)"

Though it is packed but offered a good space for a corporate party of 13. Service was a bit slow. In food everything was good like Arrabiata Pizza , chilli chicken, Alfredo Pasta, Murg malai tikka, paneer tikka , Fish in chilly oyster sauce, Dal makhani and paneer Lababdar was on the table. Their presentation is commendable ! Overall it was a good experience !"

104,I visited the place with my 3 friends .First when we placed order for our drinks they bought all in one big glass and asked us ti serve ourselves and then give us roadside used plastic glasses for drink . Food quality and quantity both were very bad .Not recommended place for anyone.
105,Good place for hangout .. Reasonable place and staff support is very good ... I suggest all to once go and live your life there ...
106,"Fine lounge with not so expensive food and drinks thanks to nearby always fully filled by very young crowd,only draw back is blarring music which is too loud even in afternoon, overall a pocket friendly option."
107,Mr Hoshiyar Singh was very hospitable and sweet
108,One of my favorite lounge and this place is really good. Food was average and the service was quite slow. The decor and interior were catching eyes and rooftop is also really great.￼
109,I went here on 14th Feb. Worst experience of my life. Ordered crispy corn and drums of heaven both were pathetic. No service manners. And the place was looking like a make out place. Not at all a family place. Will never ever visit such place. Even 1star it doesn’t deserve
110,The rooftop is amazing. Foods was good . I went to this place with my friends .they liked it very much . I tried pizza. Oreo shake.
111,"One of the most famous places in Punjabi Bagh, Take Off Scarlet will not disappoint you when it comes to taking instaworthy pictures and ambience. The rooftop view is amazing and so is the food."
112,I recently visited this cafe in.punjabi bagh. I really liked the ambience . The food was good and hot . But the service was slow

114,"Hospitality is extremely poor here. Servers are respecting customers, handling 3-4 tables at a time and rushing here and there and top of it their manager is not taking any action against this inappropriate and disrespectful behaviour. Never visit this place."
115,"I visited this place 2 months back. Place was totally packed up during the early evening and was too noisy. I took a call to sit on the terrace , which is beautifully designed. Food was below average."
116,"Visited here with friend as we was looking for weekend hangout place. They have indoor and outdoor both seating space. They have option of live screening of sports also.Tried Pizza, Mocktails and Pasta. Food and drinks was good, service was slow which can be better."
117,Went to the place on new year's eve.It was crowded at that time byt the staff managed the crowd very nicely.The place have a dj and a the cafe is also roof top.Food and drinks were nice .Staff was courteous.Highly recommended
118,"Food served was really fresh and hygienic, drinks served in proper manner Staff was generous and highly attentive despite alot of consumers inside ,they efficiently attended all of their customers. their pizzas and baked nachos were dream. Though a lil spicy but good for the taste and kick ."
119,"Great ambience, Great Food, Great Service, Friendly Staff. Everything is perfect here. Will definitely go back to this place especially on weekends"
120,"This cafe is One of my favourite lounges in West Delhi. It is located on the main road of Punjabi Bagh club road. The decor and interiors were eye catching. They also has a terrace sitting arrangement and is also great for clicking pictures. Coming to the food, they have so many options to choose from, it takes quite some time to decide. At first we had few cocktails and after that we had few starters, like paneer tikka, chicken tikka and chilly chicken is delecious. I really liked their butter chicken with naan. A very classy place for a date, the price is very good considering the offering and quantity being served."
121,"This is one the places i'd love to visit again. I went there with my friends and fell in love with the ambience at first sight. The choice of music here was too good We all enjoyed here alot  Spacious enough to dance Visited many cafe in PUNJABI BAGH but didnt find dj anywhere except this place This cafe provides both indoor and outdoor seating The outdoor seating which is a rooftop The hospilatily is commendable and the food is made with love which tastes amazing. This place also offers alcoholic drinks and hookah. . SO, we ordered VEG NOODLES: full of veggies tastes okayish VEG PIZZA MARHERITA: the crust of pizza was so soft, the amount of veggies on it was...read more"
122,This is one of the best lounges in West Delhi. The DJ and photographers are so much better here than much places. The food is equally great. The ambience is really good. Staff is very friendly and helpful. I'd definitely recommend you to check this place out.
123,looking for some good martini and Manhatten on a rooftop in delhi in winter season...then TOS is your place... i loved the whiskey-based mocktails at this place... the prepared some of the best snacks with drinks be it cheesy anchos or peri fries... and yes i am mentioning it again the Manhatten was something i really loved... if you are a mocktail person and love the miled yet strong drinks then come here and drink their Manhatten and you will come back again and again...
124,We visited this place thinking it would be great but sorry to say it was a horrible place Thier service sucks. For everything we kept on shouting and asking 10 times still they were not able to deliver what we wanted. But they want 10% service charge which according to law is not mandatory to pay by customer we asked them to remove it but they didn't. They charged us 250/- in the name of service charge which was not even worth for 5/- please don't visit this place this was their service when there where no customer so you can think what they'll do when it'll be crowded. Worst experience 👎👎👎
125,"Food tasted good, one thing which was very ajeeb is that when we asked for onions with food they said no onions will be served complimentary, we know onion prices are quite high these days, but if you are charging so high then giving a little of it will not create any difference, even the local vendor in our colony serves onion.Very baddd"
126,"there was no management . very late service. food was not good at all . we had corns ..but there served cold , spring rolls wasnt good either . the bread with pasta had a hair in it . worst experience"
127,"Over hyped place completely. It's not that big. Music is average. Went there on NYE and they made us on terrace, it was too cold that night. No one was bothered to serve food and absolute mismanagement!"
128,"This place has got a very beautiful terrace with has a sitting area. Also a floor that is club with an amazing DJ. The rate for food is not worth paying off.Service - 1/5Staff -3/5DJ -5/5food -3/5 .We had chilli noodles, white sauce veg pasta , chilli potato, chilli panner, premium beer, sheesha.They have got a worst service. Better to visit other places rather than wasting your time here.Also they did not provide a printed bill to you .. they ask you to pay before eating... quite disappointing."
129,"ToS has a great ambience and great music. The dhols are a plus. The food is really great and the presentation is good. We tried Makhani pasta, crispy fried corn and pizzas. Everything was tasty at a great price."
130,I went to this place .The food was not up to the mark first of all .The service was so slow .They were not interested to attend us as well .Very disappointed from this place .I have heard a lot about this place and i didn't find it good .Needs a lot of improvement.
131,"This place is located in punjabi bagh. I went here for my birthday. Perfect place for winter evening, amazing vibes. The ambiance was so soothing. The staff was helpful and very polite. Food was really delicious. We loved it. Everything was perfect. It is 5/5 place. Must try."
132,The quantity of starters and dishes is very very less.It should be three times the amount they give.That means you're giving huge amount for only One-Third portion.So you must keep that in mind before visit.
133,It was a great experience of dj in daytime. Good dj and dhol which was cherry on top.
134,A visited this place few days ago..Great ambience with loud disco music..A nice place to hangout with friends..I ordered a white sause pasta..It was deliciousRecommend😍
135,This is a very beautiful place with rooftop ambience and DJ and Dhol is really nice there. The staff is really patient.
136,"We visited this place on a Sunday night which is located in punjabi bagh. The ambience to the service to the food, everything is awesome.The decor of the restaurant makes a good settings. The place have good vibe and they also have an open bar. The service is very good here, we were served by manager who was prompt and attentive. Coming to the food, they have so many options to choose from, it takes quite some time to decide. Whatever you order will not disappoint. Everything we tried was great."
137,"Briyani had very thick rice which felt greasy while peri peri fries were very thin and oily. Didn’t like the food here.Although they have great offers on drinks and the staff is good, food isn’t upto the mark."
138,"Recently visited this cafe they have lovely ambience & they have two floors with terrace also music was good .I had chicken galafi seekh, crunchy cornmeal fried chicken, chicken wings which were unique and delicious etc..Staff were polite and helpfullittle disappointed wih delay service"
139,"Food was average, just Okay. Shitty place. Never suggest anyone to go here. pathetic staff i would say. they were too slow with the orders.👎"
140,"Ome of the oldest outlet in punjabi bagh club roadThe food here is goodPrices are a bit high according to the ambienceBut service here can be improvedMusic and all is good , they have a good terrace tooSheesha rates are a bit highRest its a good place and I will suggest all the veg items are superbAvoid chicken here"
141,"I visited the place on 24th October, the place was nice, the place was recommended by my friend who gave a good feedback about the food, ambience and services they. But, when we went there the major disappointment was the service. They delayed every order and had to remind again and again. The food was nice. But, as a consumer the service is also the important aspect we look for while choosing as place other than food.Me and my friends were disappointed and the time we planned at the place was extended because of which our next place where we planned to go was cancelled.My expectations in the future would be regarding services, which need to be bettered. Other than everything was nice. "
142,so i was there with my friends after seeing good reviews on this site but i want to tell that this is the worst place i have ever visited... prices are high as per the quantity and quality of the food.... and i booked the table in advance but we didnt found place to sit and one of the staff member told us to sit on the corner sofas which was fully torned... and even there toilets were dirty full of leakages... worst experience and strongly recommend that dont visit this place. even we have to order 2-3 times for placed the order and we felt neglected and we forcely picked the staff member and ordered him again then after we got our order. i think they just want money nothing else.
143,"If there was a negative rating, i would have given them that. Horrible place, horrible experience, horrible service, horrible staff. If there was something more horrible , i would have added that too. Worst place to be at. Guys, please don't visit it ever. There are better places in Punjabi bagh very near to them."
144,Visited this lounge. Their rooftop area have an amazing view...n well decorated n cleaned and has good points to click photographs if you're photogenic.Coming to the food that we've ordered were:1) Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani- Super Amazing and delicious plus their style of presentation was amazing. It took my heart the moment I saw Biryani in front of me😍2) Butter Chicken Fries- If you are fan of butter chicken...would recommend you to try this fries for once at last.☺3)Blue Heaven Freak Shake- This shake wasn't upto my expectations according to my tastebud. Nonetheless the Taste is ok according to me but not as good as it should be. 😉For more follow me on Instagram...read more
145,"A generally excellent spot in Punjabi Bagh and subject of the spot was astounding just appreciated the spot .nourishment was pleasant and tasty.The best thing about TOS was its mood and DJ. In nourishment we requested paneer tikka, dahi kababs, bean stew chicken, paneer momos and spring rolls. Just paneer momos was incredible, rest of the nourishment was not excessively great. Its a decent gathering spot with astonishing nourishment."
146,It is really nice rooftop cafe with amazing view and amazing food. Everything on the menu is delicious and it offers a wide variety on the menu. Do give this stunning cafe a visit!
147,"If you wanna party with great food good music and affordable liquor prices then this is the place for you , the terrace seating on 5th floor is ideal for a romantic date believe me its really well put place with ample area and serene ambience.I had veg platter and chicken malai tikka which were not bad at all and with wide variety of drinks on the menu .This place does not burn a whole in the pocket ,highly recommended."
148,"Please do ask for mineral water bottle,it is very expensive 75 plus taxes rest, qty of pasta is also very less it is not even for two"
149,"The DJ clearly doesn’t know volume. Period. If it’s a pub, it would be advertised as a pub. It’s not a place to chill or hang out. "
150,Really poor service.. we literally had to keep a tap on the waiters every time so as to just keep a track of our food.. all in all a bad experience for the first time. 
151,We had a party there.. Dj was so good.. Ambience was totally perfect.. Crowd was amazing.. Mostly Food item was amazing to eat
152,A very good place in Punjabi Bagh and theme of the place was amazing just enjoyed the place .food was nice and tasty.specially pizza was awesome 🤐😳😄
153,Went to TOS with family. To celebrate birthday . Place was good . Interior is nice and cozy . Service and food was very good. Enjoyed their non veg and veg platters . Liit was not up to the mark. One more family was there to celebrate there birthday . We were waiting for the time 12 and they requested for happy birthday song . Dj played for 10 sec and then closed and went away . There was a manager who is has french beared and he was rude . It's closed he said . Very bad . And the best part is there toilets are like public toilets . I was waiting outside toilet and staff was using same toilet. No ventilation. Bad smell . Female toilet was very bad no maintance. Will never come again...read more
154,I came here for a friends bday party and its a really nice place. They have various varieties and the taste is also nice. The only thing thats not nice is service.
155,"A group of friend throw a party at this place last week. The place is really nice and hipster,good space and dance floor. We dance here a lot and enjoyed so much. Food and drinks weregood and nice staff, very caring and accommodating."
156,I went there for my birthday. The ambience is quite good. But what disappointed me was the service. I literally had to ask twice for anything. At first I was seated in the outdoor seating. It started raining so we had to ask them to shift indoor. The music is too loud. Literally had to shout on top of my voice to get anything.All in all it's a good place to enjoy if the service is improved. 
157,"The mood of the spot is marvelous. Enjoyed their beverages much that arrangement is immaculate particularly their whisky sour.The outlet is roomy and with an inconspicuous inside. Also, the dj was great.Dal makhani and spread chicken with lancha parantha garlic naan and shakes n cold coffeeThe nourishment is credible, excessively delectable and the beverage are reviving. Staff administration is great Overall."
158,"The dj here is simply astounding. The vibe of the spot is marvelous. Loved their beverages much that structure is immaculate particularly their whisky harsh. We request Panner tikka, spring rolls, dahi ke sholey, fish n chips, murgh angari tikka with virgin mojito, watermelon n mint sangria,everything was good.Their sustenance is wonderful. The staff is mindful and dynamic. I would profoundly suggest this spot in Punjabi Bagh."
159,Literally no management of bookings. On Saturday they would give on 10 person's seat on the booking 0f 18. And when you find a place yourself . They would fight with you for same. Person named Vikas will literally go to any extent to make you vacant table
160,"Pathetic service, bad ambience, gross crowd, way too loud music and it's like it was made 10 years ago and never had a chance to get renovation. It's just sad."
161,We settled for the indoor sitting area instead of the rooftop. The rooftop would have been better than the indoor sitting because it was spacious and seats were not closely packed like in the indoor area. The sitting area was very clumsy and the interior was also poorly maintained. Some of the sofas were also in very bad condition as they were damaged. The food was also below average. We ordered baked nachos and chilly mushrooms. Both the dishes were quite a disappointment. The one single thing that I liked the most was the courteous and well behaved staff.
162,"I went to TOS with a group of friends on sunday. It was very crowded. Service was very poor. We had to ask for a particular thing almost 8-10 times only then we used to get it. The best thing about TOS was its ambience and DJ. In food we ordered paneer tikka, dahi kababs, chilli chicken, paneer momos and spring rolls. Only paneer momos was great, rest of the food was not that good. Its a nice party place with amazing sheesha but they really have to improve on the services.My second visit to TOS was extremely bad. That is why I am updating and giving 1 star to them. The service is extremely extremely bad. Even after calling them and waving at them, the waiters will not look at you. Once...read more"
163,The sound of dj was too loud. Even the customer service was also too late. Though food was average..

167,I threw my birthday party at TOS. Though the food was tasty but service wasnt up to the mark. 
168,I liked this place. The DJ was great. It was a bit loud but no problem. They don't allow us to wear shorts or kurtas there which i thought was wrong. The food was fine 
169,This is not a good restaurant for party freaks.The food we ordered was served very late and ambience is also small.The other lounges Raftaar and AIR are better than TOS! 
170,I have been there 2 times with friends and both the time I got disappointed. The service was too much late. And the food was also not good. Its having open terrace as well. 
171,Take of scarlet is an amazing place and the only place that is doing good in the whole Punjabi bagh club roadWhen I went there the rooftop was under constructionSo we all had to sit in the tos areaSo I ordered alot of dishesButter chickenMuttonGarlic naanLiitHukka was greatChicken tandooriRTandoori Paneer pizzaPeri peri pizzaAnd alot of thingsAnd going there was worth my moneyAnd I would go there again as well.

176,"Too overcrowded, too loud. The place is good if you feel like dancing(in heavy crowd), not for meetings, gatherings etc. Overhyped ppace in Punjabi bagh. Food was nice.If the weather is good, its advised to enjoy the food at the terrace🤩✌"
177,Food was okay here.Music here is really loud that sometimes becomes irritating.Service is quite slow because of the crowd. You have to wait for your order for a long time.
178,"Pretty impressive! Nothing to complain as everything was just right!! I would have given it a 5* had it had a better parking setup, but I guess 4 stars ain't that bad, are they?"
179,"Take off Scarlet is totally a drool worthy location in terms of ambience and food, let’s not forget their incredible dj as well. I was there for a friend’s party and we had lots of fun.We ordered watermelon and mint sangria and it was dope. We also ordered sex on the beach and liit- both of them were amazing as well.Chaap is something that I always try. Here I ordered chilli Soya chaap and it was yummilicious. Chilli paneer was also delicious.If you are looking for fun along with great food and perfect ambience then TOS is definitely worth it. Do visit it."
180,"The place was disgusting - when asked for a cold drink, they give u a can, when asked glass for that cold drink was given dirty filthy glass, food wasnt that good too. The hookah was pathetic.Most disgusting of all was there being a mouse on the sofa we were sitting - A MOUSE. I wish we saw it before so we could leave before. And when we told this to the manager and showed the mouse there on the sofa he looked unfazed saying there is construction happening - then close the damn place na. Keep it shut. He said next there will be a discount. Damn yaar what if all we ate was infected. Please stay away from the place."

Ambience wise the place didnt impress me much it was like most usual lounges are around nothing much good.Lets talk about food , I tried below items Kit Kat Shake - Tasted nice but wasnt chilled at the firs place , i had to ask to get it changed Chicken n Chips - Fried chicken , Fries and mayo really liked the fried chicken but the mayo was bland a little flavour in that would have enhanced the taste of the chicken Alferedo Chicken Pasta - Pasta tasted nice , not bad and nothing great at all . Service wise the place...read more"
520,"this place is quite good, i personally like the rooftop area here. weekends are always a delight to get over to this lounge. talking about food it's kind of normal not that amazing as i expected it to be but i personally like the chicken barbecue pizza. overall great party place for a gang of party animals. :)"
521,"We went to this place for a birthday celebration . Ordered whole lot of food there like pasta , chilly potato , pizza , spring roll  and 3 coolers .. all these have amazing taste especially pizza and chilly potato , we ordered the garden fresh pizza with all the veggies . Also it’s really affordable for alcohol , they serves drinks which are not expensive , there was dj , dhol and photographer .. loved it "
522,"Nice place in Punjabi Bagh I had celebrated my birthday.... Order chilly chicken, drums of heaven, honey chilly potato, the taste was good... Every, Saturday they have DJ night the price is reasonable must go and enjoy I will ratefood 4/5Ambience 4/5Service 4/5"
523,"Worst experience ever with the food and service we got and mainly the Desert cooler in a lounge , seriously man. I would suggest not to waste your money over there because of the atmosphere and environment here."
524,"The focus is only on filling the space they have to offer. Poor lighting, poor service and poor portions especially if you have applied any coupons, dont have high hopes. After much questioning nobody could explain why the air-conditioner wasnt working. The entire floor area was packed with people doing hukka with people below 25 being offered liquor and no air to breathe or to enjoy what you had spent for..........................."
525,"We booked this place for my birthday evening. It was an amazing experience. They have 2 seating areas,indoor and outdoor. We visited both.we were a group of 14 people. They arranged a proper seating near the DJWhich I would recommend to avoid as the sound gets too loud with each passing hour. We couldn’t sit on the sofas as the roof was leaking due to AC vent. We bought some coupons from nearbuy which we redeemed here. Had some great deals. The food was good. The drinks were well prepared and served. The dhol was the attraction. The DJ was amazing. We also enjoyed some live music up on the rooftop. The singer was so soulful and melodious. We had a great time. The rooftop ambience was...read more"
526,"Interesting name, great concept, good menu, one of the most popular restaurants in the area. The food quality is great! Service could be a factor that can be improved. "
527,This is a famous bar and lounge in the Punjabi Bagh. This place  will give you immense pleasure. I really loved their interiors specially the terris and also they have good dj. We ordered mushrooms melted and nachos pizza 🍕 which were good in taste.
528,"Will not recommend anyone, Illigal practice is being followed They do not provide invoice copy post parties and ask to pay by cash only. Avoid generating invoice. However service and venue is good server is very nice. But hardly visit again. "
529,"I visited TOS last week. I had a great tym with my friends i  their we orderd arabita pizza and a maxican chicken pizza both the items were good in taste then we orderd peri peri chicken popcorn one of my fav. I was fully satisfied with the crunchy and spicy taste, White sauce pasta was also good in taste moving on drinks we had oreo shakes, kitkat shake and virgin mojito. Mojito was so refreshing i personally appriciate for that as well as the shakes were also remarkable. Then we had vanilla brawonie chocolate dessert i loved it . Talking about ambiance i liked it alot the crowed was friendly and the DJ part was awesome and i enjoyed my day recommendable place . KEEP IT UP #TOS"
530,Thank you - Management @ TOS for the experience to remember. Shall not visit again and also will never recommend to anyone. Not recommended for families & corporate parties. Amex not acceptable ...Prefers to host parties with cash payments without billing. Incredible in 2019 !!Though must appreciate the server. Gem of a person and a thorough professional. Regret as I forgot his name.

533,I visited TOS with my friends for a fun evening. The ambience was good and the dj sets the mood for the party with good music. The service was a bit slow but the staff was courteous. The dishes we ordered there were :-MURG MALAI TIKKA - Great taste with the right amount of cream and perfectly cooked.KIT KAT SHAKE - Thick shake with crushed KitKat which soothes your thirst.KADHAI CHICKEN - One of the best I had. Perfect mix of spices and great tasting chicken and when combined with BUTTER NAAN just enhances it's taste.PANEER LABABDAR- It was okayish but tasted good with LACHCHA PARATHA.In dessert we had HOT WALNUT BROWNIE with ICE-CREAM- The brownie tasted fresh and good in taste but...read more

Food was also yummy , as we tried pasta , chicken pop-corn , paneer tikka pizza , barbeque pizza , oreo shake , virgin mojito .Had an amazing experience there and would also suggest to try this outlet ."
535,This lounge can't even share the pics of my birthday vacation it made my worst birthday ever and charges more then worth so guys pls be careful before u visit this place 
536,AC not working. Not a good place to sit with friends.In spite of asking to manager and staff no action taken.We expect at least to have cool environment in such a hot weatherI hope they look at the issue and rectify the same.
537,"so yesterday i went to this place with my friends . this property is really very good .They have proper sitting arrangements, great ambience & cooperative staff. In food we order some arrabiata pasta ,paneer tikka pizza, peri peri chicken popcorn, tandoori chicken pizza ,KitKat shake ,Oreo shake, Virgin mojito .I really like their chicken popcorn because it was too crunchy and yummy served with mayonnaise dip . Totally worth it place must try this ."
538,"Tos is a very old and famous outlet in punjabi bagh. today i went to this outlet with my friends and had great fun their .  we ordere paneer tikka pizza , peri-peri chicken pop-corn , white sauce pasta , brownie & ice-cream . Service was also fast . Food was too delicious . Totally worth it . Must try this outlet once"

540,"The food was good but the cocktails could be prepared better. The terrace looks great at night. The servers are nice and polite. I heard a lot about this place from friends, so tried it. They play very peppy Punjabi songs. It was a good experience, the place is more suited for school and college pass outs."
541,A good place for hosting parties and spending time with freinds.Has a good dance floor and dj.Food and ambience Both are good.Overall the place is nice and is worth the money.
542,Had a lot of fun with my husband. Cheese nachos n little bit of hard drink makes a perfect combination. Kudos..!!!Looking forward to visit TOS again.
543,"TOS is one of the elegant and evergreen lounge of all Punjabi bagh . But it has degraded its food quality a bit much from some time back when it got hyped by people. Now they don't allow stags to enter . They keep checks on your outfit. But you would be served cocktails and other drinks still.tes sheesha is served here . Coming on to food quality it is average .Ambience still is best in class of all lounges of PB.Sitting on rooftop with decent music over some dri ks, Sheesha and nice food is the thing i love about Take Off scarlet"
544,This place is good but lacks in food quantity.Crowd is good service is average. Please if you visit here must try chicken dishes. Veg starters and starters like pasta are also average here.I will advice to visit here for mocktails and dj.Overall an average place
545,"I’ll never visit here again. Third class service, staff were rude and very unprofessional. Our order took so much time and the staff was very careless i told them again n again for each things like ice, tissue etc. And the worst part is AC (Air Condition) didn’t work. Food was okay. But i don’t like the ambiance and service. I regret why i booked this place."
546,"Visited this place today and I must say I didn't have the great experience as I was expecting the service is so delayed and in response to that I had to leave the place before my food reach on my table, really the ambience was too dark therefore it was very difficult to read the menu. I'm really disappointed with place I think I'm not going to visit this place again for sure, and not going to suggest any of friends or colleagues to visit this place. "
547,"A very shitty place with a poor service and an equally shitty food. Very loud and unpleasant music, poor DJ. I won't recommend this place to anybody."
548,"Had the worst experience here. The staff is very bad, not even listening to the customers. Manager is rude. Would not recommend this place to anyone"
549,"One of the best places in Punjabi bagh. Be it the ambience, be it food or services. This place got the best of all. At the top of it, it is the best party location.Was here recently and had some amazing things which included the amazing chilly paneer for which I'd be visiting the place soon again.The dahi ke kebabs were awesome and couldn't have been any better.We had virgin mojito for coolers and they were like any other mojito.But it was one hell of an experience and we would be visiting the place soon again."
550,Visited the place very recently and had an amazing experience. We were there for lunch and had sone amazing things.The staff was really supportive and the services were really really good. The best part about the place is its ambience. It even has a rooftop which is best suited for the evenings.We had some dahi ke kebabs which were just as awesome as they could be.We also had some peri peri fries which were just way too good.We had kiwi coolers for the drinks.Would definitely be visiting the place super soon
551,Ambience was good. Food was tasty also. But there was a problem with the electricity frequently. AC was slow. It could have been a better experience. Service was good. 
552,"The place is highly over hyped, or maybe it was good at the beginning but they couldn't handle the fame. They say that stags are not allowed, but at my visit, there were more than 3 groups of just guys, so what kind of stags are not allowed then ? The place has service slower than th crawling of tortoise, the food is average, the waiter took more than 15 minutes just to give me my bill. Once i ordered one thing, i couldnt see any person of staff around to order more things, due to which i only ate what i had ordered in the first go. Would not recommend this place at all."
553,"DJ and ambiance is great, good place for beer and hookah lovers but food is very disappointing. Food is tasteless. Tried most of the veg dishes but taste was below average."
554,Rooftops ambiance is great. They follow strict rules for playing dance songs after 9pm only.. Rest is great and polite workers.... Live music and separate sitting are also there with good combo offers at different apps. 
555,"This is a horrendous piece of shit, they are actually a disgrace on the name of the restaurant industry. I booked my table and they created a scene at the place the guard asked for money to let me in, like what is this place a strip club or what. Stupid in terms of everything. The food, later on, was so ridiculous that I didn't even eat here if you want to ruin your day you should definitely go here."
556,"Not very satisfied with the restaurant,Though the food is good, but the service is very slow n poor and the quantity is very less according to the price. "
557,"Great ambience with great food.I visited their for the first time and i loved the food and drinks.Even the staff is very friendly too.Fish , pizza and biryani was really amazing and its highly recommend from my side.Drinks- 3.5/5Food- 4/5"
558,"A good place to party. Drinks are not that expensive. Food is really good. Ambience is okay. Like if you really party person, this is a good place. Music is also good. Best for parties and birthdays. "
559,Located in punjabi bagh Tos is a good cafe. l have been there couple of times. The dj is very good and plays really cool songs to which people dance. The food is really very tasty. And the mocktails and cocktails are really really good!! In mocktails do try their kiwi strawberry mocktail.

562,"Certainly a good place to spend time with friends. The atmosphere here is pretty decent, and the music and food makes it much better. The prices are very reasonable. The food options are great, though service can be improved. Italian cuisine is great. Definitely a place to be if you are into cocktails and stuff. "

591,"Ambience &Presentation was goodFood, service, quality, taste everything needs improvement as per the cost for 2 people Hygiene factors were okay...!!!!!!!!!"
592,"They are so so so weak in service and management thing, shown my gold privileage in the starting, still at first they didnt reedemed it, ordered bruschetta and waited for almost 1 and half hour, because the order taker ordered some icecream, it was on my list to visit from so long , but the service was really disappointing.Anyways food and ambience is really good."
593,"This place has always been my “will be back soon” of kind. Reasons ?1. Pics are heavenly 2. Adorable rooftop3. Food is no badHowever, I missed the utter generosity of the staff and non-cooperative behaviour of the waiter has actually made me melancholic."
594,"Good Food but in weekends orders take long time.All drinks are available , Good choice of liquor . Crazy themes night are so interesting. Food is also good."
595,Absolutely unprofessional waiting/serving. Had to wait for 15 mins until I got the glasses of water. Recieved cold food. Not worth the gold.
596,"Ambience of Take Off Scarlet is really good, specially at night. The food is average. Beverages are good. Service is good. Its an ideal place for college going students. They can have a great party here "
597,"Even after pre-booking, they gave us a very tight seating. We were 10 and we got a table for 6 in the corner of the restaurant. We had to adjust on a table which reminded me of train's seating. The service was very poor . Every time we wanted to order something, we had to go and call the waiter to come and take the order . The food was ok . The whole place smelled like hookah. Lighting isn't good.. but it's okay if you're there to dance .The terrace was much better, had good views and good seating but sadly they don't serve food there.."
598,"Best place to hangout. Affordable with satisfying services. Staff is pretty good specially Anurag the most supportive,helpful and on of the best staff of this place."
599,Pathetic service by the management and they are very rude ..... tasteless food and their quantity portion is very small ....they don't have manners how to talk to customer and they use stale chicken

603,"Nice place to hangout.it has some great delicacies with polite staff and a happening crowd.But but the space for dancing is quite congested.Overall good place to hangout.Food-Pasta,pizza is good."
604,"Poor services, people Don't listen to you. First order took 50 mints to come to our table.Food was not that great as mention in all below reviews.Overcharged in Bill, they made mandatory to pay you service charges which is at client discretion.Not worth at all."
605,I loved take off scarlet ! Visited this place with some of my friends and i loved the ambience and food ! We ordered Oreo shake and paneer tikka and it was very tasty
606,"They serve non veg food if you order veg. Highly unprofessional behavior of the staff. If you are a vegetarian, then you should never visit such place. After doing so many mistakes they insist for bill payment."
607,"📍Location : TOS: Take Off Scarlet, Punjabi BaghSo this place had been in my go to list for really long time, but as it's a little far from where I put up, it took me a little long to visit here. The indoor area is a little loud and you can enjoy the dance and music there. But for having a conversation and to relax prefer their rooftop area which is beautiful.I loved their drinks they were really refreshing and the service was quick.In frame: drink 1. Coco Loco (Price : approx 230) (4/5)Drink 2. Virgin Marry (Price : approx 230) (3.5/5)Pasta: (Price : Approx 300) (4/5)Thai Spring Rolls : (Price : approx 300) (4/5)(Overall Cost for two : approx 1200, Zomato Gold...read more"

610,Club is good food music very nice service very good Mr anurag such nice person i apest with do for service I happy for food lovely experience
611,It's the worst place i ever seen no professional service and lots of delay in serving food. No manner to talk to the visitors. If its in my hands i wouldn't like to give even a single star. It will shutdown soon
612,Worst experience really disappointed. All staff was very rude . I will never ever recomend to anyone for this place please never vist to this bar restaurant .
613,Staff's behaviour is really pathetic and unprofessional.Going to this place was a terrible experience !Even this much is not enough to share such a nasty experience with such a staff !
614,"Amazing place, just pretty amazing. Great drinks, great food, went their with friends on farewell, danced a lot. Will want to visit again, do try their LIIT if anyone visits, it's pretty good. Nice ambience to have a good time"
615,Club is okay but the services they did to my friends on 25th of April was gross and never expected from such professional cafe. Never want to visit this place ever again. Nice appreciation for your services.
616,"Take off has huge name but they failed at their hospitality, staff or the manager were unprofessional and not cooperative. Dj was the only thing which give the star factor else null!"
617,"Worst place ever. Arrogant, undignified staff. Shittiest service. Boycott TOS. Never suggest Anyone to go here. Worst experience ever had. The staff will get to your nerves. The service will test your patience to the core. You'll only return disappointed. "
618,Service is very dissapointing waiters keep themselve busy in seeing crowd they even dont know how to talk in a decent way. This is very dissapointing for tosThey are not up to mark. Ridiculous
619,"We had our farewell on 25th of April following which we planned an after party at Take off Scarlet, Punjabi Bagh. In the first round of entry at around 5 p.m , we were almost 15 people there out of which there were 5-6 girls. I clearly mentioned at the time of entry, there are 12 -15 more people in a ratio (3:10 | girls: boys) who'll be joining us shortly. Other members of our group were still on their way to the club. They were ten guys and two girls. They reached at 6. The music was so loud, I couldn't hear my phone ringing. They were not allowed to enter the building initially. The staff kept them waiting and insulted them. Thereafter, I talked to one of the staff(probably the manager)...read more"
620,"I have visited this place 2-3 times. If you judge it from it’s ambience, DJ, food and drinks, this place is good. But the service is very poor. The waiters keep themselves busy in watching the crowd dancing. If you have to order something you just have to sit there till they (by mistake) look at you and you can finally gesture them to come on your table. They have their own attitude and they manage to ignore your call sometimes. Pathetic staff i would say, rest everything is fine. "
621,Worst lounge in the whole Delhi. Managers and staff don’t manners and basic etiquettes to talk and deal with customers. I would give -5 stars to them
622,"Nice service, nice ambiance, good food.... Its my 3rd visit. I ordered chilly chicken and chicken popcorn, both are tasty.. And these two guys Mr. Kadim and Manager Sudhir were nice and very polite. Love this place.. We will visit this place again"

625,"tried this place last week, its really amazing, best staff and ambiance to party. Menu have a wide range to choose from. would recommend this place to everyone."
626,"After seeing lots of ads on Facebook, finally I visited this place yesterday to celebrate a birthday party.. And I am disappointed with service, food taste, management etc.First thing there is no maintenance thing, they are just running business. For proof one can check the condition of menu 😂Second thing- one group of 7 people was sitting on sofas. After sometime restaurant staff needed that sofa for another crowd and they shifted those people to individual sofas. And again after sometime restaurant staff again shifted them from sofas to chair.. that was funny and offensive bothThird -  I ordered chicken nachos but there was very less chicken piece Fourth- they took approx 30 min...read more"

632,We had lunch here a few times while in the town visiting family and friends. The servers here are just wonderful and have great memories it seems. We sat here for more than an hour because the ambience was soo soothing and enjoyed the big lamb burger which was so wholesome and stomach filling.Must try!

853,"You don’t want to miss this out!This bar comes to life at midnight. A perfect place to hangout with friends on a weekend. The music, ambience, food and liquor makes this place a very happening. A descent 50% of the drinks where available which were mentioned in the bar menu. The food stands out when comes to their presentation specially. We tried their Dahi Kebabs, Chilli Chicken and Veg Seekh Kebabs. All were equally good. The Dahi Kebabs were crispy and salty from outside and tender and little sweet from inside. It doesn’t fall apart after a bite and thats how well the curd was from inside. I being a fan on Indo-Chinese food fell in love with the chilli chicken. Everything was so...read more"
854,"So...Nothing as the fancy name suggests... Went there on Sunday n the place was almost empty. We chose the rooftop but immediately moved from there, as there was no feeling like you are on terrace🤦🏻‍♂️When the waiter handed me the menu, it was all torn up book with a surprise jump from a Lil Cockroach (i thought Stag entry was not allowed). We ordered food, it was okay (3.5/5), Ambience (3/5), Service (2/5) as we waited almost 15-20mins just for water, even when the place was empty. Cost of the food was not too high (5/5). "
855,"One of the worst managed lounge - TOS. Management tries their best to first reserve you if for Stag entry, and then denies once you reach there if the lounge is crowded as per their expectation. Gaurav - The manager confirmed our stag booking for 5 ppl when called on Saturday afternoon with clear statement about Stag. We all travelled for long to the lounge and they straight away denied about any such interaction happened. It’s not the first time that it happened but, second straight time in last 2 months that they denied entry post confirming the booking. Management is worst of all the lounges ever visited. Also, the food and the services are just below average. I would not...read more"

Price is reasonable compare to others lounge and cafe.Nonveg specifically Tandoori Chicken , Chilli Chicken and Mutton seekh kabab are rich in taste.In veg , fully loaded nachos is not worth while. Plain salted french fries is superb to have.Superb service 4 on 5Best place to visit for bollywood as well as punjabi songs lover.Good for dance lovers too.Awesome and reasonable place to visit on weekends."

876,"This is known as the best bar and rooftop seating restaurant in Punjabi Bagh. Well, must be good for bar(I didn’t try that) but not for rooftop seating. For me, this resto is good for food, not for service. The ambiance is though good but they lack in providing service at their terrace section. Service is slow, unprofessional and not at all courteous. Talking about food, it’s surprisingly good. We had chilly paneer, chilly garlic noodles and in drinks we had my sweet bae and strawberry-kiwi slush. Everything was extremely delightful. Also, I have seen this restaurant in “pocket friendly” section. Though the same is not true."
877,If we talk about ambiance and music this place is awesome.Important part which is missing service is slow and food is not that much good.overpriced food if we talk about quality and quantity not upto the mark.According to the supreme court guidelines its not compulsary to pay service charge but they charged even if you don't like the service still you have to pay which wrong.
878,Food is good and roof top sitting is fun but the staff is not that good and good service is a challenge. You have to provide zomato gold before order else they will refuse to take it amd this is what happend with me.I have order pita bread which is super awesome.Have ordered chicken pizza which was okaish.Ordered lemon fish which is nicely cooked and taste is also fine.Chicken roll is also good.
879,"This place is over rated, ambiance is good but senior staff is not well behaved, they treat Avery one like a bewda.Or bahut hi batamiji pe a jate hai or apne ko Malik batate hai they says they are owner (Gaurave and surjeet) behaved with us very cheap, to just aapni beijati karani ho wo Jaye tos Baki apne rajouri or Punjabi bagh me bahut clubs and restobars hai.Or ase staff ke sath koe bhi firm bahut dino tak nahi chalti me bhi 100 cr ki co.

882,Amazing place. Loved the food to the core. Truly a good pocket friendly bar. A great place to party your heart out with friends! Complete value for money. Highly recommended!
883,"It was an awsome experience at TOS. Superb ambience, perfect presentation, staff was excellent and the delivery was so quick. I have travelled across the globe however the time i had spent at TOS was the most memorable. Big thanks to the manager Sujeet ...he is an asset to the cafe. I request the higher authorites to recognize his work. With TOS i felt like having love at first sight. "
884,"We visited this place on Saturday night.First thing which I noticed was -- over crowded.Staff was not able to serve customers on time.We used zomato gold privilege here, ordered fish n chips and peri peri chicken and few other things.Fish was good, though peri peri needs some more expertiseOverall 1 time visit is good"
885,"This place is hyped in punjabi bagh.but it really puts a great effort to match the standards of the name it has created. Its a nice place to chill out with friends. Open terrace bar and dj gives u a great view and ambience it has some aura that u want to stay and enjoy. Great hookas, amazing food. Must visit with your friends to chill and party on amazing dj vibes."
886,Really bad service! The staff not cooperative at all. They didn't even serve us water even after having asked for it like 4 times. I don't feel like coming back to this place again. It was undoubtedly a gross experience.
887,If You are in a party mood with your Friends or GF so you should go to TOS. I would say it’s fabulous open bar cafe and a very beautiful looking ambience though. My first visit in TOS for my friend birthday party and I totally shocked when i saw the environment of all the ambience was awesome as well as staff also very polite and helpful in nature. Now come to the food department as we all loved food so food is also good. I ordered many drinks and they are fabulous in taste. I like every single food items. I personally request to all if you want to rock then go to TOS and just flow your mood in TOS atmosphere. 
888,"Recommended: Go to other cafes around instead of this place.This place used to be a hyped one in PUNJABI BAGH because of it's delicacies, service and reasonable pricing. Though no doubt the standards have been dropped.Starting from ambience, it is cheerful with DJ alongside but sometimes the pathetic crowd spoils the enjoyment and the kind managers and waiters pay no heed to it even after being requested. The staff is not welcoming (used to be) as one will have to call them again and again even for placing order.The food has turned just average, cocktails being flavour water and shakes even are below average.On my recent visit, orderedCHICKEN GALAFI SEEKH (3/5), MURGH MALAI TIKKA...read more"
889,I came here for my college society freshers party . The food is good but the service is slow. Ambiance is pretty good and loved the live music. P.S : The terrace is a bonus for your instagram !
890,"The service is awful. They don't serve you water until you order. Other being, the place known for good music and DJ, on our visit last friday, they didn't provide us with the promised environment telling the DJ is not here yet and excuses like he is on his way and eventually they played a music so irritating for the whole one an a half hour. "
891,First of all ambience is really great. secondly Dj there is really great. terrace is well developed. staff is friendly and good is also nice.
892,"The food here in Take Off Scarlet is really good and worth a try. The Ambience as we all know is lit with proper Dj lights and A well known DJ. But, the service here is not too responsive and the staff is quiet rude. We almost got into a fight with one of the bouncers there as he was talking to our friend with no respect...."
893,Its a good restraunt to spend time with you friends the DJ is also very good if you r looking to dance it off with your friends . The prices are expensive but the food is good .  Altogether you can gove it a try with your gang. 
894,Had a very bad experience at Take off Scarlett. The management needs to make sure that the staff treats their customers well.Never going back to this place. 
895,Never going back to this place again!Had a pathetic experience at Take off Scarlet and the staff doesn't know how to treat customers. Wouldn't recommend it at all.
896,Person name Gaurav didn’t allowed me to use gold service as per him he can deny if he want however before reaching I called him and asked specifically that can I use Zomato gold he said YES. I reached at 9:55 pm and called him around 9:30pm. We were sitting like stupid calling waiter he at 10:16 he came for order I told him that I am gold member he said wait I’ll go and check then he said ok I am sending to my senior then he again came and ask for the order I showed the code again he was about to click code picture in his phone then again he said I will be back in 2 minutes we Waited for his never ending 2 minutes he came after 10 min and said you have to sit in open area if you want...read more

912,One of the best places to visit in Punjabi bagh. The food is amazing and the ambience is great. The crowd is good with a decent atmosphere. I had a great time here. Looking forward to visit it again.
913,"TOS has always been a brand in terms of lounge and cafe in punjabi baghThe drinks were lovely but when it comes to food the price offered is good(affordable) but the taste needs to be approved. I tasted dahi ke kabab in which I felt that it didn’t have salt in it..Hazelnut shake, kitkat shake and oreo shake was yum!Fries were crispy and good😍but if you are a pizza lover then dont step into this place, “worst pizza” I repeat worst pizza I ever had in my entire life...Overall I would give food- 1/3Ambience 2/2"
914,"It's a nice place for family get together and also you can hangout with your friends at this place. The ambience is quite pretty and the food is tasty. Overall, my experience was nice. But the thing that might get you a problem here can be the extravagant prices. As per me, I guess the food was expensive. That's all."
915,"TOS has always been a brand when it comes to lounge in punjabi bagh.From the cool rooftop seating to the loud and vibrant DJ, this place will give you some of the best vibes.The only downside of this place is the food.They really need to work upon it."

918,PATHETIC SERVICE AND RUDE STAFF.Had a really bad experience at Take off Scarlett.The waiter wasn't courteous and refused to serve even water till we placed an order. The manager didn't seem to care when we got this to his notice.Never visiting this place again. 
919,"I have visited this place twice😍 because i love the ambience and the food😍. Tos is super amazing place for couples friends and even for family. Talking about food.. The food they serve is quite good in taste.. I ordered pesto pepper pizza, Alfredo pasta, garlic noodles, oreo shake, brownie shake. I must say i can't decide my favorite among these.. All are amazing at their own way. Pasta was well cooked and veggies were tossed. Veggies in pizza were fresh. Shakes were thick and smooth. It has pure taste in it. Noodles were also well cooked. It has the perfect flavor of garlic in it.. Taking about the service. The service was a litlle slow because it is a crowed place. They can't...read more"

958,"TOS has a pleasant ambience & has a lot of potential to grow into an even better restaurant. The food tasted pretty decent, nothing extraordinary though. But the order was prepared in just the right span of time and we didn't have to wait for long. Overall good job, but there's scope for improvement too!"
959,Dj is really good if dj nd dhol are not there then i defiently don't want to stay there staff is busy to checkout girls rather than listen guest order nd complain we reserve the table from dine out and we prior inform the order taker but he is least intrested in that and for his mistake we have to pay full amount where we are eligible for 50 percent discount on food and beverage so pathetic service and staff is also worst and service is extreme delayed...food is good

975,"We went there to celebrate our friends' win at a college event. Chose this place bcoz of it's rooftop sitting arrangement.1. Ambience turned out to be only good for pictures, nothing such extra ordinary.2. Food: Everything about food here was substandard except the pricing. Ridiculously small portions, and taste less. Pizza was oily AF, what did they do to it? Deep fried it may be?3. Major blow came when we refused to pay for the service charges, for one food was ridiculous and two I can choose to not pay it if I don't want to, I am legally allowed to.Guess what happens, there ohh so rude manager shows up and says if you do not pay it, we will ensure you don't step out normal. So we...read more"

I just want to say that, in addition to a nice meal, we had a delightful staff. They had just the right balance of friendliness and efficiency.

983,"They have a beautiful ambience. The terrace is beautifully done. View is great !But Food is average..quantity is veryyy less and the service is pathetically slow.If you want to order something, you have to look for staff ..specially if you have chosen a seat in shack.If you are looking for just the ambience, then you can go here ! "
984,"WORST EXPERIENCE. The service is very bad , the worker does not respond,they ignore you. the food and quantity is pathetic and plus its not worth its price. TIME AND MONEY WASTE. please never go. "
985,Pathetic service....As they are showing the deals with nearby and dineout on social media but if somebody purchase that deal and want to redeem it in the outlet they will refuse it they are not going to accept your deal so please guys don't purchase their deals ....and staff are very rude .... advice you to don't waste ur money here

988,Great ambience and amazing food. Went to this place yo party with my friends and was delighted by the service. Will definitely recommend this place .
989,The place was good however I took a deal from one of the manager. It was a ₹1200 IMFL deal Everything was going good however the manager asked for us to stop the party as we ordered 7 bottles even though it was a unlimited deal. After asking the manager for the proof that we have ordered 7 bottles he said I have got the CCTV FOOTAGE but did not show to us.Quite embarrassing in front of team. One of his staff (Waiter) was saying Sir they ordered only 3 bottles but the manager was not ready to accept and he took the remaining bottles back. It was a worst experience for us. Manager Name was Sujeet and his number was 089992 99299
990,"Restaurant denied entry stating stag entry not allowed. It is mentioned no where in description. Really disappointed. It should be mentioned in the description itself. Will never visit again, wasted my 30mins for nothing."
991,#poorservice #poorquantity and on events day without prior notice menu items are missing they are mis used the special date like demand and supply sorry and main thing after supreme court order they are taking service charges no its not gud. Sorry to say shaddy place And after booking from zomato i have to w8 with my wife for more than half hour
992,BOOKED EARLY FOR MY SPECIAL DAY BUT THE MANAGER SAYS IT'S FIRST COME FIRST SERVICE AND FOR NEXT 1 HOUR ALL BOOKINGS ARE RESERVED.I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY CONFIRM MY BOOKING.WORST EXPERIENCEDON'T GO FOR IT. THIS WAS MY FIRST AND LAST VISIT TO THIS RESTAURANT.
993,Nice ambience especially for open roof dinner . Food was good and the live guitarist made the atmosphere completely alive. Nice place for couples for romantic dinner.
994,a great place to hangout. i was there on my birthday and they make me my birthday more special with ambiance and DJ. might be will not able to roam delhi again. but if i visited and planned something to enjoy will definitely choose this place again.
995,Service is not at all goodFood is worse than all other placeThey will not hear you at the time of billingPlease dont go at this place ever they will not satisfy you in any wayThey dont take zomato goldPlease dont go
996,"The food was really bad! Be it in taste or presentation. I would recommend not to order chili paneer or peri peri pasta, you guys would end up hating the said dishes."
997,"My friend celebrated her birthday here. I have no idea if they had some issues on that day or their service is bad all the time. The nightlife floor was pretty good, their dj was great. Can’t say the same about the food and service. The food was served cold and was tasteless. We had to ask for waiters numerous times and the staff would ignore us. This place was renovated recently hopefully if i visit again I’ll have a better experience."
998,"Hi I went this place located in Punjabi bagh club road with my buddies....... I ordered kingfisher ultra, paneer pizza and coke for girls... Pizaa is ok ok.... Ambience is good but thing disappoint me is dj sound... Its so loud I mean to say no bass in speaker only too much treble..Take off scarlet please upgrade your music systemThanksDebashish "

1001,"I recently visited here with my friends and everything was so fantastic specially i like the DJ. The Dj is so awesome and ambience is also good. Food quality and quantity is enough for 2 person. I order butter chicken, steam rice, bread, brownie etc. They also have both indoor and outdoor sitting.. And everything was good."
1002,We went on Dhol night and the DJ over here is LIT😍Food is okayish except for spring rolls we din't like anything in veg.Sangria is a must try if you like wine.
1003,"TOS is one of the best club in Punjabi Bagh. Great ambiance, amazing crowd, spacious but their staff service is very slow . Food is very good specially Pizza’s and shakes. And the best part is their dj and photography."
1004,DJ is really bad and no dholl present as mentioned in on going events.Not recommended at all to anyone just a total waste of money .Food service -2Ambience -1 DJ- 0
1005,"This lounge abd bar is very nice. I kept my birthday party abd i enjoyed a lot.Those who have not visited tos, i must say u should visit this place."
1006,"Jha Bhangra ho, how could that place be bad ? Yes, it's one of the best lounge I ever visited to. Rock and roll, photography, ambience and offcourse food, all are the best. I will rate it 5/5 in Ambience and taste of food. Well, I tried honey chilli potato and Murg Malai Tikka. Both are way too yummy !! 🔥"
1007,"Tos a great lounge in punjabi bagh club road . Too spacious , great ambience , amazing crowd , cooperative staff . I tried Club Sandwich , paneer pizza , Chicken lollipops , oreo shakes , Dal makhni , paneer butter masala , chicken biryani , butter naan . Service was very fast . i must say that this outlet is really very good for parties because of their food , ambience . must try this place once ."
1008,It's my one of the best cafe and all food items of this place were excellent taste of food was amazing and the best was its ambience and services.Paneer tikka:4.7/5Chocolate shake:4/5Paneer lababdar with butter naan:4.9/5Vegetable biryani with raita:3.1/5Veg Hakka noodles with manchurian:4/5
1009,i went to this club with my friends..had a great experience.. ambience was good..services were amazing and food was delicious we had chickn and naan and chilli paneer..dj with dholl amzing combo..had grt time
1010,"Went to celebrate Halloween with friends, at this outelt must say what a beautiful place and their rooftop is just amazing loved it, completely coming to the food, we had ordered chicken 65, murgh Malai Tikka, chilli fish, chicken drumsticks, I must say that their food is really delicious and the starters tasted really amazing, then for the main course we tried mutton Rogan Josh and butter chicken and garlic naan it was lip smacking as well , to top up the entire meal we ordered their delicious walnut brownies which were hot and melted in my mouth , the ambience was great and the service was also good, surely recommended, and I would surely visit this outlet again."
1011,"Went there last week with a couple of friends. Food was average and so were the Drinks. Nothing special about the place, the decor and the furniture looks dated. The music was a bit hard on the ear. Rest was doable.You can check it out for once!!"
1012,"Take off scarlet is a lovely cafe with pretty interiors. The food here is Droolworthy. From a romantic date night to a fun filled evening with friends or a familly dinner, this place is a great option. The north Indian food here is a must try. I had paneer lababdar with butter naan And it was super delicious "
1013,"To begin with, this place has lovely ambiance. You reach there and you are in awe by the decor and beauty. The drinks here are well done and pretty nice Food too is top notch and I loved the cheesy nachos too much. Food, drinks, ambiance, vibe, music and service everything was great."
1014,"A nice lounge in Punjabi Bagh. I went there for my college fresher's and then again for to spend a normal day.Their food is good and their DJ is amazing.The roof top is pleasant in sunny winters. The place is a must visit. A perfect location for your party day.Also, please get clicked their photographer can get you some amazing pictures."
1015,"This is truly the best lounge in Punjabi Bagh. Their terrace is the main attraction according to me. The staff is also very well trained and well behaved. In food, their Tandoori Chicken pizzas is the best. "
1016,"The only thing I like about the place is personal photographer who click your random photographs while dancing. Apart of this I didn't like the food much. Everything is overpriced and also the ambience is ridiculously crowded. They claims that we levy 10% service charge & didnt serve alcohol to  age below 25 but they serves drink below 25 years, and levy 10% extra service charge which is absolutely illegal. They are just not of their words."
1017,"They served khadhai chicken instead of paneer do pyaza ordered by vegetarian friend in our group. Attitude of staff was really bad and unappologetic.Apart from this we tried spring roll, chap, chicken tandoori peri peri, mutton rara, and dal makhniOverall taste of food was good.I hope restaurant staff will be polite and careful next time."
1018,"Take off Scarlet a chilled out lounge in West Delhi's high end place with good food, a great variety of bar selection and some awesome shisha. They have an amazing rooftop. The place is for college students and young office people looking for a place to have a few drinks and maybe shake a leg.The rooftop of TOS is a perfect place when the weather is playing nice.The drinks were brilliant. We tried a few cocktails, vodka with Cranberry and a few more drinks and were not at all disappointed.Among all the other bars at Punjabi Bagh Club Road, TOS has perhaps the best infrastructure, and without any doubts, the best terrace in the area. The DJ'S song selection goes with the place's...read more"
1019,"Very Bad Service. Even i have to wait for ICE . Giving Ice in Glass with out TOMM we have to use our hand to take ice. no guy was there to take care. of the table,, have to call new person for order & he use to call other person. for the same. Sorry to say. but TOS din't accept the Gold Member Unlock Code.1st they told that YES YES we will take Zomato Gold.. after few min they told me that Our Zomato Gold System is not working. Very Disappointing with this service.. No use of have Zomato Gold."
1020,food is good but staff is not good for custmers.behaviour of staff is not like professional.........so i dont like that place due to staff.
1021,"We had Chip & Chicken, which is fried chicken with french fries, and chilly mushrooms, all taste gud, prices are reasonable, good place place to chill with friends "
1022,"One of the best place for hangout with friends, I was there with my friends last Wednesday had a good time here. We order cheese nachose and sheesha both was great."
1023,"My overall experience was Good considering a variety of factors including some Great and some not so Great (so it's a generous 4 rating) but I am sure there is a possible chance that it could be rated even 5 depending on restaurants ability to make those positive changes.Worth to mention that there are couple of floor options, one with DJ / floor (basically Dhinchak option) and other one which I personally prefer is much sober option on the open terrace with light music. They have canopies with partially covered sides separating each sitting area or you could also sit in complete open option in center too. I went on Sunday night so they had live singing which I must say I really enjoyed...read more"
1024,The staff is extremely unhostile and manager is veryy rude.Food is really bad. Won't reccomend anyone to visit such place. Will spoil your mood and day.Will surely not repeat this mistake in my life..
1025,Worst place i have ever been to. Never visit the place until you are in the mood to spoil your day. No courtesy of how to talk and behave with their customers.
1026,"I visited this place with my boyfriend, it was my first dating experience and i really had an amazing time with him here, we both had a kutual decision to visit this place. We enjoyed our food with a beer and some Amazing beats. "
1027,"Take off scarlet is a authentic bar and clubbing property in west delhi, visited here for many a times and have been finding it a good place to be visited with friends and family for a good party time. I like the seating arrangement and dance area management and also the food service was way too quick."
1028,"No doubt this place is very beautiful for winter evenings, they even provide blanket and big bowl of coal which is like cherry on the cake. Coming to their food, it's good specially butter chicken fries but one thing which needs to be checked is the quality of chicken!"
1029,A nice place to go out with friends if you enjoy loud music. They have a nice ambience and great service. We ordered baked nachos and white sauce pasta. The pasta was pretty good. They bread with the pasta was beautifully cooked and crisp. 
1030,"This place is amazing you can have a great fun here. The staff is very polite,active and friendly. It is great place to party with friends. The food is also good"
1031,I find tos as a good place to enjoy late night party as it is really good place the dj in house is really amazing idk how he guesses the mood and plays the best tracks and even the food and cocktail fusions were really amazing too...
1032,"Take if Scarlet in punjabi bagh is a good place for enjoying some good bites with a really dj in house, i went here with my friends to celebrate an occasion and me and my friends were highly satisfied with everything."
1033,"Tos is a good clubbing cafe outlet in Punjabi bagh, visited here with my friends for birthday bash and really enjoyed alot the bar and dj in the house were really amazing too.... "
1034,"It's a place for party lovers. It has 2 floors, the lower one has dim lighting & indoor seating and the upper one has rooftop seating.If you're going with bunch of people then check out their party packages. They have plenty of different packages that includes alcohol and that too at very genuine prices.AMBIENCE: The interiors are good. Music was very loud as it's a party place. It's no place for decent conversations.FOOD: I ordered loaded chicken nachos(crispy and served with sauces and shredded chicken on top), arrabbiata penne pasta(sauce was perfectly fine with cooked veggies like zucchini, broccoli & mushrooms), paneer tikka pizza(thin crust), bruschetta( soft garlic bread with...read more"
1035,Take off Scarlet or TOS is a nice place to hang out. TOS is spread over two floors. One floor is for indoor seating and other floor has beautiful terrace sitting. Coming on food I tried1. All Veg Pizza 5/52. Corn N Pepper 4/53. Dahi ke kebab 4/54. Manchurian 4/55. Spring rolls 3/56. Paneer Tikka 2/57. White Sauce Pasta 2/5Overall food was good and service was also fast. 
1036,"Ambience was good dj was good but food was not upto that mark very costly and the quantity was also very less and also the service was also not good, waiters were in so hurry to run that they were not properly listening what we want "
1037,I went there with my friends and we chose to sit on Rooftop Seating... The ambience was good... Service was also fine.. But the food was very average...Was very disappointed with the taste of the food. 
1038,Me and my friend wanted to chill on a Friday early evening and the place was packed at around 5 too but we got a table :) the dance floor was full with people. The music was nice.  There indoor seating has very cozy feel with dim lighting. And rooftop is really nice too. We ordered falafel pita pocket and pizza. Both the things were okay! Service was slow. Had to look for the server few minutes before ordering.
1039,"visited this place many times ,it is an amazing place to hangout, food (specially loaded nachos )is awesome and ambience is great, music and dhol played there is really nice."
1040,"Been here once, and we have been told they do not have any wine, the only option in beer was given is Budweiser even having to prolong list of beer mentioned in their menu and been denied again that they don't even have breezer.Food wasn't that great as well.Wouldnt recommends anyone to go to this place......"
1041,"Probably my favourite place to visit because of their food, their dj, their rooftop in short everything! Have tried their whole menu and everything was so perfect! Also celebrated my birthday over there! A great thumbs up for this place in every aspect!"
1042,Tos in punjabi bagh is a really good club n bar to enjoy your food with dance. I really enjoyed my time here with my friends celebrating my bday bash. The food was really good and staff was also very cooperative. 
1043,i went to take off scarlet with ny friends. i had too much fun their with my friends. the music was amazing plus the food is mouthwatering. will surely visit again.
1044,#TakeOffScarletAmbience is too good as well as food.I ordered Tofu Burger the taste was awesome. Then I ordered Chicken Pita Pocket it was yumm.In Drinks I ordered Oreo shake it was great and had a nice experience surly going to recommend this place ...Great service keep it up :)
1045,"Had been there with my friends some days ago. TOS has two types of seatings, lower floor has dim light and another one is rooftop seating.Ambience was nice.Ordered breezers, Vodka, pasta, chilli potato, Biryani. Pasta and chilli potatoes were okayish but portion was very less according to their prices. Biryani was the savior, nice in taste and portion was good.We ordered two glasses of vodka and they didnt even served them in vodka glasses they served them in water glasses.Giving 3 stars only because i enjoyed dance there,Otherwise 2.5/5.Little bit costly according to their taste and portions."
1046,Service and food not up to par...Staff is arrogant and not listening to customers Humble request to the management to look into the issue. Drinks served in plastic glasses is not acceptable Food quality is so so But yeh i di like the pita pockets they served and peanut masala.Overall I would request the management to look into these small issue and work on improving serviceI ll soon be coming again for another review and hoping to change my review to 5 star... 
1047,Worst worst worst experience. Crowd was not good and they don't even corporate with us. Will not go again in my whole life. fights were going their. People were pushing each their in a very bad manner.
1048,Horrible experience here at this place. Absolutely pathetic management and rude staff. We were 4 people who went to this place for lunch. We were refused the open terrace seating and were made to wait for an hour to get a table even when the entire place was empty. The service was super slow. The food was stale and pathetic quality. More over they try to trick you by inflating your bill. I had to call the manager to get it sorted. Also they try to hide their inefficient performance by getting zomato reviews deleted from their profile. All my friends put a negative review and they got it removed. This is me posting for the second time so that people should be aware of how pathetic and...read more
1049,"We visited this place on 30th of december with high hopes after seeing the reviews. But, boy we were so wrong. The place was heavily crowded actually too crowded for them to handle. We had already spoken to the person concerned to book our table as we knew the place is gonna be crowded due to 31st coming up but still we had to struggle for our table there. We spoke to 2 managers there to get a table and each one was giving us new excuses regarding the table issue. We got our table after atleast 45 mins of struggle and the table was next to the DJ in a dingy corner across the dance floor where no waiter could provide us service. We could not even talk among ourselves plus the table was too...read more"
1050,"Not a good experience to say the least. Worst service possible. The staff could not even arrange a table for us even though we had called the restaurant twice to reserve a table for us, and had to wait for almost 45 minutes after getting there. And they were not even apologetic. Far from it actually. And to top it all off, they deliberately tampered with our bill in the hopes that we would not notice that they were charging us more than the price listed on their menu.You can see from the photo that they charged us Rs. 344 for absolute vodka shots whereas from their menu given here on Zomato itself, you can cross-check that they are priced at Rs. 195. Wow, As if we are blind and would not...read more"
1051,Not upto mark. Do not fall for high ratings. Their service is pathetic. We ordered pasta which they didn't delivered. Do not pay service charge if you don't feel satisfied. 
1052,"This place has an amazing ambience and service to offer. The staff was polite, the crowd was nice, the food was good and even the DJ was pretty amazing. "
1053,This lounge has both the closed as well as open cafe.. the view on the terrace is amazing.. the lounge also has a dance floor for full party enjoymnt.. we ordered drinks and white sauce pasta it was yumm...But the pizza was not that tasty..
1054,Amazing dj and awesome food be it starters or main course nice ambience with a friendly staff also the services are quite good best place for the youngsters 
1055,"Take off scarlet Went there for the first time with friends- Worst service, very bad experience   Order Kuch karo serve Kuch Aur kar dete hai . Spoiled my birthday party  😡 "
1056,I have been many lounges in punjabi bagh never had this kind of experience..1. On the new year eve they are serving the cold pasta and when i told them that this kind of food they are so i will not pay and the manager said this kind of food is served to every one if i am running a lounge this kind of food will nit be served2. I have to ask again and again for the hooka coal and also not even one hooka was perfect some time there is water in pipe sometime the pipe is cut3. When i had my snacks and and said someone to change the coal the staff took it and didnt bring backThis was the worst experience i ever hadI will never recommend any one to go to that lounge
1057,"Yesterday I visit take off scarlet which is located near west punjabi bagh metro station. I visit there to celebrate my birthday. But, the service was so so worst. I ordered oreo shake and kitkat shake and after waiting for 15 minutes they serve us strawberry 🍓 shake. That was so irritating. Atleast they should asked once or Atleast inform us. Then we decide to order brownie shake then they come after 5 minutes and said there is only strawberry shake. Then we leave that place so annoying people and worst service "
1058,Atmosphere was awesome..... Service was to good nd taste of DAHI KABAB is also good i just love it ... Its nyc place to chill out with your frnds ......
1059,worst svc everfirstly the person on the entry named GAURAV was very rude. because i ws a nearbuy cust they treated me like shitit was my prebday evethe portion of the food provided was very lessthe staff was literally unprofessionalThey did not knw how to speak and deal with the customersI WOULD NOT SUGGEST THIS PLACE TO ANYONEGUYS IF U WANT TO RUIN UR EVENING THEN YOU CAN VISIT THE PLACE 
1060,Worst service ever. No one comes and takes the order. They probably expect the customer to reach out to them for placing the order. Had the worst experience ever. Would have liked to give it a zero rating but since that isn’t allowed I’ll go with 1.
1061,A very nice place to be visited with friends.Good qualities of TOS is :Loud bollywood musicYummy foodStaff serviceDance floor is really goodTheir services was quick and the food served was of good tasteTake Off Scarlet 
1062,#partyplace #TOSGUYS i am glad yo share my experience with you at TAKE OF SCARLET. I visited the place with my few mates and we had a great fun here. The staff was humble and nice. Ambience is also very nice. This place also provides exciting offers and discounts.__________________________________What we ordered:-1. Farmhouse pizza 5/52. Virgin mojito 4/53. Malai chaap 3/54. Murg malai tikka 4/5__________________________________Thus place is full. Of excitement and fun. Overall experience is nice. This place is worth spending money. 
1063,Guys ..never ever go to this place on new year eve...last year it spoil all our excitement ...it was pathetic inside no food nothing ....over crowd..better to go anywhere else...there is nothing like that unliimited food n all...
1064,Food is. Good and sarvers are also so good. Awesome ambience and music. definitely recommend this place to all of my friends. Great service and great place.
1065,The food is average and isnt served well and The staff service is extremely slow and ignorant though the DJ is definitely a mood changer after all the bad service! 
1066,I like ambience tos was bast Pleac for party I eat there chicken malai tikka was nice and chicken pizza also I drink there black label and music is nice here 
1067,"Believe all the great reviews. This place is the real deal!! Fantastic welcome & food by people that really care about giving you an authentic taste of India. Lovely staff, lovely food. Thank you so much for making our evening very special - it was faultless."
1068,"This is patheticnplace to visit...POOR SERVICE, POOR STAFF, uneducated manager Gaurav, who don't know how to deal with customers. They people think that they are running the best lace but trust me their food quality is even worse from street foods we get. We visited there with 8 people and they were not having sufficient resources to entertain us. Poor manager who don't know how to talk even. He talking rudely with us on wrong bill being charged to us and inspite it was their mistake nthey people created wrong bill just coz it's Christmas. Guys places like this should be shut down "
1069,"Worst place, service and staff is even more worst.... I went to TOS hearing lot about this place but was extremely disappointed, staff have their own attitude and were serving food after one hour of ordering..... They don’t know how to manage so many people and Staff were so rude and were not ready to listen at all.NO VALUE FOR MONEY!!"
1070,Very bad place poor service attitude of waiters and managers also very arrogant. Never go to this place they don’t know how to manage people and food is so bad. Poor experience 👎👎👎👎👎👎
1071,Very bad service . And the food was also not up to the mark. The staff was also not polite to us . I didn't like this place . We didn't expect this from such a good place 
1072,"Heard alot n found the atmosphere best but were really very disappointed by the service the staff was not cooperative at all we were 6 people's and we didn't got the place n really we're not happy the music was lit but they food was not good n service was also very slow we then booked a table on zomato but that was not helpful as they said ""sir table is for people who have not entered yet you must go n then come but we can't promise n we will cancel the booking if the table is not free"" this was really disappointing really very much it was my friends birthday so we cut the cake ordered some food that was not good we drank our Heineken and left n went to toranda which was next to...read more"
1073,Service is worstNo proper management is there👎👎❌In starting half an hour there was no one to take orderFood was fine but after telling them to serve water 4 times still they didn't listen worst part was that they were not listening which is very annoyingBut when It came to give money they were present in 1 min only. 
1074,"Worst Service ever! As soon as we took our seat, they quickly took our order yet kept waiting for an hour for serving the food. The quality of food was very bad. When we asked them to call for the manager, they kept us waiting for more than an hour, and even then no action was taken. The staff was so rude. Would not recommend the place to anyone. "
1075,This place comes under the over-popular and over-hyped about places in Punjabi Bagh. I have visited this place many times and but have been disappointed this time. I visited this place whenever I wanted to party or just wanted to spend some quality time with friends.But in recent time I have been disappointed whenever I have visited this place the place has reduced their quality of food and reduced their quality of service drastically we waited more than an hour for our food to arrive and the staff was very rude.This place is not worth a visit try other places which are far better in service and food quality than this place 
1076,"Management is very lousy. They take a lot of time to respond and fulfill the orders and requests. Food was okay , like any other restaurant. Overall a bad experience . "
1077,Pathetic service! Pathetic food! I ordered tandoori chicken pizza and this is what it came. An insect dead. Worst service! So disgusted by their customer friendliness.
1078,"Coming to Punjabi Bagh Club Road , This Place js One of the most Buzziest Popular and Happening .BE IT ANYTHING SERVICE AMBIENCE MUSIC DECOR FOOD .

1079,"Great lounge to party with your squad, great food and staff. Must visit place to chill your mood. Ambience is really nice, worth going place. everything is perfect. "
1080,t was beautiful-peaceful and relaxing. Staff was outstanding. The restaurant was exceptional along with the hosts and servers. Amazing nights ☺️
1081,"After a day of traveling our family just wanted some good food, different taste and walking distance: We did just that! From our Home it was about a 10-15 minute walk and happened to land upon this beautiful gem. It is upstairs overlooking the city streets. First impression to the very last bite we took was nothing short of character. The food and service was above expectations! Make sure to order every course as they will not disappoint your taste buds."
1082,"This unassuming restaurant is Indian cuisine at its very best. Offering a fantastic range of dishes, the taste and flavors are just stunning. Very reasonably priced and providing excellent hospitality we will definitely return to this wonderful restaurant. Not to be missed. Thank you."
1083,"We went to this place today as all reviews mention the staff is rude. We ordered pasta,pizza and oreo shake. The quantity of pasta was not even enough for one person, secondly after taking the order 20 mins later the restaurant told that pizza was unavailable and the oreo shake was worse than what one can prepare at home by just blending milk and oreo together. If you are looking for good food this place is surely not for you."
1084,"Ambiance is little more dark, we enjoyed terrace sitting more with cubical type area. Food is above average. We ordered Chicken Tikka and Chicken Tandoori pizza .. both were good but nothing special ..Price is reasonable.One visit is must...."
1085,"Its an amazing place😍It also has a rooftop also. They also provided bornfire kind off for each table , it was so amazing to cope up with cold weather. I ordered BBQ chicken pizza , it was so yummy with lots of chicken pieces nd loaded with cheese. And also ordered chicken drumstick , it was also good but pizza was amazing than this. I also ordered one of the mocktails , but didnt liked that much , it was not so good not so bad. But everything was good and nice.Service was on time nd was friendly. Best time to spend their with family or also with friends. "
1086,"my friend love this restaurant and took us here for a meal. The food was fantastic, I had lamb. the meat was so tender. The staff are very friendly and service excellent. Will defo be returning."
1087,"I don't often make remarks, but the meal I had tonight was at another level. Full of flavour, well presented. The place was full which speaks volumes. Superb!"
1088,Excellent food and staff are amazing and right at Punjabi Bagh every time we visit without a booking they always accommodate us well. Food n drinks were fabulous though worth a visit.
1089,"My partner and I were in the area and as we both enjoy Indian food we decided to come here after seeing the positive reviews online, really glad we did as the quality was amazing. It was a fairly good restaurant but had a lovely atmosphere and had decorated which was a brilliant touch. Despite the restaurant being full the food arrived very quickly, the veg was fresh and it tasted really good quality, the portions were perfect although the naan breads are massive so you may only need one between two. Overall a lovely night and we will be back when we're next in the area!"
1090,Went last night for the first time and very impressed. The menu was a bit confusing with portion sizes- but the waiter was excellent and advised us all on what to have. Would definitely go back.
1091,"Ambience food service. All things are superb.Courteous staff, fast service ,live music and tasty food, mojito is awesome In lite drinks and lababdar is too yummy."
1092,"After booking this restaurant using their extremely easy to use website, we were excited to be going, and on arriving we were not disappointing! The staff were very friendly and explained the menu to us, we were somewhat confused as this was our first visit! It certainly wont be our last, the food was delicious, and bore only the vaguest resemblance to the ""indian"" food. It was not in the slightest bit greasy and was spicy without being overpowering, (i cant say what it was I had because I have no idea how to spell it, but basically it was a north Indian chicken) the chicken was tender and the whole meal was delicious, Recommended! A+++"
1093,"Talking about the food we ordered a Chicken Tikka, Chicken Tandoori Pizza and a Beer bucket. The chicken tikka had a really good taste but there wasn’t anything special About it, as it had that long old taste to it which was sort of okay but not upto the mark. "
1094,I came here with a friend for a change and not knowing what to expect. The decor inside is nice and the service is excellent. The staff are helpful in recommendations and the food was excellent. I have been back many times since and have yet to be disappointed. The drinks prices were also very reasonable.
1095,Apart from the crowd there isn't much to talk about regarding this place. The drinks are priced fine but the food is not at all up to the mark. Plus the crowd can get excess of the capacity of the club
1096,"Went along for a meal (pre fixed menu, a la carte with some discount) with a friend and what can I say... The menu was well laid out with authentic dishes not just the typical fair we come to expect. Decor was pleasing on the eye with hard wood flooring and walls, with large pictures depicting Indian culture. Service was quick, efficient and friendly. The food was simply one of the best Indians I've had and one of the best meals I've had in the past few years. Not the cheapest but far from extortionate, and after the pre  discount it was quite reasonable. Overall very satisfied and will definitely go back."
1097,"I was part of a large group and we really enjoyed our visit. It is a large menu and when our order was taken the waiter didn't take a note of our order and we all got what we ordered without him having to ask who was having what, which was quite impressive. We booked as part of the 5pm deal and when we got our bill it had not been discounted but when we said it was sorted straight away. Really good, would definitely go back."
1098,"Fantastic Experience. Great food, great service and not too expensive. Would definately go here again. 5 of us turned up and even though they were busy within 5 minutes had moved some tables to get us in. Couple not used to Northern Indian food so the waiter spent some time explaining many of the dishes, and what choice. Free accomplishment included in the meal.All in all great meal, good value but not at the cheap end of the market.  Bucks for Bucks though worth every penny."
1099,"The staff work hard and are very pleasant. Food is very very good, only critical thing I would say is the portion sizes are little less. I ordered a main lamb dish and also a daal with it, I ate both easily. Main meal size is what you would expect at lunch. Drinks were fabulous and ambience was good. Overall a good place in Punjabi Bagh."
1100,"This is, by far, the best Indian restaurant I have ever eaten in. Many, many times. The selection is out of the ordinary and expertly cooked. The staff are knowledgeable. Frequently we rely on their recommendations rather than choosing from their (extensive) menu. AND, it's not too expensive."
1101,"Nice place to chill. Booking a table in advance is better because everytime i go there its always packed and even if its not they take a hell lot of time to get you a table . Dj and food is fine , had a good time . 😁"
1102,Best place for party lovers..I visited the same for one of my friend’s birthday party and guess what it was the Dhol night ❣️ Ambiance & music is really good but service could be much better
1103,"Went to TOS a few days back, the place was so crowded that we got a table almost after 10-15 minutes of entering. The dj was too loud. The food was okay, we ordered pizza and chicken tikka. Both the items werent too amazing. Pizza had very less cheese and it was very dry. Chicken tikka was too watery, you ll be able to figure out in the pictures as well. I wanted to order one cocktail but it wasnt available. The steward suggested us to stick to the straight drinks only. So we just thought of obeying him. Overall a decent experience! Nothing so wow! "

1106,Place is good. Nice ambience. Food was okay. Not so great. Very poor serving. Waiter behaviour was not good at all. I don't know how it is rated 4.4 on Zomato. 
1107,Take off scarlet is one of the best lounges in Punjabi Bagh. It lives up to all the hype it has created. It's a perfect place for youngsters as it has a dance floor and plays loud music. They serve various kinds of dishes ranging from continental to indian. I loved their non veg lebanese platter. I wish TOS team all the success in the future too!
1108,"This is my second visit here..lovely place with lovely ambience and real nice food. But my opinion changed on my second visit.lounges like headquarters ,mrp etc allows two people to dine in but i visited it twice with a friend but they didnt let us in just telling they allow a couple or five persons in a group which disappointed me a lot as i visited it with two of my friend on my first visit. U might be gaining costumers but ur loosin ur regular one.good luck"
1109,"TOS is a happening club in punjabi bagh. I visited TOS yesterday with my friends for dinner. It's a spacious lounge as the place has indoor as well as terrace sitting. The decor is beautiful on both the floors. Its a Multicuisine lounge, so we ordered their specials:Veg sharing platter &Non veg sharing platter. Both were awesome in presentation n taste. We also tried their stuffed mushrooms which were perfect in taste. In shakes we tried their berry shake and kitkat chocolate shake. The berry shake was awesome and I personally recommend it to everyone.Moving to dessert we ordered brownie with vanilla ice cream which was icing on the cake.Had a great experience. Will definitely visit...read more"
1110,Yesterday night was our wedding anniversary.we choose TOS as a venue but we’re very disappointed by the staff service and bar .They were not having even regular brands of liquor and had arranged after an hour from nearby pub AIR .couldn’t recommend it to anyone 
1111,Food is just fine. Dj is weirdly loud even for foot steppers like us.blunt fusions of songs and stops suddenly at 12 without a take off note.overall just an ok experience thrice we gave it a chance. Could be better for big groups n families may be.
1112,"Well... What's the first thing that comes to your mind when you are in a mood to plan your birthday party...?🎂🎉That's! Dance, food and friends...Well bringing friends along is your part!

I don't know if u think the same... 🙄We had a party over there... And I must say it didn't gave us a party feeling...

1113,So I went to TOS on November 30 with my friends to celebrate my birthday but the service wasn't upto that mark and the quantity of food was also very limited the guy who attended us was giving us low-key attidude I don't know why. We also requested for a dj as it was 8 in the evening they said only couple are allowed for the dj. Idk what kinda rules and policies they have if they cannot satisfy their customers.
1114,It is the place where i used to go most of the times when im in punjabi bagh ambience is too good and food is delciousMust try things are :Chicken malai tikkaNachos with dipsElectric lemonadeAndSheehsa is must thing ❤
1115,place and ambience is good but the staff service was very bad starting half n hr no one comes to take order. the waiter behaviour was not appropriate. the food was ok. Anmol Singh 
1116,"I booked a table for my Birthday celebration.Well it was my best experience at a nominal cost for a gathering of 10 people.The staff, the ambience, the food and DJ all was just awesome.TOS is my favourite lounge in Punjabi bagh.Food- 3.5/5Ambeince - 4/5DJ - 4/5Staff - 4/5"
1117,"So yesterday I went to this cafe ""Take off scarlet "" located in punjabi bagh club road and found very amazing and attractive. The crowd was really amazing. The ambience was impressive. In starters we had some french fries , paneer pepi pizza , murgh malai tikka , manchurian , tandoori chiken , oreo shakes , vanilla ice-cream  with hot brownie . Services were also fast and quick. I would  absolutely recommed everyone to try this place once. Looking forward to visit them soon again. Had a great experience. "
1118,One of the best lounge in Panjabi bagh!It has beautiful decor so you can click photos there!Ambience was good.... Best party place with friends as Dj available !Coming to food .. taste nice! But quantity was less according to the price if the dish!

Haha.- I had to drag the manager to get us a table despite our pre-booking (unlike what generally happens).- I had to to be precise get up and call the waiter thrice before anyone came with menus with half the pages.- Table didn't get clean and we had to just let it be.- The pasta came (second thing good about it). And forks came in after 10 minutes. That too when I got up for the fourth time to get serviced.- Oh the plates never came, just FYI.- Manager had balls enough to charge 10% service charge above this shitty service and deny to remove it despite it not being legal.Probably if it were some other day, they would...read more"
1122,"Great place to be at. I ordered chilly chicken, chilly garlic chowmein, pasta, 2 beers and a hookah. The food was great, with just the right amount of spices and sauces. The terrace here has an amazing atmosphere with a great crowd and aura. Amazing lighting and soothing music. Great place to be at. Also, the waiters are amazing, friendly and actually helpful. Though the hookah was taken away because of some reasons, the offered to bring it back after the problem got solved. Must go place in Punjabi Bagh. Though it’s a bit costly, but it is totally worth it."
1123,"A good place ...with perfect decor and serviceThe food is quiet good ...........Ambiance ,variety of food everything is very nice but the best part according to me is DJ "
1124,"Food served is average prices are a bit on higher side but the main drawback is the service,it is too slow they took around 1:30 hr to bring the starters which was very disappointing"
1125,"We went to Take Off Scarlet for a friend's birthday celebration. The ambience and DJ is superb. We couldn't stop doing all crazy moves. We ordered proper main course, shahi paneer and butter chicken, which I think was good. They also have a personal photographer who clicked few amazing pictures. 🙈"
1126,Very poor service. It took them around 3 hrs give us our fkin food. The place isn't spacious at all. Ambience was OK. But the place was dirty. 
1127,"Take of Scarlet is one of the top lounge located in Punjabi bagh .The ambience is also very good .We started with their mocktails- Virgin Mojito and chocolate shakes which was very refreshing and well prepared .After that we tried Loaded chicken Nacho's, Dal Makhni shots, chilly panner, Loaded Nacho's , Mushroom cheesy melted .After trying various cuisines I can say that the quality and quantity of the food is remarkable .The staff of the TOS is also very helpful and supportive."
1128,"A perfect diner with mesmerizing decor that absorbs all your attention. They have a wide variety of coolers, shakes and mocktails. I ordered ""brownie shake"" which had a great taste I have ever had. The food is very delicious, it is like getting happiness all at once. Around 5-6 different varieties in every dish and if you are craving for mouth watering tandoori and Tikka recipes, this is the place to dine in.

1143,They charge a 10% service charge which they’ll not at all remove.They have placed only a single board which is not at all visible.And if you’ll book through dineout they’ll never remove that charge.They can fight with you till the end but will not remove the charge.Food is average and the quantity is very less.Overall experience average.Will suggest this place only if you want to enjoy open terrace.

And normally snack are served on table to guest but they made it a ceremony and arranged a system where snack are put in a trolley like marriages .They overbooked there place more than the capacity and hence the service and arrangement were poor."

1183,"Service was slow af, that maybe due to crowd and overbookings. But the staff behaviour was totally untolerable. We had a quarrel one of their staff inappropriately touched few of my female mates not once but thrice . Once it maybe by mistake but he was smilimg with his fellow workers staring at us. The management was just trying to suppress the issue instead of resolving. I didnt called police just because it was getting late and my female friends had to head home by time. Food was okay dj was good but if these things happen with cuatomers its totally unacceptable. It happened today 31st october 2018 wednesday."
1184,"It was a fine day, was feeling hungry so we entered just like that to see, as we had heard a lott about them.We entered the ambience of the place was great, but to be honest the dhol with dj was just not up to the mark! Dhol player was roaming here and there totally out of the sync of music and playing.Lest, we ordered our food, i ordered a Mutton Seekh kabab, chilly chicken, with some drinks. Seekh kabab were fresh and amazing! They tasted really great. Just like you put it in your mouth and it starts melting. Chilly chicken was good either. Over all it was a great experience going there shall visit pretty soon. "

Youngsters, being the majority crowd, can be seen dancing crazy. Coming to the food, this is perhaps one of the places that have every item  to be equally tasting good. We tried the alfredo pasta, fresh lime soda, dal makhani, paneer do pyaza, chef’s special paneer tikka, etc. and found every single item to be equally good.

DJ is just awesome and you'll love their food, i ordered honey chilly potato, spring roll , Alfredo pasta, shakes, they were all so tasty. Decor is so nice and terrace is also very peaceful with live singing going on there. So one must visit here. "
1317,"Ambience - 4Service - 1Food - 2.5I heard a lot about this place and planned my birthday here. The experience was not very bad but the restaurant service was below average, the waiters did not respond and when I got my bill they added 12 items instead of 6. The food was alright, the chicken was not well cooked and the noodles were okayish. The pasta and chilli potato were highly average as well. I don't understand the hype about this place and why is it so packed with people all the time. However, if you're just looking to dance, have drinks and chill, a one time visit is good."
1318,"Spoilt for choice as a friend was throwing a party we chose a new place. Their must have starters are Fish Tikka , crispy fish , chef special chicken wings , chicken gilafi kebab, all were garnished well with the correct condiments given along.Main course few of my friends opted for a chicken & cheese burger whereas I ordered paneer do pyaza with assorted bread basket. They added the freshest quality of paneer because it was super soft.Loved their fish preparation as it could clearly be seen that it's one of their USP's , the chicken wings were way to tiny but like small flavourful bombs. (Tangy and spicy)Tasted the chicken and cheese burger which was grilled to perfection with melting...read more"

1337,Rude StaffDirty place - cockroaches were seen near the tableLights were not working ( our table had an inbuilt light which was not working)This is the condition of menu they hand us ( some shitty sauce was stuck on one of the pages)Won't recommend at all
1338,"Actually it does not even deserve a single star . The place is horrible , not at all clean , stinks , half of their lights are not working . The staff is rude . The tables and the floor were not at all clean . I have uploaded the condition of their menu card . I will not recommend this place . "
1339,Not a place i would recommend any one. The staff was very rude as if they are forced to work. They were not at all polite and helpful.Pathetic food and not even a bit close to hygiene. The sofas were torn and burnt. There were cockroaches all around. The place was stinking 
1340,a great place for dance lovers...jam packed almost all time....just the ambience was great...!!.food was average and SERVICE WAS WORST EVER..I ORDERED-.white sauce pasta- tasted average...not very flavourful but not bad.fried corn veggies-tasted good cz fried food is always good(probablt the best in the lot).onion rings- ok again because fried...buit can have better onion rings at tons of places...not properly seasoned.mushroom garlic bread thingy- tasted ok just normal bread and cheese.paneer tikka pizza-tasted bad as crust was burnt and peppers and onion toppings seemed raw.veggie pizza- same rawness in veggies.WORST WERE BEVREGES- mojito tasted like just lime and...read more
1341,"We went to this place when one of our friend came to meet us after a long time the ambience was quite nice and more than what we expected. The place was really crowded but the experience was really nice service is delayed because of crowd but this thing worth it. The dj was playing really nice songs to create the ambience that was really cool. The food was really good we ordered pizza, mix sauce pasta, nachos and chilly garlic noodles they are really nice. Overall experience was really nice it's a must recommend place to visit when you are feeling tried or meeting old friends because it's a nice place to chill around."
1342,Great place to party with good ambience and music but the thing which disappointed was the food and service.Even if the cafe is full one should have enough staff to serve at time and cook properly not just giving doing hurry and completing the order without even heating.Ordered peri peri chicken grill sandwich n what i got was not even hot grilling is something out of there syllabus i think.Dahi kebab were so sweet.They were having pizza at rs21 it was customised and small but still doable but the sandwich was just shitt.Drinks were good.Ambience-5/5Crowd-5/5Music-5/5Food-1/5Service-1/5
1343,TOSI am so disappointed from this placeFood was really good but the service was very slow and the attitude of the staff towards there customers is really disrespectful The worst dish was cheesy nachos and when we asked them to change it they took almost half an hour for that 
1344,"One of the best places on club road,punjabi bagh and you can enjoy time with friends.😎drinks and food are good and you can have good time there😍"
1345,"Well it was nice to be at take off scarlet ! Ambience is good . Dj decor is good . But few things were not at all appreciable which i must quote for the improvement, serving staff is quite lethargic . Moreover i must tell you that look after your bill cuz they manipulate it much . What happened was, i ordered  4 drinks and they charged for 6 and when i asked them to rectify they argued . But after few min they amended it and charged for 4 . This shows they are making abrupt manipulation and is trying to mint money by such acts . Such things create a bad impressions so would recommend to rectify the same :) "
1346,"Had the worst experience here last night.i usually don’t write reviews but this one was exceptional.there food is average, nachos were soggy n onions were stinking. Their chilly chicken was extremely spicy.they don’t have 6 beers out of 8 options, they took 30 minutes to prepare a simple cocktail. We ordered hukka around 11 p.m,at 11.30 p.m we told them to cancel it cuz at 12 they close but still at 11.40  they served hukka n it flavour got burnt in 15-20 mins n then we requested them to change the hukka but they declined cuz by 12 they wind up their hukka flavours n coal. After such a bad experience,we decided we won’t pay service charge as their service was worst, but their staff...read more"
1347,The place was very good.. I enjoyed my eveningAmbience was very goodFood was amazingCroud was good and in my time i had only watch couple that was good there is no any stageServices are bad 4 out of 10My experience was goodTAKE OF SACRLET highly recommend 
1348,This is wrost experience of my life they manager don't know how to talk with a girl and they don't ask me your booking or not he says directly don't have space and he talk badly with my fionsay like cheap word using aunty such big loooser behanchod sala...
1349,Probably the worst place for anything and everything. Extremely poor service with delays for around 15 minutes for a bottle of water. The staff was really rude and the worst part was the frequent power cuts. They didn't have power back up for most part of the time and we ended up having to eat with flashlights on. The AC was faulty and no one was around from whom we could inquire. One could yell all they want but the waiters won't listen over the sound of music.Worst Experience Ever.
1350,Nothing is good.....no service no staff no management no crockery... waiter said glass nahi hai sir toot gaye....i dont recommend anybody to waste your time here....
1351,TOS!!  One of the worst experience i had today! I went there today.Service - 0.5/5 Ambience- 3.5/5Food - 1/5 Staff - 0/5First of all everything i had there today was really unexpected! VERY SLOW SERVICE! They don’t know how to deal their customers. Very disrespectful! Staff attitude towards Customers = YUKK ! They served us Virgin mojito in plastic glasses! Like seriously? IS THIS YOUR STANDARD? Unexpected! Nachos dip was like picked up from some other customer’s table! I won’t recommend this one at all! 
1352,"I will start my review with a little tip: NEVER try this one out.• The food had no taste and pathetic presentation, I had to wait for roughly 10-15 mins just for the water bottle.•They were so short on their manpower that you need 5-10 minutes to get attended.•Servers on a dhaba are better trained, knowledgeable and courteous than staff here.•Dip with the nachos was so less and splattered as if it was ""ort"" or used already.•We were first told that manager is not on duty and when we burst out of anger than the illiterate manager came down with no solution to any of the problems.•The lounge served us the mocktails in plastic ""thele wale glasses""• I wish I could...read more"
1353,"I have heard about this place a hell lot, so i was very curious to visit but my first experience turned out to be hell... there was power cut for about 10-15 times.. have u ever heard any lounge having this much trouble also DJ was not on time we waited for 2 hrs for DJ .. not going there ever again worst place ever. Poor 👎🏻"
1354,Very Pathetic service... i will not recommend anyone to go there.. never had such bad experience.. We asked for water and they served it in plastic glasses that too when we get up to leave... overall a bad experience.. 
1355,Not good manager didn't change our sitting you can see their are many vacant seats and very loud music. Should be more support. I will visit again and see......
1356,This place was so good and best moments to spend time with best buddy ☺️☺️☺️☺️ Always try new place and best food to reduce stress and make day happy 😍😍😍
1357,"Saturday I visited tos with my family, at the time of bill payment your team added extra food in my bill like Lahori mutton seekh and garlic murg tikka, after few min struggle these two items removed from my bill.After leaving this place, I was checking bill again and found there is one more item SPL699 is added in my bill, as far as I remember none of us order this but still it is present in my bill.I want to know what is this spl699 which is added on my bill.For same issue I wrote you mail, sent Facebook message you read my issue message but still not able to resolve it.I will suggest not to visit."
1358,"Recent offer by Toss ,pizza at Rs.21 is totally a over smart way to attract customer. We got pizza after 1hr delay after ordering our other dishes and too just 6inch thin crust after giving 4 reminders.Guys don't go there ,they have poor service.Live singing and DJ was nice,we enjoyed that way."
1359,"Went to TOS for my friends birthday party!To my surprise, it was way more than I expected.I totally loved everything about it.Many a times people couldnt go out at night to enjoy delhi’s actual night life, but this place will make you experience the same in day time aswell!So well organized DJ and dhol after 3pm.The service was a bit slow but it was fully crowded with people even of a weekday (do make reservations before)Coming to the food and drinks,They had really less variety of brands in alcohol.I hadPizza - yumMix sauce pasta - deliciousNachos - averageChilly garlic noodles - yumOverall experienceService -4/5Vibes - 6/5 😋Food - 5/5Ambience - 5/5Value for...read more"
1360,"Wanted to try out a new outlet and this came across as a nice choice. Open air , serves great food .. was greeted warmly by the manager. Overall a great experience, when we went at 9 pm we were the first ones to enter however people started coming in and place became happening. Great deals on beer buckets and decent pricing is the key and they really dont need Zomato Gold to attract business. Great offers for corporate parties as well which i will be using soon to get my hotel team here for a good time. Great going and keep it up. "
1361,"TOS is located in club road, punjabi bagh and is a perfect party place. Here is my review:Ambience: Dark, heart thumping loud music, dance floor and perfect for party place.Food: the taste of food was good. I like their dessert a lot. Hot brownie with ice cream 😍Staff: The place is packed but the staff manages to give you attention despite that.My verdict: do visit for partying and drinks and dance😍"
1362,First of all i really like the crowd and the dancing ambience the place is best for party animals🤩 food was pretty yummy but service was worst. But it was my best friends birthday bash so I enjoyed very well there. And didn't got time to click foods pictures 😅🤭 #tos @tos
1363,"We didn’t get the offer discount! We showed them the booking id thrice! Still we didn’t get it at the time of billing!! Service was too slow. Food was just okok. We got our food after 45mins and drinks after half n hour of food! Overall experience was pathetic! Won’t recommend!Try others , they r far better. "
1364,Not at all worth to go...food taste is not up to the mark plus in this September they are having a deal of giving offers like pizza at 21 .LOL you will not get that they will say that our oven is not working but it did work for making big pizza n all .worst place to hang out...in my last to last visit there cealing was leaking ....chicken was also not fresh. If i was having a chance to mark negative stars then i would give this restaurant that and for their service even negative stars are more or i would just say that it's even worse than their food ...the manager is rude he made us literally beg to him to bring our food and was not even bothering about what we are saying. Worst place to...read more
1365,"A nice place to enjoy evening. Specially in winters, their food is also nice.they also have valet parking available which is really important for location like club Road where you hardly get any parking. "
1366,"Take off scarlet..such an amazing nd rocking place i had a great party there thrice..The food of this place is my favourite , interior is so nice , the whole staff is well cordinated, dj , music , crowd eveything is so well maintained, I also wanna mention about Mr.Sujeet who is so much coperative with the party dealings.. i just love going this place' TOS' to have a great time..Most poular place of club road punjabi bagh..Everyone should try this place..SIYA"
1367,"Saturday night has to be done right and all thanks to Zomato for it’s recommendation and reviews, I zeroed down to TOS! It was crowded and full of life! They had live dhol and oh my goodness, what a crazy dance night it turned out to be for us!! Loved the whole vibe! Though the room is not very spacious and then the Sheesha makes it little too smoke filled. However, the food is just so delicious! I mean, it compensates for every other thing. We hadBBQ CHICKEN PIZZA - thin crust, yum toppings and just perfect! GARLIC CHICKEN TIKKA - OMG!!

1368,Good ambience! Went there for a Birthday party.Crowd is good and most special thing is we found there a “DHOL WALA” on DJ floor. Food is tasty & staff is cooperative! Enjoyed a lot 🎈🎈
1369,Good place for party with friendsBest!!can have birthday parties and loungecan have beverages and chicken and veggies food.But you have to wait too much for any order and wait can be of 1 hr.
1370,Place is good but their service is really bad. And they are expensive too. Food is good but service spoiled the mood. They can and they have to improve it. Staff people what is written in their menu and don't have most of the things. 
1371,Had an amazing time here. It was my colleagues birthday and the staffs made sure that we had a great time here. The place is quite spacious and the seats were comfortable as well.The food and drinks were amazing and the service was quick too.Everyone loved the place.
1372,Very rude staff. No manners how to deal. Totally disappointed. Taking too much time for food preparation. No one even came to ask for water.
1373,"We ordered veg pizza , makhani pasta & Alfredo white sauce pasta which were mesmerizing. We found staff very helping and service was fast .We had some club sandwiches which were overloaded with mayo. We then moved down the menu ordered all mocktails in the menu and dal makhani and paneer do pyaza were next in our crosshairs. Quantity was satisfying and tasted great.Rooftop is just cherry on top and good place for grabbing some content.We liked this place very much and probably gonna hit this place in future pretty soon. ."
1374,"Ambience 🥂I personally didn't liked the DJ system there. Maybe a great place for Hookah LoversFood quality there is pretty decent. Slow service and the same excuses everytime, ""Your order wasn't punched. I just did that "" I personally feel it doesn't satisfy the standards of Punjabi Bagh Market "
1375,"Pretty big place for hosting a party. They've got the drinks, they've got the food, they've got the music and the dance floor.Got pretty crowded real soon but that's because of the weekend. The rain didn't stop anybody though.A bit over priced for the service and quality.Ambience is pretty good.Food: 3.5/5Service: 3.5/5Ambience: 4.5/5Price: 3/5"
1376,"After reading the good reviews, we went there and took a table on the rooftop.We were highly disappointed with the services , for the ambience I would rate 4 , for the food 3 and for the service 1...overall we had a terrible experience... for placing the order we had to wait for 15 mins, for the drinks again , food was quick but then again we had no serving spoons with it , so had to wait again...for the bill almost 20-25 mins, atlast we had to get up and go to the counter, then they were not having the card machine , then we had to  go down..on complaining to a staff over there that I am not going to pay service charge bcoz of ur pathetic service, he said ""Koi baat nahi""...It...read more"

1378,"Good place to visit in Punjabi Bagh. Ambience is really good & so is its terrace sitting. Snacks tasted good as well.They serve one of the best sheesha.I have been here multiple times and had a great time but today I had a quite disappointing experience. It was Overcrowded, shortage of staff, we had to personally go and call them & service was really disappointing. Our order took more than 45mins and pizza was all cold which was later replaced on request."
1379,"Place is very good the food was really awesome ,the music ,the dance the ambience ,this place gave me best experiences loved the time spent.."
1380,Nice and groovy place to visit with both outside and inside seating which is completed with great DJ and food is cherry on the top has great taste for food like peri peri chicken butter chicken and good shakes complete value for money
1381,Its is great place to go in day time! Food is great! Service is okayish! You won’t find great party ambience in the night! Its is quite overrated to be honest!
1382,Loved the place. Very lively and the terrace ambience was something we just wanted. Umesh Giri took great care of us. Loved his service. Would definitely like to visit again.
1383,Went there on 11th august with family! Recently opened terrace was something everyone was waiting for.. food was delicious.. DJ had a nice collection of songs.. even the kids had fun.. 
1384,Their staff are thieves even they are rude and always yelling.And food is ewww just don't come here they will only give you respect if you spend thousands.
1385,The food waa delicious. Really liked the Alfredo pasta. The ambience was lit specially the dance floor but the staff service was disappointing. They were ignorant.
1386,"Hello foodies if you wanna make your day awesome .wanna have fun then I will suggest you this place .they will surve a full package of fun food,dance music .it's a great place"
1387,Not liked the ambience for family gatherings as air their fill with smell of Hukka. Also observed waiters tasting drinks and foods before serving to customers 
1388,A great place to enjoy drinks food is good but quantity is less as compared to the price they charge. I ordered penne pasta with white sauce and chicken tikka pizza both were awesome to taste. Service is bit slow. Rest a good place to enjoy the weekend vibes.
1389,"Not really up to the hype. Service is very poor, that too considering their pricing. You should try some other options in Punjabi Bagh, I am confident you will find plenty options better than this. "
1390,"So we decided to give this lounge a try after reading about it multiple times on blogging websites(sodelhi etc.). We ordered a bucket(6 pints) of kingfisher ultra and after finishing 3, one of us checked the manufacturing date and we were shocked to see that all the 6 beers were EXPIRED and that too more than 3 months back. (Bottling date : 11/11/17 with 6 months expiry from the date of bottling, pictures attached). On raising this issue with the manager he tried to convince us that it is drinkable as foam wasn’t separating by pouring it in a glass. He finally accepted his fault and obviously waived off the bill for that bucket.This is a basic thing that you expect from lounges to not...read more"

1392,"It was an overall good experience here. The ambience is good, staff is corteous and the DJ is amazing. We booked our college farewell here and tge experience was upto oir expectations. "
1393,"The place is a very lively place with alot of youngsters around. The Alfredo penne pasta is super delicious and so is the vegetable loaded pizza. The shakes are also good but, the Chocolate brownie is a must try."
1394,Reserved table 24 hours before but still no place booked or available for us at our time. Clearly neglected to entertain us.Worst experience highly unprofessional #tos
1395,Gud place..tasty food...dj gud..ambience gud...but service is pathetic..have to improve their service...gud for friends party..nt suitable for family gathering...
1396,"A very lit place situated on Punjabi Bagh club road. Ambience is really pretty and quirky with a touch of sophistication. Both indoor and outdoor seating are great. Coming to food, Murgh Angari Tikka and Chili Chicken, both were delicious and lip smacking. Arabiatta Pasta was very well cooked and sauce also tasted amazing. In the drinks section, you'll find some amazing concoction. We tried My Sweet Bae and Coco Loco, very rejuvenating. A must visit place!"
1397,"When in Punjabi Bagh, visit Take Off Scarlet for scrumptious food and their party-like atmosphere. We started off with their super delicious BBQ Chicken Burger. Also tried Chef Special Chicken Wings, juicy and Crunchy Chicken which was perfectly cooked. Honey Chilli Potato were crisp and had a fine balance of sweet and spicy. For drinks, we tried their Bounty Shake, thick and creamy. Staff was very welcoming and service was quick. DJ plays a good mix of songs, making it a perfect place to party."
1398,"TOS is one of the most happening places in Punjabi Bagh. A spacious enough dance floor, dj playing peppy tracks and a very happening ambience makes it a perfect place for party.We ordered chicken pita pockets which was full of veggies and Chicken chunks stuffed in fresh bread. Chef Special Chicken wings was a perfect mix of sweet and Spicy. Amritsari Fish was perfectly cooked and had a very authentic taste to it. For drinks, we had Oreo and Kitkat shake which were decent. Also, they serve amazing hookah, no doubts about that.Service was quick. It's a good place to hangout with friends, chill over drinks and hookah."
1399,"This is a huge place which comes with indoor and outdoor seating available. Good for its location food is everytime okaish..I would suggest to add and enhance the food items with good taste and presentation. This place has a very loud music which is good but not for kids. Also, they everyday have some events going like dhol night , sufi nifht , live band etc etc. I’ve been to this place for almost 5-7 times and I really go here for the ambience and lively crowd..Service is a bit slow sometimes but otherwise everything is good "
1400,Nice ambience Good service Amitis very helpful.Take off scarlet is a very beautiful place. Such an amazing place to visit in punjabi bagh.Take off scarlet one of the best lounge.... punjabi Bagh.
1401,Slow service. Taste of food is not good. Unfriendly staff. All Drinks not available. Expensive according to its services. Clealiness is required.

1403,Loud music. Average sheesha. A bit steeply priced for punjabi bagh. Food is also average. Wont recommend to go with children. Rooftop is better
1404,I ordered the cold coffee first and or was kinda beyond my expectation it was soo good and i ordered some starters so nicely presented and so tasty and i have tried a lot of places but the main course here is just the best by now and now i go there so often eith friends and family. Great experience and great service.

1409,"Such an amazing place to visit in punjabi bagh.Take off Scarlet has the finest ambience with great food. About the service, it was quite slow. We waited for more than 30mins to even get water after asking so many times and food came after 45mins of ordering.Though the food was good but the services are not upto mark."

1414,"If you are in, Punjabi Bagh, you just know you have to visit Take off scarlett. To be honest, Take of scarlet has the finest ambeince and the food is fingerlicking good. The whole atmosphere is lit up by wonderful music and dim lighting which can set the mood for every evening. The starters are delicious and main course is heart warming. The place is a delight for both non-vegetarians and vegetarians. Mac and cheese , fish and chips ,margereitha pizza are the main attraction along with filling dishes of chicken and mutton. The shakes are a must try and desserts are perfect. So next time you are in Punjabi Bagh ,dont forget to visit take off scarlett."
1415,This is one of the best lounges situated at the Punjabi bagh club road.A perfect 5/5 place for hosting in house party with a large group.You can book your private area in case of Birthday or Kitty Parties.I have been here many times with my gang.

1417,"I have been here twice thinking that may be it happens sometime when there s a miscommunication between the staff. But oh boy, that is not the case. The staff is totally mismanaged and plain rude. They make you wait hours for your order and you need to keep them reminding otherwise it 'll be gone for a toss. I have a request to the owner, the place has been built beautifully, it is the service that is letting you down big time and you need to look into it asap. I really don't know how are they getting such rave reviews. Please buck up your service big time otherwise in the long run it will definitely get tough.Thanks "
1418,Great place to come for a relaxing drink with a great atmosphere. Wonderful service . Good place to dance and enjoy parties. They have terrace too.
1419,"Already visited this outlet a couple of time and and loved the mesmerizing interior and some amazing crowd and music. Tried some amazing starters like paneer Tikka , club sandwiches and penne pasta. They all were great with appropriate quantity.

1428,A very splendid place with good ambience .We organised our college freshers party here.The dj was fun. And the dhol was best.Food is yummy but service was quiet ok ok.Food was yummy. Good place for party
1429,"Place is having good ambience but u wont find crowd like cp. One thing i didn't like was the behavior of staff, they were not courteous towards customer rather some were rude. Live music was the only attraction which starts after 9.00 pm. Less people were there but later after 9.00 pm it was almost full. And less availablity of drinks. Prices were different from that available on zomato. Food was nice. Tried paneer pan pizza it was good for satisfying your taste buds. Will recommend to all the nearby food and beverages hunter. "
1430,"Loved it! Food was yummy! Ambience was great! Loved the dhol! Service was pretty ok ok. We booked our tables online but still struggled to get ours. Anyway , Best birthday ever. "
1431,One word- unprofessional. Worst experience. Even though valet service is there but nobody came at least for half an hour. And then the person at the front office stated that there was rush. Hardly people were there. Do not visit this place.

1485,The crowd was good !! The food was amazing and the waiters were also friendly !! The dj is really amazing loved the atmosphere there !! But they dont have the dj available all the time they have their timings i guess 
1486,The place seems very shady during the day and they don’t start full operations before 2pm. Had to request the manager quite a couple of times to let us use the terrace seating. Lousy service. Not so great food with not so great drinks. Very bad sheesha. Too expensive and unreasonably priced. Plus they charged us extra service charge. Had to fight with the manager to get it deducted from the bill. Never visiting again. Save your money and find a better place than this.

Please change your staff or your restaurant may suffer in the long run. "

Chilli soya champ was bad. We received corn salt and pepper instead of veg salt and pepper.The service was veryyy bad. No one was there to attend to us.

Music was also good but a bit loud.Cons:The staff wasn't able to listen when we were calling out for order due to very loud music, we had to go to them again and again. Service was poor. On that day we were told that RO was not working so they gave us bottled mineral water which was very costly (comparitively) and we had to take multiple times as we were thirsty after dancing. I mean, if RO wasn't working then they should have given bottled water at low cost or should have made some alternative arrangements being a sunday.Overall, expected better from TOS but I hope...read more"
1543,Good food and great menu. Variety available. Poor staff service and valet system is not at all managed. Would love it if service would atleast improve and not have longer waiting time after orders.
1544,"I went TOS last week with my cousins, and it was a good experience with nice food and ambience. There was live singing going on, it was good, but Loved the DJ.Food:I really liked their honey chilli potato."
1545,Pathetic DJ. No one plays music regularly for more than 3 hours no AC is working properly. After regular request no one entertain for songs or service.DONT GO TO SPOIL YOUR SPECIAL DAY.
1546,"I been there twice but faced the same problem with table, they dont know how to treat their customer even though I have prior booking with dineout. If you are confirming then you should reserve your table for thr same, also arrange some better sitting for 2-3 persons. Not even a courtageous manager, who is ready to loose their customer than accomodating even after having vacant seats. Not recommend to anyone. "
1547,"This can be your Saturday party place, serving you a good variety of food and loud music. I usually go to this place whenever in mood of partying or hanging around my friends. The food, drinks and hookah is more than average. I loved their Indian cuisine."
1548,"I really like this place because this place has roof top. They have separate bar, dj, and dance floor lThey play good songs and good lights and dim. They also have good service.I think you should visit this place is really nice place. "
1549,Few days back i visit here with my friends and the restaurant interior is good and nice. I like the food too. And i love the service. The I recommend to people that visit here.
1550,"So recently I visited (TOS) and trust me it was a treat to my taste buds.So i orderedBbq pizza, chicken tikka, Oreo shake and kiwi shake.Pizza is really very good in taste and thin crush is very good.Not only they provide you a healthy and delicious food, but the ambience and service makes it a complete delightful evening.So if you're nearby, do pay a visit and try (Chocolate Brownie), my favourite.It's a perfect place to spend an evening with friends and family."
1551,"The interior is good with lively ambience. This place has roof top and spacious as well. They have separate bar, dj & dance floor but songs are soo loud and lights are dim. The place is affordable, staff is good but service is poor. Panner tikka, murg angari tikka and veg biryani were really tasty. Veg seekh kebab and mushroom cheesy melted taste ok ok.Colf coffee was tasty and spl fresh & bubbly was ok ok."
1552,"So I recently visited this place in Punjabi bagh take off scarlet which is a good place to hangout with friends and throw birthday parties .

1555,We went to this place for a birthday party celebration. There was already some private party going on... so the staff wasn't able to manage the crowd. The music was good. The ambiance was so nice and they also have beautiful terrace seating.
1556,Visited with coup;e of friends last week and found it goood place for hangout but soon it was vanished with tasteless food and mocktails were extra sweets.

1602,"Guys I'm a regular customer of tos from 6-8 months but from last 3-4 mnths I've experienced pathetic service there which my friend Charan Preet t also felt.they keep on ignoring us while we call them, they seem like they aren't even interested in serving us. It usually takes 5-6calls to order something.10-12 times to change coal. We asked for a drink which was in the refrigerator in front of us but they weren't giving us that.but they were interested in selling a drink which was much expensive.last time when i went there all seats around us were vacant i requested them several time to change me seat while they kept on saying that all the table's are reserved we were there for 2 hours...read more"

1606,"I was here on monday noon and still it was packed. Feet tapping music and dimly lit ambience. The place is quite big and interiors are basically covered with statues and painting. Their seating is for every theme like dating, get together, birthday parties & private areas.Coming to food, i would like specially put light on portion size of food they serve in their dishes.The cuisine they serve is Chinese, North Indian, Mexican.

The food is just fabulous , virjin mojito , paneer tikka , honey chilli potatoes and pizza all are must try 😍 incredible service. Terrace is also available for photo shoot and the view is awesome. Visit and experience by yourself."
1612,"Planned to visit today as per its reviews but not satisfied at all. Felt like this place is pretty much overhyped. Cleanliness is not at all on terrace, Installed pedestal fans blowing more water than air. Service is a big issue as we had to call multiple times to waiters for even small things and they were still not bothered at all. Food is also average with inappropriate quantity. Tried Dahi me Kabab, Garlic Chicken Tikka, Paneer tikka pizza and Dal Makhani. Just liked Dal Makhani rest everything is average in taste. Not recommend this place to ruin anyone's parties and evenings. "
1613,It is pretty good place and terrace is beautiful too. food and drink r gud. ambience is good. i have tried chilli chicken in starter and chicken lababadaar in the mains. recommend it
1614,"I had lunch at this place few days back and the saturday spent well. The place was nice with good food and music but little bit expensive and service was also very slow even though the crowd was not so much. If you are a non-vegetarian then I am sure you’ll gonna like their non-veg dishes . I ordered Noodles with gravy manchurian , Veg Pizza , Tandoori Chicken Pizza , Kiwi mocktail cooler( This was very nice...A big Thumbs up !!) and Red Sauce Pasta with Garlic Bread . "
1615,"Despite of being a famous restaurant and lounge, I would say Take Off Scarlet 's price doesn't do justification to the taste of food they serve there... The things I ordered were either too spicy or didn't had any at all... presentation was almost 3 for me... i've seen better at different places... The Ambience is really dark but the DJ there was good keeping you up-to-beat all the time ( legs moving )..The terrace had better decorations though...All and all everything was just fine and good experience I would say a bit expensive though..."
1616,"Great place to hangout with friends. I went there last saturday with 2 other friends and the experience was great. The ambience is great, drinks were chilled and the food was tasty.. what more do I need."
1617,Heard  a lot about this place. I visited there and it didn't let me down. This place was different from other lounges in that area.most amazing thing about it  was its terrace.it was spacious and attractive.ambiance was notch up.food served was  warm and delicious.staff was polite and dj was also good.The cozy atmosphere makes it a perfect place to eat and bond with others.
1618,Went thr last weknd was too crowded but food n drinks were amazing.music was also nice. Crowd was mixed. Service was little slow can be ignored if you dont like loud music place is not for you. Its fun place fr ppl who wanba dance n party 
1619,Denied to serve water for more than 10 people. Asked to buy mineral water instead of normal water. Food was average and atmosphere was loud.
1620,Take off scarlet is a roof top cafe located on Punjabi Bagh club road . Went there to enjoy live screening of ipl match with friends . Had crazy fun . Good crowd and cool atmosphere. Food and service also was perfect 💯 will visit here again

1624,"Tos Cafe is a casual dining restaurant and lounge located on the Club Raod in Punjabi Bagh. The place has a vibrant and colorful ambiance and offers an extensive multi-cuisine menu. The eclectic bar menu offers an array of drinks and spirits along with a variety of finger food items. The premium food menu serves a range of delicious North Indian, Chinese, and Continental delicacies. The additional features are the band and DJ nights hosted there which makes everyone groove on the dance floor. The beautiful open terrace area makes the whole experience worthwhile."
1625,"Been here 2 times and I must say awesome place where you can dance, eat, drink and enjoy but you have to take care that there is very less chance you'll find a parking here. The food is awesome but quantity is less according to price. The taste is awesome as I said we've ordered a pizza, pasta which was sexo awesome and amazing Hukkas. "
1626,"Unprofessional staff and Manager food was shit if you compare any other restaurant in punjabi bagh, we booked a 699/- deal for unlimited alcohol for one and half hour from dineout despite the fact waiter recommended us go for ala carte as you only drink 30+30 ML drinks that finally at the end 2 drinks bill was 1250 plus.Make sure ask for deal before sit. I wont go again nor i recommended anyone. "
1627,"Located on the busy clubroad of Punjabi Bagh, it is a very good place to hangout with friends. The place has a good enough ambiance and serves perfectly tasty food.The only downside I found was that the quantity served is quite less when compared to the prices they are charging. Also the service seemed to be a bit slow.We ordered - Paneer Tikka Pizza, Garden Fresh Pizza, Dahi Kebab, Honey Chilli Potato, White Sauce Pasta, Chilli Garlic Noodles, Virgin Moito.Everything from Pizza to Pasta and Starters was delicious and was worth it!The dishes served here are totally worth trying at least once.. So visit this place straight away on your next outing with friends.Must Try: White Sauce...read more"
1628,"Food was good there (3/5)Sheesha was good too (3/5)Service by Waiter was good too (5/5)But I'm rating this place 1 is because there is not anything lower than that!I booked a table for 11 (Stags) on call for evening and got the confirmation from the manager that due to stags he will provide us the Table on Roof, for which I said 'OK! No Issue'.Just to be sure i booked a table for 11 from Dineout too and got the confirmation on that too!But when i went there, their manager Literally backed out from his commitment and said that roof is Full and he can't provide us any Table! When I showed him my Dineout reservation then he said that booked time has been passed and won't allow us in...read more"
1629,Wow seriously 💯😍Went on Friday and had crazy party 🎉. They had Live band till 11pm and then awesome dj . Visiting here again for sure especially on weekend . Food and drinks were also good. Moreover this place was pocket friendly .
1630,"Take off scarlet is a happening lounge located in Punjabi Bagh . I went there for my friend’s bday party . They had North Indian, Chinese, Italian, Continental Cuisine in the menu . Loved the ambiance and vibe of the place . Totally worth visiting 💯"
1631,"TOS is a great option if you wish to have amazing party . From the time you step in till the time you step out of TOS, you will feel privileged and pampered every single minute as the staff takes care of everything so well .The food served was very good in quality and taste. We enjoyed live singing along with dinner . Overall , I had a good time !"
1632,Entering is a great ambience. Perfect place for friends and family to hang out. Nice presentation of food. I had chicken lollipop which was quite crunchy and juisy. 
1633,"Pathetic is the only word that comes to my mind when I recall my last night's experience at this place. Pathetic staff, pathetic service, pathetic food, pathetic crowd. Staff was very arrogant, nobody was interested in taking our order. We repeatedly waved to the staff but they were ignorant. finally, by God's grace one of the waiters took our order and after ages, the food arrived, which tasted pathetic. This is a brief summary of what I and my friends experienced last night at this place. If I had to describe my entire experience in one word, it would be 'PATHETIC'."
1634,"Pathetic place to visit ever.. bad management, poor service, stale food, bad odour in the entire place, loudest of music during the day time, you cant even talk with person sitting next to you, the best part is management isn’t ready to listen to anybody.. the staff doesn’t even listen regarding the poor quality of food served, infact worst service..never visit this place.. "
1635,"Worst place i hv ever been in life, illiterate and unprofessional staff, too bad service, tasteless food, too loud and the most annoying manager. These people pretend to b so sweet whn they take booking and then they show their real faces.Manager is so cunning and claims to be the no1 cafe in p.bagh, but i would say its the most cheapest and degraded cafe. No business ethnics, and see the quantity they serve.I booked a kitty with them and took my 11 guest but these people have literally behaved the worst they can."
1636,Sitting here with my bunch of girls right now waiting for the food from an hour!! Poor and very slow service..no one listening..overly loud music giving everyone headache..bad quality of food..raw chicken..stinky ambienence..our worst night mare!!Never visit this place!!
1637,"Wowww ! What a place with good music , food , ambience and hookah .Everything here is delectable and heart pleasing ❤Ordered different shakes and some snacks . Loved everything 💯And not to forget if u are a hookah lover . Then this is the place to be ."
1638,Visited this place on tuesday . It is a spacious  lounge spread on 2 floors each having its own uniqueness . Food was delicious and even the quantity served is good . Plus point of tos was that this place was not boring on tuesday night as well . There was live singing on terrace and amazing dj in lounge area . Will visit again 😎
1639,Tos is Most trending and happening place in west delhi . I have been to almost every lounge in the area but never enjoyed as much as i enjoy at tos . Place has beautiful and spacious ambiance . I absolutly love cubana sitting on terrace . It's so classy and comfortable . Talking about food and drinks they too are on point . Kudos to the management . They are handling it amazingly 💯
1640,"Second time I have been at this place. One of my all time favorite Italian restaurants. Very authentic, be prepared for some wait on peak hours. Burger and pizza is a must. I will be back."
1641,"The best part of this place is DJ which is available at all times afternoon , evening or night . This place had variety of ambiences . Whethr u want to dance or sit back and relax , it has it all . Food was very well prepared and presented . Really loved crispy corns and oreo shake 😍"
1642,"The fish i ordered was way too salty. Sitting on the roof top was quite a task as mosquitoes wont stop biting and the staff reacts only when you are about to leave. Overall, not recommended. "
1643,"A great place to hang out with friends.The name itself sounds so happeningThis place has an amazing ambience😅In lunch we ordered dal makhni paneer veg pizza and pasta red sauce.It's a beautiful place the ambience is magical and gives positive vibes.. I wish to visit again ❤Food/Beverage , Service and Ambience everything was on point .Overall this place deserves 5/5 🤘"
1644,Tos is that uniquely innovative place where people can enjoy the luxuriance of both food and ambiance. It was my 5th visit to this place.I try not to miss going there whenever they have Prayag band night. This place undoubtedly is the best in west delhi 💯
1645,"Tos is located at the main Club Road, Punjabi Bagh and it is the multi cuisine lounge. Lavishly escalating across 2 floors, the interiors of the place are extremely beautiful. The lip smacking pub food served at Tos has its roots in the delicious Indian food. In snacks we ordered pizza and red sauce pasta. In mocktails we ordered virgin mojito and blu lagoon. The service was great and manager Surjeet made sure our experiene was good !!"
1646,went for a friend's birthday party to this place.. it has a wonderful ambience and dance floor.. apart from that food was good.. although pitcher for any of the drinks was not available.. perfect place for party lovers..
1647,"A descent cafe with descent decor. The interior is awesome. It is a big cafe in Punjabi Bagh club road with a dance floor. Very ideal for hosting parties , County's, farewell parties etc. The food is average. I ordered hakka noodles , spring rolls and pizza. Place is good if you go out with your group to enjoy . The cafe has a separate space for couples in the corner so that they are not disturbed by the other crowd. Overall good cafe to visit "
1648,"I loved the food. Amazing service. Lovely decor.The day I went to this place , it had Lohri celebration . It had drum rolling and people dancing to the beats. Such a fusion of dholak and western songs. What an experience."
1649,"Been there on suggestion of someone and got disappointed very much..management was not concerned about the customers, there was no one interested in taking the order and no one was interested in taking care of the seating of customers.."
1650,"nothung worked fine during my visit. I did not got any place , It was full of hookah smoke I dont know whether there exhaust sytm works or not . The crowd was like between 15 to 20 years . I did not got place to sit on dj floor than i Decided to go on terrace and there fan was not working it took 45 min to get that fixed and when i ordered the glasses was not clean and the food I have ordered was chikken tikka paneer tikka chilly potato .evrything was like chinese van se khana laa ke de dia ho bas serve kra hai. It was very bad experience and I wil.not recommend any1 to visit there. That place is only for kids and only running for kids as in good places below 25 entry is not allowed."
1651,I would love to visit this place again . There are very few places in city with such happening atmosphere . It's perfect for party animals like me . Food was tasty and shakes were great . Must try 
1652,Take of scarlet is the most pocket freindly and decent lounge in punjabi bagh.Happened to visit this beautiful place on sunday afternoon.The place was lit with good music 🎧Had amazing time with my friends dancing and eating good food . Must try paneer lababdaar and dal makhni in their main course . Tastiest I have ever had .Definitely Recommended ♥
1653,Open and very relaxing place in Punjabi Bagh. Ceasar salad was fresh and healthy. Pizza was good and they have done great topping. Service was slow but friendly. Good place.
1654,TOS has always been one of my favourite Saturday night place . I really love how this place plans different weekend calendar every month so that party people like me can enjoy to bits .They serve one of the best hookah in town . Food and drinks are also delicious 👌🏻Sometimes they also do fireworks on the bar which makes the crowd go crazyyyy . All in all this place is love 💕
1655,"A nice place in punjabi bagh, its situated right in the heart of a busy place, where you can find many cafes, pubs and eateries to satisfy your hunger and enjoy a great time. I've been here twice, my first visit was a really nice one, an easy 4.5, but the subsequent was a disaster, which makes me want to give it an average rating of 3.The first time i went there, the food was great, drinks were huge and plentiful, taste was great, service was prompt too. But during my next visit, the food lacked taste, drinks were served in basic and short glasses, even the drinks that i ordered the first time around, no consistency at all !The service was very bad, the servers didn't took our order for...read more"
1656,"If you are looking for a place with good food , ambience , music , hookah then take off scarlet is the perfect option . Property is spread on two floors .

Everything we ordered was well presented and served on time . Overall it was a great experience ."
1657,"Take Off Scarlett. A very well known place in Punjabi Bagh and also one of the best outlet.Visited with friends, the ambience was really very amazing. Staff was good and co-operative. They have rooftop sitting as well. Great place in the night. You can feel the atmosphere.I had Drums of heaven and Pasta.items were really very good. It was well roasted and flavours added perfectly.Presentation was also very good and service was good.Overall, a great experience with this outlet."
1658,i dont know how this restaurant can trend for so many weeks and because of the rave reviews i planned a date night here. they totally ruined the night. we ordered cocktails.i ordered red wine sangria and instead of that i got vodka with fruits. asked them why this blunderous mistake to which i got a reply that the bartenders are working since long and this is how you make it. the food was horrible as well.we ordered biryani..waited for raita for half an hr.had to eat that cold one without raita..after finishing half of the meal raita came with lots of sugar..i mean wow..biryani with sweet raita. the place was very shady as well..couches burnt with cigarette or mayb hukka..they were also...read more
1659,"Take of scarlet ,located in Punjabi Bagh I went there with my friends.This place gives you party vibes with there decor and interior.They have two different spaces one is the loud music zone and other one is terrace zone.service was good and staff had the good knowledge about there menu.i tried there veggie pizza, chilly chicken with virgin mojito..There food was super delicious and having some amazing flavours.i recommend this place to everyone"
1660,"'Take Off scarlet' sounds poetic right? well for me everything about this outlet is amazing. last Tuesday I went there for some quickie snacks. The place is very good enclosed with Rooftop to sit & chill around. I orderedWhite Sauce Pasta and Veg. Burger. It was too yummy. They cooked the dishes with patience and dedication and that's what I liked about this place. White sauce pasta was perfectly cooked, mingled with salt and spices which made the pasta more Delicious. Burger was also very good. Perfectly fried. This is must visit place. "
1661,Its a good lounge in punjabi bagh and I really liked the name of this cafe and I quite visited here so many times with my siblings and friends . A bery enjoyable place and serves you nice food and they also have great ambience 👍🏻😍
1662,"Trust me Guys, I am a Big Paneer Dish Fan and I'm saying it on record here that I have never tasted Paneer Lababdar as tasty as i was served here at TOS.The Best Paneer Dish ever!We started with beers and one Oreo Shake, both okay.Then for cocktails, one LIIT which was not too strong and one Vodka based cocktail whick gave a kick to my frnd.For food, their penne peri peri pasta was awesome.Chicken Lollipop was okay, not at par.... Butter Naan was soft and fluffy...So, overall we had a good time.... As that night we had DJ Kellie in the house and she played some super awesome dance numbers. They had Dhol too.... "
1663,I think punjabi bagh can be called as hub of clubs and cafes. New and new are being added to the club road. Toss is a place that no one can resist to go after looking to thw terrace pictures! Amazing experience each time i have been to the place 👌🏼 
1664,"Pro: Nice ambience, arrangement was good.Cons: Snail Pace Services. it need to be improved. it took more than hour to get our orders. I cant recommended this place"
1665,Heard a lot about this outlet and trust me it’s worth that hype 😍 Went on a Saturday night with friends and had lots of fun . DJ was amazing 👌🏻 service food and hookah was excellent. Completely loved it . Must try chicken malai tikka and pasta .
1666,*BEST PLACE TO HAVE PARTY IN BUDGET* The best thing about this place is its DJ which always play best tracks in town and can fit anybodys budget with lip smacking food and attentive staff. The crowd is also great and the place is comfortable to have ALL GIRLS NIGHT.What I recommed to eat (for vegetarians):1.Dahi kebab2.Pizza 3. Chilly potato 4. Manchurian order any of the above and you wont leave dissappointed. :) 
1667,"Absolutely Loved the place. The food was great, the ambience, the service and the crowd. It is one of those few places which is an ideal location for a great Sunday Party."
1668,This is a lit place located in Punjabi Bagh. This place has a good approachable staff. They are very polite. Two floored place. Pretty outdoor sitting. Food was very tasty. You would love the pasta and peri peri lasagna . A jam packed place still the service was good. I hope it helps! 
1669,"TOS at Punjabi Bagh is one of the most prominent place for enjoying night life.Recently we visited this place. It is built on two floors. This place is surely a must visit place for party lovers. Talking about ambiance nice ambiance with dim lighs and a spacious sitting arrangements.Its dj is absolutely different to dance atWe started with chicken  malai tikka,veg platter was well cooked and well presented.We had virgin Mojito nd fruit punch as well.It was full of people having a great experience.Later we had dal makhani n buttet naan.It was very delicious to eat.At last we ordered brownie with ice cream.All in all it was amazing to spend evening at TOS."
1670,"I went here on a weedend evening with a group of friends. The place was pretty crowded. They have a huge seating area and a pretty good ambience. One thing that really disappointed me was that the service was REALLY REALLY slow. We were sitting on the corner seat and one of us literally had to get up so as to call someone to take our order.Coming to the food, we had the following things:Electric lemonade:A refreshing drink with nice flavours and taste.Red sauce pasta veg:The sauce was really good, like really. I really liked this pasta, being very specific about this one, this is one place i liked in case of red sauce pasta.Paneer tikka pizza:A nice option, good taste. A good...read more"
1671,"Dined at this place last month on my birthday. It wasn't too crowded that day. chose outdoor seating. Ambience is pretty cool. Food was good. Service was slow even with less crowd.They refused to turn on the volume of music which was a kill feel kinda thing. Over all, it is a decent place. "
1672,I went with my friends to this place known as TOS(take off scarlet)Ambience is lit here with nice dj and dance floorFood is good here with good staff and service 
1673,"TOS has an amazing ambience but, unfortunately, equally bad service. No doubt, their food was mouth watering and amazing. Excellent DJ. TOS could have been perfect if not for the service. "
1674,"The only thing good about this place is that it's spacious. I ordered cheese nachos, pizza and spring rolls. And trust me none of the dish was amazing. The pizza was dry and kind of cold. Not even a single dish gave me the feeling that it's worth spending my money on. The food is quite costly as compared to it's worth, quantity and taste. If you're a food lover then I won't ever recommend this place to you."
1675,"Take Off Scarlett is a lovely place in punjabi bagh which is purely fine for all your party or your next romantic date. A huge place with arts and statue from Romanian past. They serve lip smacking food and great music.We would recommend you to try :CHILLY PANEER : Spicy and juicy, full of veggies and big paneer pieces.DAHI KE KEBABA : crisp outside and soft inside served along with mint saucePANEER TIKKA PIZZA : pan crust pizza topped heavily with cheese and paneer.BROWNIE SHAKE : Thick and chocolatey"
1676,"Take of scarlet is considered as one of the best restaurant in west Delhi Punjabi Bagh and my experience was almost amazing at this place.It is built on two floors. It has a great ambience with dim lights all around nd It has a rooftop also where you can enjoy much. They serve u the quality with delicious taste.Recently I visited this place with my friends.We ordered Veg platter amazingly presented ,Chicken malai tikka absolutely yummy and Chilly chicken With coco loco mocktail and breezer.There after we ordered main course in which we had dal makhani nd butter naan.Brownies with ice cream was yummy in dessert.All in all we had a great time at take off scarlet."
1677,The food quality and flavours made up sufficiently for the very loud music that this place has to offer. Try the following and you will not be disappointed:-Classic Fish & Chips-Meat balls peri peri-Cheese cigar roll-Thai spring Rolls-Crispy chilli mushroom
1678,Wow place to go with friends. Great ambiance. At night you can opt for terrace as well (really peaceful). Mocktail are quite expensive and tastes really good. A complete value for money.👌🏻🖖🏻
1679,This place has the best terrace in Punjabi bagh ...it is cosy comfortable and beautiful...food is pretty decent and so is overall ambience... while terrace is good for people who want to relax and talk...there is awsome party place on the other floor where we danced our hearts out and music was super loud.... Saturday night was worth spending here!!!
1680,"Nice Environment but too expensiveThey serve Bisleri 1L Bottle which cost ₹20 generally at ₹75 named ""mineral water"".Also they are serving Liquor to People less than 25 years of age"
1681,"The food is good but not totally worth it ambience is good , service is also fine , a place you can visit once located in Punjabi Bagh opposite Starbucks , nice place to hang out with friends "
1682,"Place is an older Chinese restaurant.  Food is standard authentic Chinese, but as such, does not allow for any modification of menu.  As such, even though I liked the food, my friend did not.  Recommend only for those that want down to earth Chinese."
1683,"This lounge has a beautiful and euphoric ambience, and delicious preparations from a variety of cuisines that includes North Indian, Italian, Chinese and Fast Food. With an exhilarating nightlife and amazing music, it is a great hangout place when visited with one’s friends and colleagues. Lose yourself in the beautiful rooftop arrangements and dance the night away or simply enjoy the live sport screening with your friends. What we ordered?.Chicken Malai Tikka -These were big pieces of chicken which were really very juicy and tasted amazing with the onions and mint sauce served along with the dish. - 4.5/5Crispy Chicken fingers -These were like chicken ke pakore.

1697,"Went on a Sunday, sat on the rooftop for hookah and to enjoy the weather. The ambience is good but theres no cleanliness, tables were dirty floors were dirty, seating are a lil uncomfortable and dirty. We shouted for servers to come over and take order, but the server was very polite, water was given upon asking after 15 mins. Hookah was ok not so good, fish and chips were not good, chilli chicken was ok, falafel pita pocket were a disaster they way they made it but the falafel inside tasted good, dahi ke kebabs were good, salads and cocktails were unavailable, peri peri pizza was just some other pizza it wasnt peri peri for sure.

1701,This place is another best place in punjabi bagh to have some great mid-week party or get together with your gang. The mid lit interior and head banging music makes this place awesome. They have many themed seating areas...like couch seating cabins for personal parties...hot corners for dates....and lit center for a big party.The quality and quantity of dishes they serve is worthy of every penny spent here.We would recommend you to have.PANEER TIKKA : soft and juicy served with mint sauce.CHICKEN TIKKA SANDWICH : filled with sauces and choppen chicken piecesCHEESE NACHOS : Loaded with cheese and topped with mayo.
1702,"Last week I went to this place with my friends. I liked the place as its too spacious; good place to party. In starters we had nachos, spring rolls, white sauce pasta and honey chilly potato. Everything was tasty but I didn’t like the spring rolls much. Then we had biryani, paneer lababdar and garlic naan. Overall we had a good experience."
1703,"I went to this place few days back with my friends. This is good place to chill with friends. Its very spacious; they have a dance floor also so small parties can be done there. First of all we had some snacks like nachos, chilly potato, drums of heaven with some drinks. We also had hookah and then we ordered white sauce pasta and spring rolls. Starters were fine but spring rolls were very oily. Then in main course we had biryani, paneer lababar with garlic naan. It was good. We all had a good time there."
1704,"It was my b'day and somehow it fell on the starting of navratri. Due to no crowd at all, the club was closing itself pretty early at 11:30. We requested them to just open up till 12, because we had called them earlier and they did confirm that they would be open till 12:30. Well, the manager could have very courteously asked us and we would have left, but he demanded a bill of 15000 in order to keep the bar running.  I had heard too much good about the club but all went into vain. Pathetic attitude. Very very pathetic."
1705,"Take off scarlet is a good place to hangout in punjabi bagh. The ambience is good. They have a rooftop as well. The food is good in taste , but  quantity is not upto the mark. "
1706,worse please to visit. manager ask to spend at least 20k if we stay till 12:30.not good for birthday celebrations.not recommend at all. Ruined brother's birthday.
1707,"Very good North Indian place: clean, close-enough-to-authentic, and you don't walk out smelling like you've been sitting in a kitchen all day. Food was really tasty and perfectly prepared. Ambiance is nice,open and spacey. Hit this spot."
1708,3rd grade service and we have ordered food here but its above 30mins nd we havent our food yet.. 3rd class waiters everything is worse nd the bad lounge here..😡😡
1709,"management was absolutely terrible. kept shifting us from table to table, forgot our order and ended up serving us the wrong dish. ambience, food and drinks were good but the terrible management let us down in the overall experience."
1710,This place is super beautiful at its own. Terrace are is amazing. I have been to the place many times. Food is amazing. Prices are okayish. And dj is amazing that needs to be mentioned
1711,"A good place to enjoy your party night with friends with comfortable sitting arrangement and great food. Bar is great in terms of drinks and service. Dance floor and music is good. If you are planning to party and dance with your friends on high volume music, it’s a place to consider. For seamless drinking experience, order straight drinks. "
1712,The restaurent is situated on punjabi bagh’s club road and have indoor aswell as terrace seating. Terrace seating is very beautiful and is very nicely decorated with plants. I ordered bruschetta first it was nicely baked and perfectly topped with tomatoes. Other thing I tried is veg kebabs and even they are very good and filling is good too. But main show stealer was their gourmet burger which was huge and very delicious and is very filling. Dal makhani is very creamy and is highely recommended. Arushi

1714,"I have heard a lot about this place so thought to give a try. I have ordered TOS Spl Fresh and Bubbly Moctail which was good. The taste of lime and other ingredients was balanced. In food i had Nachos with Salsa and Sour Cream & Pasta Arabiatta. Food presentation was good but taste was not up to the mark. Pasta was over cooked and Nachos were very dry and not properly cooked. It disappoint me. Service was not quick, i got my drink after food was served. Price is decent. Ambience was good and lively. "
1715,Restaurant though provided 30% discount on food bill. But charged compulsory service charge of 10% and Vat@20% on non alcoholic drinks(not sure if this is legal)  apart from GST. Thus discount is nullified by charging illegal and unwanted service charge

1720,"TOS is the best place to be if you're looking for a terrace sitting in Punjabi Bagh.I ordered Moscow Mule, Green Apple Martini, Veg Pizza, Lasagne, Brainfreezer Hukka and Ceasar Salad.I would rate 5/5 for the pizza and the cocktails. They were served well on time and they were amazing. Moscow Mule is generally served in a copper mug, but it wasn't served in the same here. Although the drink was tasty.Ceasar Salad was fresh and had all the fresh vegetables and lettuce. It is a must order at this place.TOS had a good variety of Hukka and it's the perfect  place to have hukka on the terrace.Lasagne was served hot with garlic bread and pasta salad. It was truly amazing. I would rate...read more"
1721,"We were seated in the terrace area of the lounge, which was great in accordance with the weather. The lasagna and salad were really good, and for drinks both the cocktails- Green apple martini and Moscow mule were a-mazing! We got a complementary hookah at the time, which kind of compensated for other things :DBut one thing that disappointed me was the service, which is why I am giving it a 3 star rating. Overall, it's a feel good place, with good food."
1722,"This is a nice rooftop place. I liked the ambience and the cost is pretty decent. But, their service is horrible. I guess they’re short on staff and this increases the wait times to an irritating extent. Also, they haven’t maintained the place and you’ll find shaking tables and dirty seats. Food is good though and reasonably priced. "
1723,"Interiors & ambience - (4.0)As you enter the place you are welcomed by roman theme and the place is dim lit with mood setting instantly to party The dj comes after 3 pm and is one of the best out there in punjabi baghFood - (4.0) I ordered chicken , pizza, nachos , dahi kebabs , chocolate brownie and all of them were worth their price .

I tried their veg. Club sandwiches which they say club I found it as a mayonnaise sandwich and chilled served. I tried they margarita pizza the crust is good and so much of cheesy the only thing I didn’t like it’s tomato base little bit sweet. Service: I hope dhaba serves better than they serves they are serving almost expiring beer to me and service is so slow can’t imagine about it should be better and they should know what they serving us. In end I can say they have usual menu...read more
1726,Ambience is good. Special at the roof top. If I talk about food main course is amazing. Really liked the biryani and mix veg. Even garlic naan was good. Service is lil slow. But everything else is amazing. 
1727,"This is the rating based on the ambience, rest I don't know what kind of attitude the servers carry. You order something, they get you some other thing saying "" yahi lena hoga apko, jo kar sakte ho kar lo."" I mean, like seriously???? Woahhh.! Then you guys have no future left my dear. Please look into the service. I don't know how people are giving them a 5 rating. The food here is just average. Zomato should definitely keep a check on the food quality and taste as well.

1732,"Recently been to this place with my frnd in the early evening. We both were in mood for some chit chat so instead of going to regular coffee place we thought of this place. And i felt it was a great choice, totally loved their outdoor seating. I am going back to this place for sure just for their easy breezy ambiance.  Though we were not hungry as such so just ordered Crispy Chilli Potatoes, Chocolate Shake and one Strawberry and Kiwi Slush.Chilli potatoes were just by their name as were too chilly, didn’t like their shake but the slush was amazing.Service was ok but points just for their ambiance and music."

Waited just took the glass from the counter and kept at one corner of our table and left. Rest two beers came after 1.5 hrs. It was surprising to see the BEERS were at ROOM TEMPERATURE.

It has two levels. The lower one is lounge part with dj floor and the upper one is the open terrace.Firstly, we ordered Manchow soup. Believe it was best soup. Then we ordered starters both veg and non veg. It includes Spring Roll, Mix Sause Pasta, Chilly Chicken, Murg Malai Tikka. The quality and quantity was excellent. Taste was also good.

There is also a rooftop available, where they allow small parties and get-togethers.We tried nachos, chicken tikka, Amritsari fish fry, pasta. All of it was pretty average. Amritsari fish was not even close to what Amritsari fish is usually. They serve some pretty cheap liquor. Consequently, you take a tradeoff with the quality of liquor.

1741,Oh wellThis place is situated right on the Punjabi bagh club main road where you can park your car hassle free and enjoy a good experience with a fine decor and dining The food has been delighting and so is the service My favorite picks from the cuisine were apple sangria and corn fried chicken fingers I’ve loved everything else I’ve ordered with hot n sour chicken soup would be the best start to the meal I’d always recommend to consult the bar tender if you’re looking for something into mocktails/cocktails because he is really good with drinksOne good place in that area!

The DJ played all the dance anthems and made us groove to every bit.The quantity of food could be increased according to their pricing system.They also have a very nice terrace seating great for chilly evenings! The indoor seating was also comfortable and spacious.Over all a good experience, just like any other clubs out there."

A big yes ...and a thumbs up👍"
1747,"The place has great interiors and the terrace is beautiful. The ambience of the place is great. Went for lunch there and realized that it is better for parties than for normal outings. The food was good. Veg items had less quantity and the taste was okay. Chilly potato and virgin mojito were good in taste. Talking about the service, it was extremely slow and the staff doesn't know how to work. Basic things were not provided and they took more than 20 min to get things like spoons and forks. Overall the place is good and the food is tasty. But the service is not upto the mark."

Coming to my order, we ordered plenty of dishes, but the best of them all was Chicken Pita Pockets, Lemon Fish, Drums Of Heaven And Lamb Burger and shakes to accompany our meal😊Shakes were pretty average although food was good, its decent place to chill with your friends❤️"

The outdoor seating area is manicured with perfection and looks really pretty. Coming to the food I tried a couple of items out of which I liked honey chilli potatoes and chilli garlic fish the most and would definitely recommend these two. Chicken 65 was stale and the chicken had turned black and chewy. Virgin mojito tasted great. The service was really very slow and the waiters very rude.

The best I had was tandoori chicken.The marination on that dish was amazing.But I'm gonna tell you that the service of this place is pathetic.They have to work very hardly on that.I waited for almost 20 mins for clean plates to come and my order was 10 mins early.So by the time plates arrive (which I have to ask myself for 3 times) my Hakka noodles were cold.And the served melted ice...read more

Though the rooftop was temporary unavailable at the time of our visit we still had a gala time with the Dj setting the tone.Coming to the food and drinks we tried the paneer tikka, bruschetta and Loaded Nachos for starters. The bruschetta, loaded with fresh tomatoes were really good. The paneer tikka too tasted as expected. Next came Pasta and springrolls. Their taste too was really good . Mojito and bluelagoon complemented the food perfectly.For main course Dal Makhni, Paneer Lababdaar along with Garlic naan and Lachcha...read more"
1758,"Finally got a chance to visit this gem in Punjabi Bagh,Take off Scarlet and I have to say that it was a memorable night for me! The tone and ambience of the place is just class apart! The service is lightning quick and the food and drinks also do justice to your taste buds.I tried their Paneer tikka,loaded nachos,Red Sauce Pasta as starters along with Manchow soup! Then for main course,I tried their north indian dishes,Dal makhni,Paneer Lababdar along with Aloo Pyaaz Kulcha,butter and garlic naan and my craving for north indian ended blissfully! The Virgin Mojito and Blue Lagoon mocktails where also amazing!Also,I enjoyed their Blue Apple Sheesha,it was one of the best I've tried in a...read more"
1759,Pocket friendly. Great ambience.​Staff is cooperative. They serve one of the best hukka. They have enough space for dancing. Best place in punjabi bagh in budget.
1760,"Situated on the club road area in Punjabi Bagh, Take off scarlet is a perfect party place in West Delhi. They have two floors with separate sitting areas - one is the lounge with a dance floor and the other one is a rooftop bar. We opted for the rooftop bar area on as the weather was really amazing & we enjoyed the tranquilizing ambience of this place. We started our lunch with some drinks & appetisers. We ordered My sweet babe mocktail and a Kiwi cooler mocktail. Kiwi cooler was very refreshing with sweet & tangy taste. Then we tried Hakka noodles with egg, paneer tikka and veg seekh kebab. Hakka noodles were okayish. But paneer tikka & Veg seekh kebab are the must eat dishes here. We...read more"
1761,"Take off scarlet is a lounge & bar spread across 2 floors on the club road area in Punjabi Bagh. We opted for the rooftop bar area on Monday afternoon. The weather favoured us & we enjoyed the cool & vibrant ambience of this place. The service was bit slow and the staff was lost & unattentive. But the good food compensated for that very nicely. Some of my favourite dishes here are - Dahi ke kebabs, paneer tikka in starters. In mains, their paneer do pyaza is a must try dish and it shouldn’t be missed at any cost. What really impressed me is that they don’t use unnecessary oil/butter in their dishes and that’s why  Everything was simply amazing. It was fresh in taste & unique in...read more"
1762,Nice experience ❤️ we actually booked for rooftop but it was not available. The ambiance was good including the food😍😍 DJ was quite loud otherwise our experience was very good 😅❤️❤️ will Visit again ❤️
1763,I was partying at Take off Scarlet and wast about to leave and then I found staff trying to kill another staff by knife. I was so scared to see and even nobody was present from management to handle the situation. This place is not at all safe for anyone. Even service was   pathetic. It's so sad that we have to incur such a bad experience due to completely irresponsible management. Anyone can be victim as staff is so cruel. This is not a family place. I will  never recommend anyone to come here.
1764,It’s surely an astounding lounge leading Punjabi Bagh. The ambience and the food tops the preference list with the amicable staff. The terrace is something to take a look on. 
1765,First impresion is the last impresion but TOS can not able to prove it. After saying continously about 1hour after which DJ starts and only for 30minutes and no place for the enjoyment you can waste your money here.
1766,An elegant and classy lounge.Take Off Scarlet is the one of the best lounge in the Punjabi bagh.  Its mainly famous for its rooftop. Although this place has 2 floors one is the lounge and the other one is the rooftop. I have visited this place twice. First time I was sitting on the third floor. The place was so good with dim LED lights. This place is far better than some lounge in Punjabi bagh with mannequins. The DJ was good and the floor where you can dance for long.  The food was tasty. Service was lil bit slow. And the next time at the rooftop. This place is a place of fun where you can go with your family or friends to have fun. At night the lightning at the rooftop made it a really...read more
1767,"Take Off Scarlet is easily one of the most popular lounges at the Club Road which has a generous amount of those. The ambience is really party esque with dim lightings with a dance floor and a big set for the DJ. The interiors are beautiful with a few LED embedded tables and a lit bar. The service is comparitively quicker and the food is better too. We ordered a number of things, Chicken Pita Pockets which were the best option in my opinion, Chef Special Chicken Wings, BBQ Chicken Burger, Lamb Wok in Bean Sauce and an oreo and kit kat shake and an orange mocktail. The drinks need to be worked upon a bit. The sheesha was really good looking and didn’t lack on the smoke either. Overall...read more"
1768,I accidentally left a bottle of miniature whiskey in my pocket (completely empty by the way). As we started with the drinks and orders . I just took out the bottle to show it to my friend. The staff immediately notices it and accuses us of illegally drinking our own booze! i showed them the empty bottle but they wouldnt believe and insisted that i paid a fine and said they saw me pouring the drink on the camera. On insisting on seeing the recording they refused to show and asked us to leave. Needless to say the night was ruined.
1769,"Good place with good music. I had good time with my friends. Things which I tried here were dahi ke kebab which was just fine, corn salt n pepper it was good, French fries which I did not like it, it was full of oil then I tried pasta with Alfredo sauce which was the worst choice that I made and lastly I tried veg Hakka noodles which was again really very bad. I should say this that here food was not up to the mark but as I said I was with my friends and if you are with your friends then you can really have a good time."
1770,Horrible hookah service. Takes back hookah in one hour direspectfully. No other lounge takes hookah in one hour and that too without any prior information. Poor place! 
1771,I went to take of scarlet had seating on 4th floor and that was my mistake I should have taken rooftop seating  on 4th floor Hukka smoke was so much felt like suffocating  . Other then that loved it ambiance was good music was good and saw the live music loved it  . I will go there again for sure but will take roof top seating 
1772,"It was a good experience. Ambience was ok...I like there food we ordered dal makhni ,paneer butter masala , stuff kulcha all were very tasty.. overall it was good and service was also ok"
1773,"This place is just love..😍😍Their ambience is lit. ❣Even on weekday, the crowd was too good..Their service is little slow but the wait was worth it as the food was really delicious. ❣We had mix sauce pasta, cheese baked pita hummus, omg burger and thin crust pizza. All the dishes tasted right. ✔In drinks, we had cosmopolitan, virgin mojito and chocolates shake. They were also amazing.Overall we had a good time. 😙"
1774,"Rude staff, Misbehaviour, bad food, bad service! Its 0/5. Very bad service.I wish i could give negative ratings. Will never visit this place."
1775,One of the worst cafe’s in punjabi bagh i wish i could review you people negative🤬👎🏻 service is extremely pathetic and disgusting! I guess you should close your cafe and start working with your services and then enter the market to survive😡😖
1776,"The outlet in Punjabi Bagh is solely for youngsters and not for family outing. The food was fine and so was the crowd.The ambiance was fine as well, the rooftop setting is inadequate for large gathering though. The thing that pissed me off was the extremely bad service. After waiting for more than an hour for our order to be noted, the dishes arrived at intervals of half an hour, that too cold. The service improved only after they came to realise that the bill is going to be hefty at our table. Inclusive of the horrendous service, you can certainly find better outlets at this price."
1777,"A flop show, actually setup is nice but apart from that not a single thing i liked about this place.Food was bad and expensive, music was too loud and yeah the staff was really not cooperative."
1778,This place used to be nice. But now it sucks. Poor service and no respect for their customers. Crowd is very bad and you won’t feel good over here. There are better options.
1779,"My favourite party place in punjabi bagh club road,kind of a pocket friendly bar with awesome sheesha and great variety of food with soothing ambiance and lively events and nice crowd,rooftop facilities is available but there is not proper ventilation facility.Delicacies you can order:butter chicken pizza,chicken wings,manchurian,paneer tikka,dal makhani,butter chicken"
1780,"The place was good. But they seem to have a poor budget. All the things i order was not available like spaghetti, cocktails, shakes. Hust one kind of pizza available. Also the chilli chicken was not available, insted they they changed the order without asking. They seem to have just copied the menu from some other place. Why do you do this when you don't have things to offer. This is so immature of you guys. Totally not worth the visit. Also, forgot to add that the bruschetta was cold and worst you can try. Please visit some good places in delhi to atleast have a good taste of dishes. "
1781,I went here on my birthday and it is a nice place to hangout with with friends. There can be some improvements in the food otherwise its a good place.
1782,Take off scarlet has a great ambience with an amazing food.. it also has a bar for alcoholics and you can dance on your favourite beats as it has a dance floor!!
1783,"Though Hukka or sheeshah have been banned all around Delhi, there are few places where you may enjoy the flavourful smokes and enjoy music and food! Take of Scarlet situated in Punjabi bagh has options in both for rooftop dining or the lounge seating! A nice place for parties or for a random plan with friends, TOS gives you options of different alcohol beverages with mocktails too. The roof top dining has a nice view and a great ambience with light music.. these places focus on the ambience and alocohic beverages and the hukkah so it obviously impacts the taste of food! Though they have a wide options for snacks I went for pasta penne alfredo! The taste was fine. Electric lemonade was...read more"

1787,Food is great...but the service can't be any worse. It's a great place but the service can't be any more worse...we were almost alone..and weren't even served with water till the end...
1788,"Take off scarlet, punjabi baghWent there for new year eve's party. The experience was really bad. Even though we pre booked, dint get a space to sit and having snacks and drinks which were included in the package was almost impossible. What left (which was almost zero item) reached the buffet area. Also the intake was more than the space available. The walk in entries were given preference as they were an extra pay off to this unit. Service was really poor. Crowd was also not good. A couple could not survive easily and enjoyment was nil. This ruined the whole new year's Eve plan (the day is my birthday as well). Pathetic experience.Taste of snacks and main course - 6/10Overall -...read more"
1789,I had gone to tos (take off scarlet)  and it was a pleasant experience. It is a beautiful place with painted art on their walls and  soft music playing.

I had ordered: -Orders: -🥩Murg Malai Tikka🍖Drums of Heaven🥤Hazelnut Shake🍤Chicken Korma🍘Laccha ParanthaPerfect Crisp and a perfect taste. For the mains i had ordered chicken korma and they didn’t disappoint me at all. It was tasty and went great with the lachha paranthas. I cannot praise the food enough.

1796,"It's pathetic place. Webooked a new year party event from nearbuy app of Rs 4000. The entire event was pathetically managed ,the place has a capacity of maximum 50 to 60 people however there were 1000 people at the same place. There was no food and drinks available when we went there the place was even worse than a fish market. There was a stampede at the entrance and due to which we lost our mobile phone someone stole it. There were no bouncers so many drunk people were mistreating women , it was so unsafe for  femaled.Itried contacting near buy application customer care however those people were so disgraceful they denied to refund my money. I will never recommend this place to anyone."
1797,"Visited here for a friend's birthday. This place is just awesome. Food, space, dj, everything was up to the mark. The only problem was their service, that may be because of heavy crowd, but otherwise it's worth visiting."
1798,"I have been here twice, and I would definitely love to go here again. It’s one of those places where you can eat and dance your heart out at such an affordable price accompanied with a great ambience. The food here is delicious, the DJ is amazing and the outlet is very spacious, and has a lovely terrace as well. If you want to have a great time without burning a hole in your pocket, this is the place for you. ☺️"

Best hospitality, must visit place if you wanna have a decent and good time with your friends. great job done. cheeersssss."
1803,I visited this place because of its roof top location.I really liked the view of the roof top.  However the mood was soon spoiled by the poor service and pathetic quality of food. The waiters are not ready to attend you. And food taste was really hopeless.I tried nachos which was the worst nachos of my life I have ever tried. The cheese used was of poor quality and it was not worth a single penny. Hakka Noodles was O.K. but it seemed good in compare to nachos. I also ordered mocktail (coco loco) which was also really pathetic.Overall it was total waste of money for me.

This is one of the worst restaurants you can ever go. they don’t have enough staff and the ones they do isn’t worth it.The service is so bad that at one point i thought that they didn’t serve anything you just have to go and fetch your own drinks and food. Like i had to go 4 times to ask them where is my food ?  And the stuff that you order doesn’t come till 30-45 minuets ! Which is totally outrageous!  change the why you do business because you might be ruining someone’s special day ! And if you believe me, take a peak at the reviews.

1808,"Pathetic place. Don't know what the hype is all about. I went there to celebrate my friend's birthday and it was a horrible experience. The service is really disappointing. The whole terrace area had one waiter. We had to wait for 15 mins to get the menu, even when there were no other guests sitting on terrace. After calling the waiter 5-6 times, our order was finally taken. The food took ages to come and was not at all good. We had to wait for 20 mins to get even a glass of water. Not at all going to this place ever again."

1813,V went there to celebrate my fren’s bday. Ambience is quite good but service is really disappointing.. nobody is there to listen to u. Dey dint give matchbox with the cake. V had to wait for 10 mins. Then I called up a waiter and surprisingly he said I don’t have a matchbox. Very bad experience. They don’t know how to behave with their customers..
1814,"I have given this rating only for the sake of ambience and food...if you talk about service, pathetic service, extremely rude and ignorant staff..."
1815,PATHETIC SERVICE!I literally waited for 15 minutes for someone to come and take my order but no one attended. There wasn’t even much crowd still all the staff was just standing on the counter and not receiving us.Worst experience ever!
1816,A total value for money.. Just loved their Paneer Lababdar & Dahi kebab. Must visit this place if you are looking for some change or for a rooftop lounge.
1817,Good ambience and great music. Hygenic place and well mannered staff is the key. I would recommend the young crowd to try this place atleast once.

The outlet is very well conceptualised, i liked the terrace seating more suited for the weather these days. A suggestion sit on the terrace if u want to enjoy slow music and long talks. If u want a more party type ambiance its advisable to sit in the lounge area. First things first, even though it was a zomato Gold outlet, i was denied the gold offer.

The lounge doesn't have a dancing space if all people in the lounge come together to dance, there probably will be a stampede. But this place is a heaven for all the sheesha lovers, as you can try different varieties of sheesha.

I am not an expert on hookahs but i haven't ever experienced this happening so i was kind of confused about that. Anyway they had to take that one away.

1844,Ambience and food here is the best. Great place to hangout with your gang. If you need to celebrate any occasion this place for you man. Enjoyed everything here and music too ;) 
1845,"Currently sitting here with my fiancee. Ordered  cheese bread and french fries, coke, and Nojito. Service is terrible. Had to ask for tissue paper. Being served with flat coke ( no fizz) ! I returned it and again m being greeted with same damn flat coke. Unhappy with the current experience."
1846,"This place is might is Good and small in size, Roof looks attractive in pictures but dont have anything like in reality. Food was fine we tried veg plater, Chiken malai tikka, pasta all fine, but DAL makhni was yuk and burned. DJ was nit available 5 to 8 pm. But Service was very very very slow. I many time asked for control AC temperature because we were feeling hot inside.Ambience 4/5Service     1/5Food        3/5Temperature 3/5"
1847,Take off scarlet also known as TOS is spread over two floors. One is the indoor seating one on the third floor and the other one is the outdoor open air seating one on the forth floor. The roof top seating has a great ambience to enjoy the food on a good weather day. Totally loved the food they served. The ambience was good and the outlet is capable of giving cut to cut compitition to all the surrounding outlets. They have a very dim light ambience on the third floor. The dj plays good tracks for us to completly enjoy our food and chill.
1848,"A great place sit and chill with your buddies i would say. Not that easier to locate though if you are coming for the first time. It’s opposite Starbucks.About the food- Fresh and tasted great. I visited during the lunch hours for Dineout Eaternship event. Had tasted Veg Manchurian and Honey Chilly Potatoes in particular which tasted a lot better than many cafes in Delhi.Nice ambiance, good to catch up with friends after a long time and talk."
1849,Great ambience and interiors with good quality food and a pretty nice service. A good place with a great ambience. They have appealing interiors and nice seating for a party with friends. The service is pretty good and also the food is tasty and attractive. It's worth visiting. The liquor is a bit expensive though but the food is great. 
1850,Best place and the ambience totally awesome. This was my first time here and noe from onwards it will be countless. I am loving this place 😍
1851,"I went to this place last week with my friends. The place is good and spacious; nice place to hang out with friends. First of all we ordered white sauce pasta, drums of heaven, spring rolls, nachos, honey chilly potato, dahi kebab, hookah and some drinks. Spring rolls were not good as it was oily. Rest of the starters were tasty. We all spent a good time there and then we ordered main course. So we had biryani, paneer lababdar and garlic naan. Overall we enjoyed the dinner."
1852,"Went to this place some days ago, and guess whom did I meet. The one and only Arjun Rampal, promoting for his movie. This place has an awesome food if you are fan of non vegetarian north indian food. Hookah here is super super awesome. It doesnt hit your throat and stays for like alot long period. Food- 5.0Ambience- 4.5Ventilation-4.5Crowd- 4.5"
1853,Great ambience with very much friendly staff.      The food was delicious and tasty. The music and dj was good with good music.  Also there is ample space for siting and dance.  Also it has reasonable rates with good quality
1854,great place for enjoy .... cheap and best place in punjabi bagh🍺 food and drinks worthfull🍺music👌crowd👌it has a great atmosphere.....
1855,"The worst place to be if you want to spoil ur evening you are most welcome to visit the place.Went here Went wq week poor service a beer bucket took. 30 mins to com felt like he had actually got it brewed and bottled fresh and got it for us.... As far as snacks were considered chicken Malai Tikka was half done and upon calling the manager he says u don't know how Tikka are to which I was like ""yes bro visiting restaurants or lounges for the first time in my life"" Poor attitude screwed up service even won't feel like providing 1 rating to them... "
1856,"The lounge has great ambience & a dj is mostly available to play all your favourite music to dance on. Also, a photographer is ready on his toes to click some good photos of you. The food is average & I personally didn't like the drinks. The main course was better than starters & butter chicken was the best among all. So try this place out for good music but not for food."

FoodFood is average. I liked d mocktails. ServiceService is average.They have their personal photographer n I liked their picture quality.Overall experiencePlace is for youngster s who wants to lounge around but not a place to go with family. 
1871,This place is awsm.I luv it😘.It's service is tremendous.Nice place to pass the tym . Location is also very god and the crowd there is also nice . Food is also delicious😋😋
1872,Best place with One of the best interiors ❤😍 service too good ❤panner Tikka is so delicious 💯 Dj is damn awesome 💯 love to visit again ❤ 
1873,Delicious food.. Interior is the best.  Service is absolutely fine. Prices are reasonable. The best lounge in punjabi bagh. (sahil jafri)  must visit
1874,Best place for party lover. Sheesha lover will definitely love this place.. interior are the best and food served are delicious. This place will never disappoint you. Affordable and good service. Coming again soon. 
1875,"Very very poor service and rude staff so quit table in start only,The service was terrible....music was extremely loud. The waiters were least interested in serving ...very bad experience..will not go again..Rating is fake.. Please avoid it... Poor food..no availablity of diet Coke even on prior discussion ,,, normal Coke totally flat .....😒😒 menu change by its own ..."
1876,Good place to chill in Punjabi Bagh with great ambiance.food is descent but music is greatWould recommend people to visit this place.hukka is good😂
1877,Visited first time and got an Amazing experience ❤️ Awesome ambience.. Food was amazing.. Services are good.. Sound of the music was upto the mark.. Rest everything is Perfect💯
1878,"Rating only for food. Cheesy cigar rolls, chilli chicken, chilli paneer, dahi ke kabab were good. Ambience was good. Customer service was not good. Waited 20 mins till we gave the order. More room for improvement in servicing department. "
1879,I went this place for my birthday dinner party with my family .The food was average but service was very poor.During the dinner we ordered next breads but after 20 minutes we got the breads. There was no system for delivery of food on the tables.I got first time experience of so bad service.
1880,"Pathetic place...completely ruined the Saturday night mood...below average service..we had to ask for plates and fork to be served. To top it all, the pizza they served had some thread type stuff hanging from it...disgusting. We paid and left the place "
1881,Ambience is very good... i liked the snacks....though main course was bit let down for me. mocktails was average  . I wanted to give 3 star but i gave one extra just for ambience.
1882,"So today i went to this cafe and seriously i would recommend this place as its ambience would be rated not less than 4/5 Atmosphere was cool enough inside.Apart from ambience their food tastes well and good.We ordered Paneer Tikka Pizza(thin crust), Tandori Platter, Tawa Chaap and Dal Makhni along with some breads and trust me they tasted really good. Pizza and Tawa chaap tastes the best out of which i ordered. I dont know why people talk about its late service as i didn't felt anything like that. Service was good enough. So i would rate service and food both 4/5. This would be enough for this place and yes this cafe is a once must visit types."
1883,"Just one word come to my mind when i talk about TOS ""PATHETIC"". The staff is so rude and arrogant they really don't know how to manage things...It took them 20 minutes to get me a glass of water (after asking for it twice). We wasted our time and money at this wretched place. "
1884,I went to the place for the first time after so much of hype. My cousins were after my life to take them to the place. So finally we went but it was the bad decision for us. The place was very dull and interior was also not good. We sat for 20-25 min and no one came to even ask for water and we decided to left the place.
1885,The place is pathetic and so is the place. Never ever visit this place. I guess McDonald's serves better food. Waste of money and time. I guess even 1 star is more for this place. 
1886,The Place Is So Damn Good That I Had My 2 Birthdays Consequtively Here🤘But The Place So Shady And DJ is so Damn Good 😍Best Place For Foodie and Hookha Lovers 🤘
1887,Bar downstairs way too noisy and congested but the terrace was lovely.  Nice and clean sitting area. They offer a decent menu of drinks and food and decently priced too. We ordered a soft drink and a a beer so can't say anything about drinks. Had their special pizza which was Nice. Good service nice ambience.. So they get a heads up from us. We will be back. 
1888,Food was amazing. 💕 Ambience was also good and service was also fine.🎀 The only problem was music was bit loud.🤷🏻‍♀️Rest everything was perfect. 💕
1889,"TOS is one of the best places to visit in punjabi bagh. Situated on the most famous club road, TOS has gained such an amazing reputation in 1 year that other competitors working from past so many years aren't able to get. The food is simply amazing and economical, just lags a quantity issue. The best hookah in town from hookah craft serves hookah here😍. Moreover, it TOS has all the major cocktail brands and it serves them in the most reasonable prices. Just a suggestion, always do go by prior reservations, otherwise, getting a table becomes a tough task especially on weekends."
1890,Went last night with family and friends.Found very loud place.Interior was ok sitting was pretty comfortable.Open space was good.Food was awesome 4.5/5 except Dal makhani.Just the management issue was there no service boy was alinged we have to get up many times to call service boy for order.The vellet boy countinously on call.And the hygiene part washroom was near to kitchen which is open and you can see chef's are working without chef coat and cap which was really a hygiene issue. Management need to think on it.Small things make big impression.3 is just for this mismanagement and hygiene part.Rest I could prefer to give 4.
1891,"TOS is definitely a must visit place if you are looking for a great place to chill and party with your friends and family. Starting with their ambience, it's amazing and they even have a very beautiful terrace where you can click great pictures. Coming to their menu, they offer a variety of delicious meals. We ordered chicken wings bbq and virgin mojito. Both tasted just tooo good. This is a great place for hookah lovers too. TOS special hookah is the best as per my opinion."
1892,"Lovely place, great infrastructure. You can easily spot the lounge from the road. Quick service and smiling staff. Spacious dance floor and delicious food. Definitely worth going."
1893,Reasonable PriceGood foodGood MusicGood ServiceWhat else do you wantA good place to hangout if you are in Punjabi Bagh!Terrace at this place is just a bliss!
1894,good   food crowd was nice everything was good but service is slow can be better staff arrangement is nedd to be good DJ was was excelent bpah blah blag
1895,Service is worst. Half of the dishes are not there. Worst experience with any of the lounges in punjabi bagh. Dj also not up to the mark. Just interior is okay. Services are 0
1896,"Good looking and nice ambiance, I like this place,  good food and friendly staff,  very enjoyment place for young generation.. Thanks for management "
1897,"Was strolling down with cousins and wanted to have drinks and we headed to the place known as TOS by all.. 3 stags and they had no problem with that as many dont let stags in as raftaar..Anyhow they had a live band performing that night and was filled with families enjoying themselves..The lightings were a bit on a dark side..We sat and ordered dahi kebabs and some cheese nachos with some beers... the band was quite good so were the kebabs.. The ambience was good but the lightings were a bit shady i felt and the restrooms were smelly enuf to turn you off..If you guys are looking for a affordable place, can give it a shot.."
1898,"Take off Scarlet or also well known as TOS is a casual dining place situated in Punjabi Bagh. The place is spread over 2 floor seating: one being covered and another terrace. The terrace is my fav part, beautifully designed. And would be apt for a nice evening.Expect a lot of school/college group crowd with hindi/punjabi loud music. And too dim lighting.The staff was courteous, but there was a lot of delay in service :(What all I had! Pasta: White and Mix sauce pasta. Though bith of them were quite creamy but the taste was too bland.Pizza: Had paneer pizza, which was topped with many veggies but the crust was too crispyVeg Platter: The platter has a good variety of items. And...read more"
1899,"Worst service i have ever seen...food was bad... please don't waste yours money and time...hookah  was good............,........................"
1900,Ultimate place for weekend .. specially the sheshaaa nd food a great variety of chicken starters nd drinks... visit oncee and uh ll make sure to visit again . 
1901,I went fr a bday party here...I would rate the things i tried here:Non veg tandoori platter 8/10White sauce Pasta 9/10 (it did not had salt)Manchurian 10/10Nachos 9/10The hukka was great...And i loved the ambience...comfortable seating and extremely great service...Lovely music and one of the most affordable place in town...A must visit 😍
1902,they need to improve their hooka and their services too staff were not concerned about the visitors and whatever we have odered was not available . they only got big hookas with noo smoke. we requested them several times for smoke but they didnt respond meanwhile their dj was comparatively good and it didnt disappointed
1903,"Just an ok place with the shittiest attitude manager ever. Went their to celebrate a friend's birthday and got out on time before it got ruined. To start with in this sweltering Delhi heat these people didn't have cold water 😒 when asked why, nobody had a clue. When requested the manager for some tissues the reply was 'bhej to rahe hai, itni kya jaldi hai'. Guys avoid this place at all costs."
1904,"the place really is running on its goodwill. poor management skills, on top the staff is the snobbiest and food is best described as low mediocre. the only saving grace is the location and other eateries getting sold out and overflow coming to this place. "
1905,"Amazing food,drinks and ambience.Must visit this place on Saturday night because of live music and dj.I really liked the drinks here.The taste and quality of the food was great."
1906,A good decent place in Punjabi. Lovely interiors.. A perfect terrace to get your pictures.! Coming to food. Pizza is lip smacking. Pasta was a hitChilly potato bang on Not too convinced with the main course though. Very very average. Overall a good experience. 
1907,"First of All, this place has a great ambience. You must have heard alot about this place but it doesnt stand to it's name. The service was very slow. Never the less this place is okayish in punjabi bagh. You can give it a try, cheers."
1908,"Ambience, food, crowd, great service and most importantly fun you will get everything here. They do listen to you and the service is good. The only thing they are lacking is the food quantity."
1909,The ambiance was alright the food most definitely could have been better .The food took way too long to prepare . But at the end of the day mocktails were the highlight of the evening
1910,"It was really a good experience, the ambience was good secondly the food and the shesha was Amazing but the staff is not co-operative muchh the service is quite slow! Dance floor is good!"
1911,"This is my first experience of how bad trying a new place can be , after reading the reviews i made up my mind to celebrate my bday here but it was a mistake . First of all the confirmation of seating area was done on zomato but later on when you try make the manager understand the same he denies that no booking has been done , even after showing him message we received , moreover the management was not at all helpful. When asked about the deals they promised on phone they denied we cannot give you that , we tried to order tandoori momos they didn't have them and also there is a combo available for 999 but they said they cannot give that when asked why they didn't say anything and the...read more"
1912,"Pathetic service was what I could witness here at Take Off Scarlett. They're not at all bothered about getting the orders delivered. An hour it had been, we kept on sitting and waiting for our order. If you guys cannot manage crowd. Better shut down."
1913,"Not a very good experience. The ambience was untidy with curry spilled menu. The staff and service were really poor. Food quality was not upto the mark. Ordered chicken 65 and found a stone crackling between my teeth. On asking for replacement of the item, we were served the same chicken in another dish. Pathetic experience. Would not recommend to anyone. "
1914,"So, I went here on the reccomendation of friend who apparently knows the owner. I didn't try out the place but, i am writing this review out of spite really, as i walked into the place, the electricity was gone and it stayed gone for the 20 minutes I stayed there before deciding to leave the place. And, during this time, no one approached us to tell us what happened and i didn't wanna risk getting hurt so didn't searching around for people either. So, that's basically the entirety of my experience there. So, the rooftop which does appear to be fancy, is off limits because of government orders so that takes the fun out of it. "
1915,Ambience was good. We order paneer Tikka and biryani which was so delicious. However service is too slow it took 45mins for them to serve a hookah. 
1916,"TOS is a reasonable place for anyone in town. Vegetarian food was good however non vegetarian was sent back by us on the account of being too salty. The same was re-served and was much better then.The wine was highly substandard and should be missed in order to retain a good experience there.The setup and ambience were pleasing and the band, imzaa, was just amazing! If not for anything else, I'll surely revisit for the band"
1917,Take of scarlet very well know as Tos..  Located on the punjabi bagh club road. A very good place to chill out. Nice view from the roof top area. A very quick service and serving so fresh food with delicious taste. The pasta is just finger licking .
1918,'Worth a Visit'.. must try tos special manchurian dry! Staff is co-operative. And yess this place has a beautiful roof top sitting as well as indoor.. Ambience is good :) 
1919,"Amazing food... Amazing ambience...seesha a must try, Worth a visit😍❤️Loved the service.... Given total attention Would live to visit here. "
1920,My experience in Tos was very good.....one thing that jumps out is their ambience and service.....food was ok....had a great experience.with my friends.....for a party animal... recommended
1921,"It's a nice place to hangout with friends. Service is not so good but the ambience is quite good. Seating arrangement is awesome. Staff is quite friendly, the background music is good it matches with ambience. "
1922,Wost cafe woth worst serviceCold pasta order coming after 30 minHukkah came after 40 min even after they brought different flavourThey dont know how to behave
1923,"Experiencing the worst ever dining..Worst service..Average foodNd mainly ""worst interaction""They have No anwsers for questions..""Worst ever""Will not recommended anyone"
1924,Its good and the staff is very good and frank too and the captain jeetu is so helpful and he treat people differently by others he listen to the people exactly what they want and the dj is good he knkw what the crowd want to listen 
1925,The food was really delicious and hookah was really well made. Though we just had LIIT but it was not up to the standards. Ambience was nice and good songs were played. They even played songs on request. Overall a good experience 
1926,"Take off Scarlett an amazing party plce with huge sitting and a huge terrace. Interiors are fab so the decor. Ambience and services are good with huge bar. Sheesha is amazing. Food is also amazing. A proper party place. I order chilly paneer, honey chilli potato, pasta etc all were delicious and good in taste. Presentations if food are good. "
1927,"Take off Scarlet, Popularly knows as TOS is an amazing place located bang opposite to Wok in the clouds. Parking is not that much chaotic that you may find ahead on the club road.Place is a huge one with a dance floor, A Terrace and lounge area which you may use for your personal parties. Try theirs amazing tall sheesha and cocktails. Didnt eat much as the appetite was for good drinks because of such amazing taste. Do try their LIIT and whisky sour.Would be coming soon to try some more!"
1928,"Great Ambiance,Staff,Food. Really enjoyed allot here.Great service by Mr. Jitender k singh .He was excellent in serving us.Do contact him whenever you visit TOS. Must Visit this place if you are looking for chillaxing in Punjabi Bagh !!"

1932,"Take off Scarlet , commonly said as TOS is great place to hangout and chill. This place has a beautiful open rooftop seating and indoor is also there. They serve good food ."
1933,"Take off scarlet (TOS), at club road punjabi bagh is a must-go place if you're nearby. This place has an amazing variety of food hookah drinks and what not. They have the best dance floor and dj. They provide you a photographer which is an amazing add on to the awesomness of this place. Love it. xoxo"
1934,"Located on the main Punjabi Bagh market road, Take off Scarlet indeed is a gem amongst the hustle bustle of lots of restaurants in the area. Serving multiple cuisines it caters to the diverse palates and doesn’t leave you disappointed at all.The ambience is comparatively dark with loud music, so you can be assured that you’ll want to shake those legs for sure. Separately, there is a beautiful terrace if you want to enjoy rainy or cold weathers.As I was part of a big group, I got an opportunity to try many dishes and my favorite ones have to be –STARTERSChicken TikkaChilli ChickenFish FingersMAINSMakhani PaneerMutton RoganjoshPaneer LababdarFinally, I would happily...read more"
1935,"The most unprofessional place i have ever been to. Booked the place for 15 people on a Saturday night by contacting a person named Kashish who seemed like a great guy, but eventually disappointed. Went to check out the place 2 days before my event and spoke to the manager named Saurabh. He kept trying to convince me for the terrace area, to which i clearly denied and let him speak to Kashish whom i spoke earlier. He said there is a party of approx 100 people and i clearly mentioned that i don't mind that. So it was decide that these guys will give me the space which i wanted amd not the terrace.

1936,"The place is a must go.Be it the ambience, food, hukka , photography, everything is upto the mark.Very nice place.Worth the money.In the heart of club road, punjabi bagh, its location is perfect."
1937,"With good food, superb music and phenomenal ambiance, this is one of the most happening places in West Delhi. Must visit with dear and near ones!"
1938,"One of the best club/pub in town. The ambience is classic style and luxurious. The high point of the restaurant are the Hookahs which are prepared with perfection. All flavours are available and the service is awesome. In the food I tried the starters with Chicken Tikka, it was perfectly cooked with the right texture and just melted in the mouth. I also ordered the Chicken drumsticks. They were juicy and delicious.  The pizzas are also a highlight and I tried the chicken pizza. The crust was crisp and the toppings were perfectly cooked. It was delicious. In the drinks I ordered a watermelon mojito. It was refreshing with a slight kick of vodka in it. In the main course I ordered the...read more"
1939,Perfect place for partying.. From food to ambiance to dj everything is just perfect. Had an amazing experience. Highly reccomended. Must visit 
1940,"As the is name is sounds like a lavish lounge / restaurant dosent have that feel .it is based on some roman concept but the place is dark , food was good but the quantity was way to much less , they surprised us with cold coffee which dosent have ice cream in it light in taste and costed us ike around 200 something , not trying this lounge / restaurant again ."
1941,"Went for a party to TOS and had an exceptional experience. Tried a lot of dishes and enjoyed each of them. Tried chilly paneer, pizza and chicken tikka along with some refreshing mocktails. The ambiance and staff too is perfect for a nice and laid back evening experience. Must visit, when around."
1942,"This place is pure beauty when it comes to hosting deadly hardcore parties in this area. Since they have covered their customers wishes to fine dining, Terrace is lounge area will do for the greater party animals. The food has never been a concern here and you know that is why the customers drop in for a dine dining lunch or dinner. But what to do for party goers, no worries since lounge has been particularly designed for them. Even people who are why seems shaking their hips here for the ear tearing dj. Few cocktails inside you see yourself nowhere but on the dance floor making moves for their dj beats."
1943,"If you don't expect anything extra ordinary, then Take off Scarlet has it all to fulfill the demands of the punjabi bagh crowd. Loud music with DJ, a kick rooftop, flawless hukkas by hukka craft and well prepared north Indian dishes. Apart from that I equally enjoyed the chilli chicken and LIITs made my eve even better. My advice to drool over their cocktails and chakna and keep enough space for the main course. The Setting is impressive and even in the brightest days, they convert it into dazzling club. A bit more on the service and they deserve a place among the top 3 places in punjabi bagh.  "
1944,"Just went here for the first time and it was so yummy! The atmosphere is great, the food was awesome, and our server was very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend!"
1945,The place has awesome ambience and great food. The service is a bit slow but overall the place is good. Prices are reasonable and quality is good. 
1946,"Situated in Punjabi bagh on club road. It's one best place to enjoy with your frends with good food and music.

1949,"Take off scarlet is a place with mystic ambiance with both indoor and outdoor seating available.this place has awesome music, Hukka and great food available which makes it the absolute party lounge in Punjabi bagh, club road.Dahi ke kabab and chilly chicken were two of my favourite dishes here.Also i tried paneer lababdaar, dal makhni and naan which were amazingggg.For non vegetarians, meat biriyani and butter chicken were just perfection.The ambiance, good bollywood music and ofcourse good food makes it stand out among other places in west Delhi."
1950,"TOS is the one-stop-lounge perfect for those chilled out parties with friends. My personal favorite is their spacious, airy rooftop as opposed to their dimly lit indoor seating. Being located on Club Road is a huge plus point for them as it helps in drawing crowds. I was here last week and tried a few of their food and beverages. Contrary to popular belief, their food is also capable of taking the brand to places and not just Hookah. My favorites include their Tomato Basil Bruschetta, Dahi Ke Kebab and Drums of Heaven in Starters, Dal Makhni and TOS Spl Butter Chicken in Main Course, and Shahi Tukda in Desserts. TOS is an ideal place for driving away those Monday Blues or...read more"
1951,"Take Off Scarlet is one of the happening party places in Punjabi Bagh and I happened to be here last week. TOS is located at a prime location that is Club Road and spans across two floors. It is the quintessential sundowner place with an aesthetic, spacious terrace, though it has an overall dimly lit ambiance with an in-house DJ playing the latest musical hits. Also, being a lounge, it is obvious that liquor and Hookah would be freely available. They have quite a few mannequins and bottled lights working in favor of their decor and ambiance. TOS is marketing themselves as a lounge and party place, but it scores quite nicely as far as the food being served is concerned too. Service...read more"
1952,It's a nice club and bar in Punjabi Bagh. The djay is the finest and the ambience is perfect. Best place to hangout with fam. And friends. The food is very good 😊 must visit once.❤️👅💫
1953,"Take off Scarlett is the best economical lounge available in Punjabi Bagh. With an option to dine on roof top or with covered space with loud music, this place has everything a lounge needs to have.Service was not very smooth here and you have to poke atleast 3-4 times on a busy day.For drinks I had Chocolate overdose shake - Mixed well were the two different kinds of chocolate with milk and served in a huge glass.For starters I'd recommend• Chilli chicken - Hot chicken pieces which cannot go wrong at any time of life.Chicken Malai tikka - Served in a pan, 4-5 pieces of Creamy chicken breasts best with drinks.For mainsDal makhani was the best as it was not too heavy and...read more"
1954,Service is very poor. There is no professionalism in the staff..!! Quantity of food is also not much.!!Waste of time.! It's not worthy.! 👎
1955,Well the place is really good for party animals full dj on with some lipsmacking food. Tried chicken malai tikka in starters and in mains we had dal makhani and mutton rogan josh with laccha parantha. Try this place if you are looking for some party place in punjabi bagh.
1956,"One of the best party place of youngster in west delhi,  it is dark and lovely place where you can party with your friends. Was here with my 10 friends and we order couple of cocktail and beer along with hukkah. They serve one of the best hukkah by hukkah by craft so we enjiyed our hukkah very much. In food i had Chilly chicken it was nice and spicy And also i had honey chilly potatoes. Chicken malai tilka was also juciy and flavorful In main course i had Rogan Josh it was perfectly cooked spices was perfect. Daal makhani was perfectly cooked too. In dessert i had brownie with ice creamOverall i enjoyed here very much with my friends. "
1957,It was a rooftop birthday party but was surely not satisfying. The snacks were not warm and the place was a bit messy. Only few dishes taste good  and rest were ok. They should organise in a better way to have more customers and spread positive word of mouth
1958,"Amidst the hub of restaurants, Take Off Scarlet is a classy lounge situated in Punjabi Bagh on the club road, serving sumptuous food, interesting drinks and smoky sheeshas.I visited it with my friends last week and We totally relished our meal. The ambience is welcoming and the Dj plays some great numbers wanting you to shake a leg.Coming to the food and drinks we ordered for-• WATERMELON MOJITO- Perfect cooler for the scorching heat.• CHICKEN MALAI TIKKA- was soft and tender and well marinated.• SOYA CHAP- succulent pieces in mildly spiced marination.• MUTTON ROGAN JOSH- loved the gravy.

1960,"Another beautiful addition to the gems of Club road, Punjabi Bagh : ""Take off Scarlet"" with an enigmatic name is actually ruling the ramp. Delicious food, Groovy music, Fantastic hookahs and Mystique ambience, and do you want more? I wish they did not have to shut their rooftop because it was so damn gorgeous. Music, though a tad loud for me, is enjoyable. The flickering lights, on the top, dazzles the mood. What I liked & recommend: -ChiChi (a vodka based cocktail with pineapple and coconut)-Fish fingers - Chicken Lollipop-Paneer Tikka Sunhari -Makhani Paneer ✅-Keema Curry Pizza  ✅-Chicken Biryani !! "

1962,"Last Sunday I visited this place for a lunch with my friends. I like their roof top seating.In the starters we ordered Mushrooms and cheese malted, Dahi keep kebab, chilli chicken, Drums of heaven and Murgh malai tikka. Chilli chicken and Murgh malai tikka were good and must for every visitor.In drinks we had tutti fruity and watermelon cooler. Watermelon cooler Was good in this hot summer of Delhi.In main course we ordered paneer lababdar, Dal makhani and butter chicken. Paneer lababdar was good and have thick gravy which makes it more delicious.To end our lunch, in dessert we ate brownie with ice cream. Which was as usual good in taste."
1963,"Last week we got a chance to visit this beautiful and amazing place in Punjabi bagh known as “TOS”. Take Off Scarlet is a chilled out lounge in Punjabi Bagh with yummy food, a wide bar selection & awesome shisha. They also have a great rooftop. (But avoid it in summers 😛 ). Rooftop is perfect for when the weather is playing nice."
1964,"In the hub of multiple restaurants one can easily figure out TAKE OFF SCARLETT, stands as TOS, we were planning a meet up, me and my friends in punjabi bagh, and rather than going for some big names there we tried a place new to us TOS!Half of our group was vegan and half non vegetarian, so finding out a place that serves good food in both genre is always a challenge, but m glad we made the decision to visit this place, cause food was the best! To begin with we ordered:#MUSHROOM AND CHEESE MALTED: It was divine, the best thing to go for in veg, the bread was loaded with genuine amount of fresh cheese filled with mushroom!

Spread over two floors- one being indoor sitting and other being a nicely done terrace. Coming to the sitting at their 3rd floor:. Because of the hot weather, we decided to seat ourselves at the 3rd floor!!"
1966,"This place is located in the city Punjabi Bagh. Such as wonderful experience, been last week. Simply awesome place to visit with good food and presentation. Staff is well groomed and courteous with pleasant service. Ambience is nice awesome terrace theme simply loved it and will be visiting here frequently."

1969,Went there for a friend's birthday celebration. They didn't have a refrigerator where we could keep the cake to chill. The water served was warm. The staff is rude as well and they seem to be proud about it. Left the place in 10 minutes. 
1970,"Honey chilli potato ,chicken lollypop and sheesha was amazing😍❤Night life with  proper ambience and decor was also good!Atmosphere and the crowed was also co orporative"
1971,Half of the items on the menu were not available. The service was also slow. Advice-check what's there in the menu first before deciding what you want to order. We almost ordered 5-7 items that were not there ( both food and drinks combined)Ambience is nice and food was good as well.Funny was that it was a live music night. The musician just sang literally three songs and went.Very average!
1972,"The place is good but Quite dark at times! Although ambience is soothing and good young crowd with having steps on the floor. I specially like interiors and there are lots of options to choose from in the Menu! If you want Dance , food , ambience and Fun then it's perfect for you!"
1973,"Ambience of this place is really good with superb interior.. .. you all can enjoy with your friends here. A nice place to party with friends, recently been there with my friends. Ambience is very nice with cool interior and proper lighting. Musice was also good just a bit loud I can say. I ordered BBQ chicken it was quite good......but service was little bit slow.... overall it was good experience......."
1974,"TOS located on the busy road of Punjabi Bagh Club Road is a huge lounge spread on two floors , one is indoor and the other is magnificent terrace . You will fall in love with the ambience it is that  beautiful 😍Hookah craft's hookah are being served here and they are super as always .Food is yummy . Love their pizzas , chicken tikka and  dal makhni 😍Not to forget the super amazing crowd and party atmosphere of this place on Saturday night . Must visit."
1975,Went here on Saturday night.it was filled with stag Who were binge drinking like retards.would never go this place again and dull ambience made things more pathetic.
1976,"The service was disappointing. Not polite and friendly. The food was okay. The sheesha and drinks were good. The ambience was also nice. The dj was impressive. But with so many options on Club road, they really need to up their game."
1977,Pathetic service! Been here twice and both the times service was below average.The staff is too rude and you will have to call them for every little thing because they keep forgetting one thing or the other.The place only has good interiors.Just an over rated place!
1978,The New Hookahs at tos is something straight from south delhi to west delhi with a very perfect and smooth experience. Must Try the Sheesha here ❤️
1979,"TOS is quite famous right now.Honestly, I just dont see why. The owners really need to pay attention to what is happening at their place, the staff is literally ripping them off. Not a good place if u ask me."
1980,"A nice place to party with friends, recently been there with my friends. Ambience is very nice with cool interior and proper lighting. Musice was also good just a bit loud I can say. In the food we ordered bbq chicken and chicken tikka pizza, both were good. Second we ordered pesto pasta that was okayish but murg tikka hajari was a bit off. Service is also good. Coming soon again to try some more."
1981,"Was there for my sibling's birthday party. astounding perspective , stunning sustenance and hookah. patio is more excellent than anything. delighted in alot :)"
1982,"Food good, ambiance nice, interiors nice, sheesha great with good servicing. Average cost for two including a pint 1100 approximately. One should visit at least once, a good experience. "
1983,"Very good place to dine in with reasonable rates.tge food is very good ,but for some items quantity is less.The pizza seemed smaller than it should be.Apart from this its a very good place."
1984,"The place is huge, has good lighting, and the interiors are classic. The pub was full, even in the afternoon.Food:Veg pizza was good, full of cheese, but the base was a bit on the dry side.Red sauce pasta was delicious. Spring Rolls were equally good. Murga Malai Tikka wasn't that convincing. The chicken was chewy and the taste ok-ish. Chicken 65 was better than the former. Overall, the starters didn't impress me.The mocktails were refreshing. Pink Panther is recommended.Coming to the main course, Dal Makhni was one of the best I've had in recent times. It was cooked perfectly, full of cream and the taste was heavenly. A must-try. Paneer Lababdar was equally good, if not...read more"
1985,"Food here is okay, the ambience is quite nice. I went here for a party, the music was really really REALLY loud that i couldn't hear anything properly for the next 2 days. 😂 The service was excellent though. The staff was friendly and trying hard to get everyone everything they wanted. "
1986,Okay music was very loud :p but all over the place is amazing 😍 I liked dahi kebab and red sauce pastaBut chilly potatoes were average.Dance floor is okay.
1987,This place used to be better than what it is now. The hukkah was okay and pasta was average simply could get better in small cafes. The chilly chicken was bit more of sweet than highlighting the flavour with a bit of stretchy chicken piece
1988,Service is seriously too poor. Ambience and food is awesome but what would be use of all excellent things if the service is poor and slow. Even i told the waiters that i would pay you extra if u give us good service still of no use. 
1989,"One of best rooftop ⛱ lounge and bar in punjabi bagh 👌After school farewell we decided to have a after party at take off scarlet So we were around 30 people And we had one of the best sheesha ( rs 800 tax included ) till 😋 not even sheesha but also crispy honey chilli potato and white sauce pasta was just amazingAnd Good music🔃 ambience !! But the only problem we face was that the waiter took more than half an hour to serve us our sheesha 😔 and we had to remind him again and again to make it fast 🤔 !! Service is slow!! We had a good time at take off scarletBut overall it is must visit place 😇 !! Please like , comment and follow me "
1990,We went to this place on the recommendation of one of my friend n i found this place complete boring.. :/ service was not good n the food too...  Place just spoiled everything thing.. they made mistakes in billing as well..  Please don't visit this place ever.

1992,Like the same every other place in Punjabi Bagh. TOS has its  own ambience but the food in particular is not worth spending for drinks are okay nothing special you can always visit it for good music and hookah
1993,I m a frequent visitor.It's a great place tobe at. One cannot find any sort of issue in the kind of food served or beverages. The ambience is enhanced by the efficient and fast service. Do ask for dinesh. Hes always there for you :)
1994,"Very gud service by Suraj and manager mukul best hookah and.   Best .........................................................., food.           9718863979"

1996,The #tos is one of my favorites sisha and food are totally enchante but sadly the make us wait for literally half an hour the staff are not that much active so my ratings are broken becoz of servicing punchuality.
1997,Great ambience with amazing theme and rooftop cafe is really good. Nice food and rates are also not that high for a place like this. Great staff and amazing service art.

2008,"The worst place in Punjabi. Request people to avoid this place. Things which are wrong with Take off Scarlet:1) More than half of the items on the menu are not available or if they are available the staff doesn't want to serve them2) The staff is untrained with no clue about hospitality. Waiters don't know anything about the menu and the management has the most callous attitude I have ever seen. Nobody knows how to serve the customers3) In the evening the staff behaved as if they were intoxicated with absolute don't-care attitude 3) They operate on "" Customer is definitely not the king"" motto.

2010,"Nice ambiance,just a fine place , Servicing was really impressive, ask out for mr suraj who takes good care of hospitality and the very amazing cocktail by Mr.  pushkar.Food is nice, the very famous dahi kebab is a must try, chilli potatoes is an ok ok and the most recommended for cheese lovers is CHEESE ROLL CIGAR. main course offers kadhai paneer which is delicious.The good thing about this place is that you can dance eat and drink all day over here."
2011,"Enjoyed excellent service and food at tos, the place is awesome, we had exellent mocktails and cocktails there, staff was very polite and they look after our table nicely, amazing hookah with great smoke, last but not the least Mr Mukul was very nicely handled us during our party"
2012,"Absolute 3rd class food quality. I ordered a Margherita pizza. It had no pizza sauce inside. Next, was a 3rd grade alfredo penne pasta. No cheese, no mayonnaise. Just milk and pasta was uncooked. My friend ordered a non veg burger which took over 20 minutes to serve. Finally, the bill processing software was incorrect. They tried to loot us with incorrect calculation of tax. Please people, don't visit this place ever in your life. Absolute worthless shit."
2013,"Went last Thurday over there to celebrate my b'day n it was the worst experience😏😏Apart from Kingfisher Ultra No Beer was available , Tooti Frooti shake was not availabe asked for Orange Hookah they sent some other flavour hookah food was okay service was pathetic😏😏 If i have to rate this lounge so i will not cause they dont deserve any rating but i have to rate 1.0 cause the review will not get submitted 😏😏 Will suggest no one to visit this lounge as they cheat their customer in bills😏😏😏😏 "
2014,"Have an amazing experience every time i visit this place. The food is nice but could me better with some improvements. The dj is really good however it stops quite early. Chanchal bhaiya served us well on time, and attended to us for most of the time. He recommended us with good food pairings too. "
2015,"Ambience is sufficiently good, but service is not upto the mark. The rooftop area, however, is beautifully set up. As far as food is concerned, it tastes fine but not very good. My personal experience was not pretty well so the rating is just for the decor."
2016,Bad Bad bad place. Looks big with great Hospitality but it's just the opposite. Food was decent but the ambience was too dark. Could see school students partying and smoking. 
2017,"TOS-went today for lunch..ambience was good but the staff was not trained..take lot time to serve the order..i ordered cheese garlic bread, punjabi soya chaap ,farm veggie pizza..all tasted gud except pizza..it was the worst pizza i ever ate in my life...music was awesome..must try place specially for terrace lovers😊"
2018,My first impression and experience was not good at all but my perception changed last weekend.. Had a very good time with some crazy music of our choice.. Loved it..
2019,Pathetic service. Went their on a Wednesday afternoon. The staff are doing us a favour here and the young crowd are shouting vulgar languages to each other. Would definitely not recommend family to go. 
2020,"Pretty decent place with option for indoor (extremely loud, pub type) as well as outdoor (calm and serene) seating. The food was decently good. All in all a good option for anyone in punjabi bagh. "
2021,Thursday night.. it was almost empty.. still the service was lazy.. staff was less educated...food was average.. Manager was roaming like puppet... billing staff was busy in tempering bills to extract money out of tax amount.The only good thing was live music 
2022,"So today me and my friends visited this place for hookah and good food but no no no... Their hookah was pathetic and food quantity is also not satisfactory! To top it all, they even charged us with service charge of 10%, when we showed them the article of newspaper specifying that its not mandatory to pay service charge, they wanted a legal written notice by the government itself for the same. Haaanji!! Kejrival btayega aapko aake kaaan mein ki bhai mere, logon ko banana band kr! Keep up the good work. May god bless u with eyes to see, ears to listen 😊 ."
2023,"Good food! But the hookah was poor! Our hookah was replaced thrice but not even once, it was satisfactory. Also, one very important point 😊 the staff and the managers have direct dealing with the government so if anyone has any sought of questions related to political issues, kindly write it down to TOS! Unlike other restaurants they recieve special notification against demonetization and service charge!!! God! Their highly educated staff 👌"
2024,If you want to ruin your special day ...you must visit TOS.  The sofas were awful .. dirty and burnt. Thanks to mafia 2.0 as saviour. Would not recommend anyone to visit TOS. 
2025,Great ambiance but disgusting service and average food . If you want some drinks and dance that this place us awesome is not that should not make a mistake to visit there
2026,The worst place which I have been in my life...the terrace is shit... all the seats are burnt and I had to end my party and shift it to mafia
2027,I went there for a friends birthday party. This is surely on of the finest lounge in west Delhi. The staff was really nice and the food was delivered on time. We are planning to visit this place soon again.
2028,"I love this place because (1) it's totally chill, and (2) I like their cocktails.  It's a great place to hang out and catch up with friends.  It may be crowded, but it never gets too crazy.  The servers are courteous and recommend good dishes to you."
2029,Went there on Sunday afternoon ..it was crowded but not overly crowded . Had a rooftop sitting because there was high volume DJ on the 4 floor though rooftop had a speaker ..but is possible to talk on rooftop unlike the 4 floor. Comfortable seating . There is a hole in one of yr sofa so pllz change them for God's sake . When we tried placing order... Many items were not prepared though it was 4 in the evening or it wasn't possible for them to serve... ..a good lounge should be able to serve what's there in its menu . Food was good and mocktails too. Service was average .
2030,"At first I found this place very irritating. The music was tooo loud 😖 but later it was fine 👀.Situated in the middle of Punjabi Bagh club road, this place is pocket friendly. They offer snacks, drinks and hukkas. You can enjoy here only if you are with friends.The staff was fine and the crowd was average (actually below average 😂).Ps: ""berry beery"" drink was too bad in taste. I felt like I am drinking some cough syrup eww 😖."
2031,"An utter Disappointment! Firstly, you need to change your staff members and if not, teach them some etiquette! Let's start with your service, 'those waiters',as ill mannered as one can be, were in no mood to even serve us the menu card on time. Forget about the order!  The remarks from one of the waiters was highly disappointing when asked for a quick service.  The FOOD was not fresh, cold and I was bound to think how on earth can one serve you a COLD PIZZA.  Like it was kept in the refrigerator for ages.  Thought of trying my hands on some other options in the food column, I was given the menu card like after  15 minutes or so. Ah!  This isn't the last level of disappointment. There...read more"
2032,"Experience hasn't been what I'd say as pleasant. The worst of it all is the service. Given it was a Monday evening, staff was not attentive at all and was giving a deaf ear to all the calls. Well not all hope was lost, good things accounted for the Hookah. We ordered the Commissioner, was pretty decent. Food was is what I'd say was ""OK"". Arbiata/white pasta and pizza were good. I've been here twice, and burgers were unavailable both the times for some reason. Alcohol pricing I'd say was decent. ₹150-200 for 30ml Indian brands. ₹250-350 for 30ml International brands. Beer was pocketable as well. Ambience was even fairly good. I'd prefer terrace seating anyday but there's a...read more"
2033,"Hola guys! Been a while since I posted my last review. Today let's ponder upon my experience at Take Off Scarlet.4 people, 4 desires, 1 place.We were looking for a place decent enough to make the evening great for us and TOS did its work well. The ambience to my surprise was so catchy, the music was just perfect and the food was scrumptious.I won't say that it is a pocket friendly place, but yes, I can assure you that each penny you spend here is worth it.Absolutely loved the experience and I highly recommend this place.Cheers!"

2044,It's one of the best places to hang out with your friends and it serves the best for a true foodie. :DThe food is extremely delicious. The food exhibits the 'value for money' completely. 
2045,"Bad service ...The waiter was not at all bother in serving food Pathetic service , no value of moneyOverall bad............ Not worth your money... "
2046,"Food sucks, hookah not good,management ignores rest you know but one thing i like about this place is that one thing and that is nothing I'm just completing word limit."

2048,"Recently visited with  my friends. Their dj is good. Tried their spring rolls , pasta , lotus stem .Food was not up to the mark. Quantity was also less. Service was very slow.Only good for dance. Nothing special "

2050,Take off Scarlet...Is popular for ambience and large area...And different type of AMBIENCE at terrece...Good food... Excellent service...Got funtastic experience
2051,"RATING- ZERO (0)Went there few days ago with my group had some food and boozes over there and  food what we order was garden fresh pizza trust me the taste was pathetic, then we order platter nd some non veg that was average in taste. What problem we had with this management was they charged us with service charge, which we all know that it's not applicable for now but after arguing with the manager for some 15 mins they refused to wave off the service charge. They just loot people thats why they are still in running position,  nd yes there terrace was not hygiene there was birds shit all over there on furnitures nd seats were not clean enough in day light u cant even sit if you will...read more"
2052,"Worst service seen till date in any restaurant, bar, cafe,lounge...  .ordered food and it came after 50 mins on table. ....even the place not crowded ...there were about 10 tables out of which only 5--6 were occupied. ...poorest service...poor poor management. ..they don't knw how to tackle the customers. ...will surely nvr visit dis place again nd will nt recommend"
2053,"I wish I could give 0. This place should be shut down. There is nothing, nothing good about this place. From expensive tasteless cheap quality food to under-age drinking to highly delayed service, they master in everything. Don't even try to go to this place."
2054,One of the most famous places in punjabi bagh I Celebrated my birthday here and had an unforgettable experience. First of all the ambience itself was marvelous. Food was quite satisfying and the best part was the DJ and lighting. It's a must visit
2055,"Not at all worth trying! Service was pathetic and the moment we stepped in terrace, the seat covers were so filthy that when asked the waiter he said mam we know its dirty but cant help it! Still out of all the seats, we managed to find one spot which was less dirty and then when we called the waiter to order, more than half the things were not available and even a basic pizza was not available what more to expect! He named only a few dishes and said only these are available and we felt like we are sitting in a dhaba than a cafe!! For the service they provide its not even worth a single penny!! I hope the authorities soon take an action! It doesnt match the standards of punjabi bagh or...read more"
2056,"Not worth trying!! WORST service a place can ever provide. Most of the dishes in the menu were unavailable for no reason. Every order took so long. Even a glass of coke was served after 15-20 mins.No sense of serving people with water. No music senses. The dishes were not worth the prices charged. We ordered 4-5 chicken snacks ( chicken 65 , drums of heaven , chicken wings etc. ) which had the same taste and were extremely spicy .Infact the STAFF and MANAGER were least interested and on complaining the manager he is reacted as if the complaints he is getting from us are not new and he is not concerned about them.And yes its a place with no hygineNot at all recommanded!! THIS PLACE IS...read more"
2057,"No doubt the ambience is great.. the terrace is great. But the service is too slow,staff was not listening . Food was fine. music was too boring. Just the ambience is good. Pasta was nice. The cutlery was not cleaned.I guess am too late in reading views on zomato about this place or I would not have ever tried this place after reading horrible experience of people .Needs a lot of improvement n maintenance. Definitely not worth it."
2058,"So I was here attending an after party of my farewell and I'd say, the DJ told us he was playing his last song at 6:30 (that means he was closing down), there were some people staring at the girls in our party and talking to the bouncer and in the end (people usually hug and go home), so the bouncer or I don't know, this guy approached me and started talking about the same in haryanvi. I'd say that they tried their best to ruin the day for us.  "
2059,Pathetic place nd i would suggest people to never attend a new years party der.. The place costs like huge and in return these people dont even have sufficient cutlery to serve the guests.. waiters wer serving foods wid hands nd they make u eat food in wet quarter plates.. also they assure u dat no stag entry vl b taken.. however d place was filled wid cheap crowd..  my exp at d place was pathetic..
2060,"How this place can be sooooo patheticStarting from.. 1) Music : too loud that no one can talk 2) Service : pathetic, too slowI waited for half an hour just to get a menu.... After that i waited for another half an hour to order stuffs.... No one was bothered to take my order.... I was calling waiter to take my order even after that no one came3)Management : again ""vahiyat"" 4) now lets talk about FOOD😷I don't have words to describe how bad it was....i just ordered chilly paneer and pizza which was highly recommended by manager itself (rest he said there is nothing good in veg- that's what that manager said) After waiting for 45 minutes i got pizza which was not even...read more"
2061,Had great experience here!Ambience- 5/5Food-3/5Drinks-5/5Hooka-5/5The dj here was the best thing. He played all songs which we told and we had great time
2062,"Perfect place for partying, economical in range.Food was good but m very much disappointed with service staff,service was very poor,confused waiters and no use of booking  a table prior.Managers dun know where to let the guest sit..Standing for 10 mints in lounge Nd nobody is telling the seat..Finally v take seat on our ownMusic was okayish Nd DJ was also goodMust try veg platter"
2063,The Most horrible place and 3rd class serviceIf you order a black label they get you 100 piperFood terrible. They way of talking of manger is lyk you a giving food free to the customer 
2064,"So, this place offers a very eye-catchy,spacious and beautiful terrace cafe. It's a starry place. Last time I visited here, I witnessed the place holding a promotional event for wajah tum ho cast. The prices are charged according to the high standard ambience they attempt to provide. The second floor offers a good disc to dance and enjoy with your friends too. But when it comes to service and hukkah, they need to work alot on both. Food is fine."
2065,"Its a hopeless place to be in.They provide only half the menu printed on menu card.Tables were dirty.Staff was not at all courteous.We changed the restaurant because of non availability of food items.The place is not at all worth going.Terrace was horrible,with used glass displayed on bar table."
2066,Pathetic place..... poor service.... poor quality foodRude staff..... dirty plates....will never suggest anyone Worst of all on club road..
2067,The place was great...delicious food. But they need to improve there service😕 n the dj time period was a shrt...the have the finest terrace in d area...over ol experice was gud....must visit👍
2068,Good infrastructure but bad management and service. Duration of Dj was short but with an energetic and awesome aura .The management was short of cutlery and they wont serve you anything untill you ask them to The food was tasty and the terrace was also good but the photographer was busy talking to his friends.. all over the place is good but you would not like to visit it again and again. 
2069,I visited this place  but was disappointed due to the inavaliability of some food items  they have one of the finest terrace in the areaservice wasn't available there for food Worst experience.
2070,Very poor service  too rud staff manager are to rudd also pathitik food no class not recommended to visit to place music is good ambience is good 
2071,. Manager  didn't know how to handle the place. Worst service ever. It was like dining in a government restaurant. Nobody was bothered and worst part was the manager.                             
2072,"TAKE OUR SYMPATHY- TOS... This is my sympathy for those who will be visiting this place. Worst food I have ever tasted But I may say that their service is so fast that a dish takes just 1.5 hours to be served and that too cold food...I appreciate them for this😏 Hope they are not in a mood to make some record of serving food at this pace. I will also want to appreciate the rudeness, cuningness and their smartness in making a fool of the customer. I will give full marks to the smartness of their staff. Who the hell are they to laugh at their customers and blame the customer for the mistakes of their own staff and then asking compensation from the customer.😏😏Won't recommend this...read more"
2073,"Okay- fine furnishing, great location, best terrace but the worst service ever. My friend and I booked a birthday party for a small crew. The club first had to be corrected for typing the name of the host from 'kashish' to 'Tavish'. More importantly this was an expensive deal which we had, the club won't even bother to look through our seating. When we arrived, the table was pre-occupied with people. The staff had to be confirmed our identities with receipt to have an affirmative to our seats.Then we all started to enjoy the dance floor. The DJ, surprisingly was over expectations but was only for a short period of time. The food was good but......For the food to come to our table the...read more"
2074,"personally I hate my experience. The worst service ever! I had my booking for the birthday party, and there was no serving of food! the staff was very rude and so as the managers. At the time of bill they even did a calculation mistake (16x 1100- 17600, but as per TOS its 19400 )and tried to charge ₹1800 extra. Pathetic Experience!!   "
2075,"I presonally hated my experience in this cafe. The past and pizza were bad as hell, like the worst I have ever had. Moreover, the service was way too slow and not upto the mark as regard to the growing competition. Infact on the corner most seats you can even find rats, like is it really a cafe or some roadside bullshit dhaba which are way better in anyway."
2076,The worst lounge you will ever come across in punjabi baghIt is a big disappointment and very unhygienicThe service is very slow. It took them more than 30 minutes to serve our food The food is average All those who want to taste food with RATS should go thereWe were sitting there and when we stepped out of the table we spotted two rats roaming there The rats were huge and white in color We were shocked to see the rats roaming around near our tableFortunately we all were safe and when we complained  about it to the management  they disagreed then we showed them and proved them. They really need alot of improvement to match the level of other lounges THEY NEED TO IMPROVE THE...read more

2078,"First time visited and had a bad experience. Staff was not up to mark, service was low and music was like hell. Was not expected from this property. Last thing that Manager named Abhishek is so rude, if you guys have to do this then why are you keeping a manager like this who doesnt know how to respect. Wont ever come again here."
2079,Loved the place. Ambience is lively .The music is amazing. I tried chilli mushrooms and chilli garlic noodles. Chilli mushrooms were very well prepared. Its pretty economical. Just the stuff is a bit confused . 
2080,"Take off Scarlett actually One of the place for chilling and hanging around with friends👍🏻The music and the lighting are totally appropriate ..... giving great feel The food and the staff ,both are tasty and accurate respectively.. Ambience 4/5 Food..."

Firstly , the place is huge by Punjabi Bagh Club road standards. Its also a bit shady but to the extent that its comfortable.

You will enjoy a lot while you are on booze and hookah, but when it comes to food and service, this place is little disappointing. We had Blue Lagoon, Watermelon based mocktail and Virgin Mojito in drinks. For starters we had Chilli Paneer, tiny spring rolls, Veg Pizza, Chicken Tikka, Chicken 65, White Sauce Penne Pasta,, Mixed Sauce pasta and each and every dish was below average.

Congratulations on your new venture !!Would like to share my experience at your Pub ( WORST ).The food quality & decor was up to the satisfaction but the staff  attitude & behaviour from the floor manager to the waiter was pathetic. On 2nd Oct.i was there for lunch with my family from ASHOK VIHAR. The order placed was incomplete the Hukka which was ordered at the time of mocktail  & snacks was served after lunch.

2097,The worst place ever the ambience is dirt smelling puke the worst arrangements and managements . Not good food quality = had fish full of salt and nothing else. Worst dj person who did not even mentioned requests of a birthday wish . Seriously the worst and not worth lounge 😤
2098,"Ambience is nice , DJ is good, but your services are not ""worth it"". It took exactly 57 minutes to serve the sheesha , and the staff was not co-operative. We were telling them to put tissues ,serve us water. Please look towards the staff attitude basically on the terrace area. Though food was nice!"
2099,Worst experienceNever ever go to this place. They try to rob you by any means. They are least co-operative and money minded. Only if you are interested to be robbed. Go to such a a club otherwise there are many clubs far better than this
2100,The interiors are good but its on the 4th floor and there is no lift so one has to take the stairs. Not a place for people who wanna booze as this place doesn't has much to offer. I was surprised to see that they only had miller and kingfisher and the biggest let down was that miller was out of stock and all I could get was kingfisher. The food was above average.There was no crowd as it was thursday and one can't expect much from a punjabi bagh cafe on weekdays so it's ignorable. The usp of this place is its rooftop which is not of much use in summers but I'm looking forward to visit this place again in winters only for the rooftop cafe. 
2101,Most pathetic experience ever. It was a nightmare type of experience we had. The problems are as follows:1/ Booked a party for 60 people only and they were not able to handle such a small party. 2/ Untrained staff. They had no idea what to do. 3/ The food quality was appropriate but they were serving cold food.4/ The manager was scolding the staff in front of everyone but the staff was still hassled serving 60 people 5/ We ended up having a fight there because of there never ending arguments on everything we demand6/ They were trying to end the party by 12:45 and was pushing us to eat and leave7/ They were serving us alcohol on our tables and when we are out of sight they were...read more

What i ordered1.Early morning drink - Awesome, recommended. It had cinnamon and citrus fruits, it was yumm.2.The pinch - it was watermelon drink with huge amounts of ice. Pretty much like watermelon crushed and sugar and ice is added, not upto the mark.3.Veg garden pizza- it was nice, thin crust.4.Cheese sticks - they were very tasty and something unique, loved it.5.chilly potato - It was satisfying much , happy with the way they made it.6.Mix sauce pasta - it was quite tasty.7.Paneer tikka- it was in green marination which I didn't like, i...read more"

Chicken soup had large chunks of juicy chicken. Both the soups were delicious. Then we ordered murgh malai tikka, chilly potato and paneer pizza. Malai tikka was flavourful and soft. Chilly potatoes were aptly crispy and flavours were perfect to my taste. Now coming to paneer pizza, we ordered thin crust. This dish was the best of all and is recommended.

They were pushing the servers in front, in order to hide themselves.. The food & other stuff is worthless..

2106,TOS is a pretty happening place to get rid of your work blues. The roof top sitting is pleasant in the evening and the food is good too. My mojito took all my gloom away. It is so rejuvinating and hummus and pita is good too. I also tried their sheesha which was not so smooth but overall i had a good experience
2107,"The worst day i can ever had is with the TOS, totally spoiled my day with no music, no good food and hookah without a smoke. The mark of good lounge is not just its ambience but the quality of food and the professionalism of its staff. The manager their is so arrogant.What a disappointment, Visiting TOS was certainly an experience to remember but one that i have never hope to repeat and would not wish upon anyone else and I was planning my birthday party over there. Thank God I experienced this type of service now which at least saved my most precious day for not to get spoiled.If the rating could be negative, I would prefer to give negative rating.Worst Experience."

It was my birthday party on 12th sept 2016.I was expecting much from this place but The service was PATHETIC.Food wasn't an issue at all but the manager and the service staff were not cooperative. I had to tell them to serve snacks, liquor to the guests every time. And the main turn off was that THERE WAS NO PROFESSIONAL  DJ on that night.

2110,Worst experience ever. Bad service . Whatever we ordered from menu dey didnt had.We ordered hookah dey didnt had redbull and said we cannot arrange. No water was served till 15 20 min.
2111,"Newly opened lounge in Punjabi Bagh, i believe it has probably the best terrace in the area. Its huge and spacious. Though the food is good, but be prepared to wait for a long time for it to be served. The servers were really confused. I had to ask tons of times for forks and serving spoons. There were none on the table. Coming to the food, Chilly chicken, white sauce pasta and Amritsari fish were really nice and they didnt have few dishes from the menu available such as prawns. So overall, its a good place to chill and the dj is playing all day long- something which you dont get in every lounge! "
2112,"PATHETIC 😏😏 BAD HOSPITALITY , NO MANNERS TO TALK TO GUESTS NO PROPER INFORMATION 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻DONT EVER GO ...... We booked place and nobody was there to attend  and the manager is totally snob ...... Not on to words ..... "
2113,"Worst cafe ever..It was a special day for me. They screwed it all.. Food- food was yukk.. pizza was hell boring, cheese cigars was like rubber.Cocktails- half of them were unavailable.. and the one we ordered was not that good.Staff- the staff was least bothered about their customers.. no-one was their attend us evytime.. i mean it was like , we need call them twice or thrice for one thing.. worst staff ever seen in any cafe.. Roof- ons good thing was that we booked a table on terrace..but still it was also not that good.. I will never recommend anyone to even try this cafe, atleast not on special occasions because for sure they r gonna screw it.  rest upto you guys.. "

There is an issue when you sit you realise there are mosquitos which are also dining with you.. this was a big turn off because i felt that i was in a dhabba or something....Anyways i still decided to give it a shot and lets try food...

And the dj which the restaurant claimed was apparently celebrity dj (I don't who were they nobody knows them celebrity dj) they had such idiotic sense of humor , drunk , shouting on such pathetic songs ! At one point in time the situation was let's leave this place get out from this torture from stupid dj. Everyone was actually got up and left because of extremely loud music. The manager was rude that lady was abusing and owner hardly paying attention. Bad place bad crowd. "

I visited this place at 4 p.m and most of the places were either occupied by their owners and the others were reserved , still we managed to get a table  , we ordered food and guess what happened? They told us to shift ,without even confirming do they have table for us , and then what we had no option but to leave the cafe.THe humiliating part was that they were not even courteous enough to apologize. What i thot was , their sole aim is to earn money out of profits without even caring about the other guest.Would not recommend this cafe at allGiven one 1 star, but their hospitality deserves a black star!"
2120,Super Good Ambiance great food good quality and quality of food was good too best thing was sheesha lighting sheesha we had it 1-2 hours non stop still smoke was not bit decreased. 
2121,"An elegant and classy lounge and restaurant. With soothing music and slow service.Hookha was not upto the mark as throat hits were way too strong. Food was normal,nothing special about the presentation of the food."
2122,Came here several times just because of good food and decent music. Service is a bit slow.Hookah was like hell. Always had a great time here.
2123,"A much hyped place and now i know why. Great ambience and seating. Variety of seats, and can be customized as well. Servers are helpful and friendly. Coming to food, paneer tikka pizza was really tasty. Lots of paneer chunks and fresh too. Coming to dry Manchurian balls, they were crisp on the outside and soft cooked on the inside. Really tasty and good in quantity. The pinch mocktail with cole kala khatta flavour was really nice. The watermelon mock tail was also fresh and different from usual mock tails. Alcohol and hukka is served here. Come one come all.."
2124,Visited this awesome place with friends for a birthday celebration. Classy ambience!Food was also good but many things from the menu was unavailable and service was also slow. would have given 4.5 ratings.
2125,"Decent place in North Delhi, however it definitely does not cost you 1000 for two people as zomato suggests. It costs you around 2k for a couple. "
2126,Visited this Lounge several times and had a great time here.Two things i must say about this Lounge. First- Tasty Food and Good Service Second- Music is good to hear and to dance.
2127,Visited this Property on 11th August and enjoyed a lot with my office friends. Food and service was too good. Music was decent according to the crowd. I forgot to take the Dj's number for my Private Functions. Please share the Contact Details of the DJ.Great Job done by the Directors of Take Off Scarlet
2128,I came on 11th August 2k16 and i had a great time with my Girl and all Friends i came with. Food and Service was good. Dj was behind my imagination. I could say i have heard the best music in Punjabi Bagh. Hatts Off to the Dj who managed the Crowd.

2130,"Friendship Day as it was! FULLY JAM PACKED with amazing crowd. Initially we were told that there will be a waiting for an hour or so but we did not lose our hopes and went inside because WE COULD NOT RESIST THE CLUBBISH FEEL IT WAS HAVING.We did get our table in like 10 minutes so,STAFF AND SERVICE- Nice. They come to your table again and again to clean it and serve you the food.FOOD - I had smoked honey chicken, Penne White Pasta, Chilly Chicken, Dahi Kebab.. EVERYTHING was yumm! Pasta could be better though.DJ AND MUSIC - loud and happening! DRINKS AND SHEESHA - probably the best serving in west delhi i would say.Yes it is a little on the costlier side, but WORTH EVERY PENNY. "

The Vegetables used were fresh and had perfect crunchiness.The most unique dish is their Bombay Vada Pav with perfectly cooked and soft Vada made of Aloo and the tangy sauce, which makes this Vada Pav taste amazing.The Vegetarian Starters include the Cheese Cigar Rolls that are stuffed with loads of cheese and served...read more"

2135,"Take Off Scarlet or TOS as it is commonly known around, has got all the tools to be a feather in the cap of Punjabi Bagh and seems to be a rising favourite already, judging by the fact that it was houseful on Tuesday noon. But it has a number of flaws at the moment amd if they can cover them up, i can see them as a big player in this market in future.LOCATION: it is located on Club Road, North West Avenue. (plz do not use their location that is pinned on zomato..it leads to a nearby residential colony).AMBIENCE/INTERIORS: Its dimly lit, voguish interior has a very cheerful vibe..add to it their loud music system..this place has got the perfect setting for parties.

Many come and many go but this lounge come up with utmost good features, and less flaws.Fellas looking for perfect party house with quality food and craziness in dance floor then, this is a highly recommended place. With dim lights beneath the table and status of Caesar all over, it maintains an uniqueness. Seating has its own privacy, birthday parties have their own corners and DJ has all the hit charts to bluster the ambience.Moving on to drinks,-Ordered The Pinch, Nice refreshing drink. *HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*-Ordered Tutti Fruity, Not good at all and tastes like cough syrup.-Ordered Electric...read more"

We danced to some good beats for around 30 minutes or so.Food and drinks:Bombay Vada Pao: Soft buttery buns with the right amount of spices and delicious vada made this perfect.Dahi Ke Kabab: They were a bit salty and sour.

2143,"Very loud place with super dim lighting. The crowd at day time (when we were visiting) was at its punjabi bagh's worst. But if the management takes care of the kind of crowd they let inside the premises, the place can be a hit because of its superiorly done decor and classy interiors. The bar is huge but very poorly managed. Starting with the drinks, the electric blue and the morning explosion were both too sweet and needed some punch to it. I ordered for a virgin watermelon mojito and i was expecting it to be pretty good, but sadly it wasnt! Nonetheless the food is good here! The cheese cigar rolls taste yum and super gooey but only if had warm. Malai chicken tikka was a teeny tiny bit...read more"
2144,I think TOS is one of the best lounges Punjabi Bagh has ever had. It's full of energy and always crowded. The crowd is amazing. One would definitely come after visiting it once! The hookah is amazing and has a lot of variety in it. Food is 10/10! 
2145,Located just opposite starbucks . Take off scarlet sets a benchmark to becoming the new most visited cafes in west delhi . A must visit place for hookah lovers and the ones who lives music . A great combination of good punjabi beats and amazing hookah flavours . Would highly recommend dubai comissioner and choudhary hookah .

2147,"Take off scarlet is yet another amazing lounge to chill in at Punjabi bagh club road with a good dj and amazing food. What's best is the sheeshas it offers. Unique sheeshas which are made with precision and the sheesha service is amazing, the people serving the sheesha were polite and cooperative whenever we needed a coal change or anything else. I haven't had a better hookah anywhere else in Delhi !"

For food, we tried the cheese cigar rolls, the Bombay vada Pav, Daahi ke kebab. All of which were really good. Special mention to a unique combination of fries and keema that I saw just here, it's highly recommended.

The ambience is pretty nice with that dull lightning perfect to set the mood and ample space to sit and relax with your friends When it comes to food, especially the starters, they are pretty delectable. With a punch of desi touch in it, they are appropriately baked and cooked. Talking about mocktails, they have a good collection and were pretty refreshing.

Served with french fries, it was like cherry on the Top and it was the best experience along with a cold pint of beer they have, BIRA white.Other friend of mine ordered gourmet veggie burger.

I went there today it took them 70 mins to prepare fish and chips and an extra 45 mins to prepare the next dish, provided the lounge was just half occupied... so an above average quality of food served at a pathetically slow pace that would even make your hunger die by the time it comes... so a place i wouldn't recommend anyone to go unless that the only place left on earth to have food and you are ready to wait for an hour after ordering your food..."
