,L'Opéra
0,I like there cakes the coffer texture the way its chocolatey but they are little over priced. But otherwise the taste of the cakes are super yum and delicious. Their macrons are super yumm as well
1,"L'Opéra brings french taste and designs to you. What I have experienced so far is- there is no comparison to them, be it in quality, taste or the perfection in looks of pastries.The options they have will surely make you rethink your decision all again.I have ordered nutty chocolate delight and I must say it is a package of fulfillment to nut and chocolate lovers."
2,"I just had a stale black forest pastry here. I pointed out to the manager Vinod in the beginning, but he was extremely imposing and said that it was fresh.I am never going back to a place that keeps stale items and cannot do inventory management.This place has lost its charm, the original in Khan market was really good when it opened."
3,"Tried this chocolate Mille-feuille and it was very average. The puff sheets were rather hard and not crisp, expected better quality at such a high price. "
4,Must had a coffee and opera pastry 
5,Probably they do the most instagrammable desserts in town ! A cute little french-style bakery store at Select City walk mall with so many options to order from.. have tasted Chocolate trio and rose macarons on my first visit which were really nice and then tasted the sacher torte recently.. quite sweet for my taste but had that nutty buttery yumminess entirely and was quite fresh !
6,This is my favourite dessert spot in Select City Walk. I make sure to have their dessert everytime I visit the mall. Their Opera cake is a must try.
7,"Good place to hang out for a coffee. Pastery is obviously their speciality. I would recommend this place for their great pastery, cakes and coffee. "
8,"Go here for the mille feuille dessert, which is amazing. Otherwise, not worth the cost for microwaved food. Had the chicken quiche too, which was alright, wouldn't recommend."
9,Had chocolate macaroons from here.... Mind blowing. Will definitely try their pastries next time. Prices are on a higher side but I found the macaroons totally worth.
10,Tried this white orchid duet tea with milk and almond tart. Tea was a perfect fusion of taste and smell while the Tart was also good but a way too sweet for me. It was undoubtedly presentable. Had that amazing aroma. Place looks simply beautiful. Croissants looked delicious but wasn't able to try it though. Will try sooner.
11,"I placed an order on 10th of April, three breads, for which I paid directly by card. Got a call from L’Opera saying only 2 were available. The lady asked if I wanted a replacement, but I asked for a refund of the missing bread. She told me she would take the latter to Zomato. Someone from Zomato called me to confirm with me that I wanted a refund. And I am still waiting for it. Today I take the issue to Zomato customer support and they tell me it’s too late to ask for anything. It is unacceptable that the customer has to bear the cost of this."
12,"Was here last Sunday night for evening snacks tried coffee with cookies, coffee was okayish similar too other cafe brands but cooking was deliciousneed more to give another star with awareness"
13,Found the tart and pastries to be average at best. Expected it to be much much better than this. Coffee was okayish nothing special. Overl average experience.
14,Great choice to buy cakes! And yes they taste exquisite!  It keeps up to its French name :) the chocolate was all kinds that you can imagine. Even a layer of white chocolate. 
15,"L’opera’s products are always very good and fresh That’s why we are a regular client.Yesterday I got a Christmas cake , the same kind I got last week as well and it was the best one I had ever had, but the one I got yesterday when I opened at home and tried for my surprise was very dry! I guess at least 2-3 days old. My disappointment is with the selling a not fresh product in this particular salon of l’opera :("
16,I sent a cake to a friend with specific instructions to address it to my friend’s name and not mine. Also to write Happy Birthday on it. None of the request was fulfilled. The royal chocolate cake was nevertheless scrumptious.
17,"Took my money, failed to deliver my order. Apparently my number wasn't reachable, which is rubbish. My address was definitely reachable though so I don't understand the issue. Won't refund me. Shady shady operator, especially so when considering the premium you pay to these clowns."
18,"Was here last Sunday night for evening snacks tried coffee with cookies, coffee was okayish similar too other cafe brands but cooking was delicious "
19,Every single time I order they decline my order stating that they don't have sufficient quantities. So last time when they did this I called the restaurant directly and asked whether they had 4 pieces of lemon tarts (which was my order by the way) and that said yes they did. I don't understand why my order is not fulfilled the first time around and I have to waste half an hour of my life every time I order through zomato. Whose fault is it?
20,The macroons were dry and flaky and very stale.So disappointing . Such a fan of opera but of late it’s been not upto the mark. At such a price the quality is degenerating
21,"#Hyped #Overpriced #Doesn'tOfferValueForMoneyOrdered online, chocolate trio mousse and brownie .Both seemed average.Nothing exceptional as what the price demands it to be .#overpriced #notworthit."
22,Best birthday cake I ever had. Thanks to Rahul Taank brother. Super good in taste and I have tried other desserts here as well. Would definitely recommend to try this. 
23,The dessert selection here is good and this coming from someone who doesn't have a sweet tooth! Love the tiramisu here. No secret that L'Opera is on the higher side of the price range. I don't mind it the once in a while when I feel like having something sweet!
24,Best macaroons all over Delhi .... soft n melt in mouth macaroons .... love the chocolate and coffee macaroons ....Soft moist pastries and cakes a complete French bakeryLove the chocolate mille feuille
25,Very sad blue berry cheese cake. One of the worst i must hv ever had. Its very sugary n and ill formed cream with some forced blueberry essence.Complete no- no.Ya but the must hv thing is a coffee eclair. Unfortunately most of the times it over. They shud keep more of those eclairs. Humble request
26,I was craving for something sweet so went there for some sweet delicacies.I always quote .....There can be no best place to have an awesome dessert.Parking - Paid mall parking.Food - This outlet is in the corridor of a mall. This is not a perfect place to catch up with friends and do a chit chat as the eatery is located in a very noisy. Place ..The taste of each dish is superb.Service - 4/5Ambience - Small space with limited seating.Price- High.
27,I had ordered my sandwich one and a half hour back... still waiting for it to be delivered...!! :-((... highly unproffesional  service. The customers can’t wait that long for a simple sandwich to be delivered...!! Very annoyed
28,"Expensive, very expensive but worth the cost. Ordered this amazing nutty filled pastry , it was filthy chocolaty rich. It had all the ingredients to mellow down the chocolate craving with its layers. "
29,I have always loved their Cappuccino.. Good bakery products as well. Nice place to spend the time with your partner or even with yourself for a cup of coffee.
30,exceptionally delicious. .excellent taste of desserts. definitely ordering again
31,Little pricy but everything was amazing!
32,"Ordered baguette ham sandwich, loved it. The bread was excellent, if for you the bread is the most important part of the sandwich you will love it too."
33,The ham had an extremely weird taste this time. Never has this happened before. I hope the restaurant will look into this. 
34,"Very much on the expensive side but I did often order from here because of specific things I like -- Lennon Tea cake, mille feuilles and cinnamon rolls"
35,Sunday is always a great occasion to pamper myself with a meal out. Of course healthy options are not many hence discovering a salad section at opera made me happy! I tried garden salad this time: no fattening ingredients but fresh vegetables and a dressing u can add yourself made of vinegar and olive oil. Great option to avoid cheese and carbohydrates 🙃 they serve it with a small freshly baked multigrain loaf. The only negative note of this place is the lack of seats (only few are available and not enough space to eat in peace).
36,The place to get the best desserts.. one of the finest bakery..!! Everything was delicious but it was expensive too..!! I had ordered the Chocolate royal individual pastry and believe me it was super soft and delicious..!! The place is small but the food was amazing..!! 
37,My favourite place to go when i want to have macaroons.But its been 1-2 times when  the macaroons were hard.Lemon tart -tastes veryyy goood . 9.5/10Blueberry cheese cake - 9/10 very flavourfull and people who love cheesecakes must try this one.Chocolate mousse - my personal fav. 10/10
38,I ordered Opera cake for my birthday.... And the cake was extremely fresh soft and amazing in taste... Opera cake has this coffee dark chocolate flavor that is not too sweet nor bitter.... Perfect for my taste. 
39,This place never disappoints me. I am a huge fan of their cakes and pastries. The only complain that I do have is their eggless menu in cakes is very limited. 
40,"Good place for a quick short meeting or a coffee date. Went to this place last week on our way out from shopping in SCW. Initially, we went to Star bucks but as there were long queue, we moved straight to L O'Pera. Though it's tiny, at least 20 people could be accomodated in one go. The have a quite decent confectionary French bakery with freshly made pastries and cake. We just had one of their pastries and coffee. But the coffee didn't taste as were expected which is full of watery cum froth, we can't hardly taste it's coffee flavour ,if otherwise, this place ,I would say for freshly bakes cake or pastries. Be prepared not to get surprised as it would be a direct hit to your pocket.My...read more"
41,"The service was amazing, people were really courteous, the ambiance seemed fine but im rating it 4 because i have tasted better tarts and macroons. I was expecting something really phenominal."
42,A big fan of the confectionary. They have some amazing cakes with a french connection. Recently ordered a chocolate mille feuille and it was amazing. They do deliver at home. 
43,Ordered caramel macaroons and mille feuille.. my favourites.. heaven on earth.. also tried cold chocolate.. average.. Musts: mille feuille and caramel macaroonsQuality/food/taste: excellentQuantity: goodInterior: u can sit inside or outsideLocation: very goodService: goodStaff: goodCost: worth it
44,"Never fails to impress. With an impressive array of both sweet and savoury selections, the outlet offers delightful snacks, best enjoyed with their Tea and Coffee. "
45,"@From macaroons to tart  they have it all. They're all new cold chocolate comes in exciting hazelnut and orange flavour. I personally love the hazelnut one,it is a perfect blend with soft chunks chocolate. The lemon tart cannot be forgotten, it's a perfect balance of acidity and sweet!"
46,I haven't had better deserts in Delhi anywhere else. Very expensive but it's completely worth it. Highly recommend it if celebrating a special occasion and otherwise also. Do try the cold coffees too. 
47,"This is a tiny place and if there is a crowd of more than 10 this place gets crammed. I decided to pay this place a visit and get my morning coffee from there. I got a latte, cheese croissant and an apple tart. These guys know what they're doing.I loved the cheese croissant is my very balanced and the cheese did not overpower it. The apple tart was delicious, the crust was great and loved the apples. The latte was regular like any other place. The servers were polite and helpful. A nice experience, do go and check this place out."
48,"I used to visit L'opera ever since the first one opened at Khan. While the Croissant and the Raisin Brioche were my favourite, what I didn't like was how they hiked their prices- from pocket friendly to crazy unreasonable. Clearly french must mean expensive! Thank god I don't have a looney colonial hangover. I don't miss the place much."
49,Excellent bakery items especially the almond crossaint always stands out for me. Pricing is steep but then the quality is top notch as well. 
50,The place is quite expensive for some simple pastries and sandwiches. The shop is small as well with just few chairs around with not much to say about the ambience. 💁🏽 Lots of 💰 for simple tea ☕️ and coffee. 
51,"Dear management,To be short and sweet, presentation is marvellous however, I have had the worst blueberry cheesecake ever. Kindly change the recipe.Date 24th April 2017Bill no sc215000023937"
52,"Located on the ground floor of select city walk mall opposite Starbucks serves the most delicious desserts and bakery products in town. The whole range of cakes , pastries, macron and breads are out of the world.  The sitting however is very small and could have been slightly bigger. The chain has branches at other parts of the town too.  But this is certainly one of the finest bakery in town, though the prices are on the higher end"
53,"Had a chocolate croissant and latte - found both to be average. Had heard a lot about this place and found the ambience to be good, service was ok."
54,"So .. One of the finest bakery in delhi.. However you can pool in to make it more affordable  .. But who minds when you have an ever lingering after taste in your mouth..the pastries and cakes just melt in your mouth. The taste is too intense that all your senses can feel it.The quality is for sure a lookout for here. But after eating their signature pastry from here, you surely wouldn't  want try anywhere else.. I wish i earned crores to make L'Opera my habit. :-)"
55,This is the best bakery shop in our locality. I love their breads and yes macroons are my all time favourite. They have wide variety of macroons and cakes too. The quality of products is amazing though the prices are on the higher side. 
56,"The best cheese croissant I've ever had in Delhi , out of all L'Opera (pronounced Low-pe-haa) has the best. It tastes heavenly with cappuccino which also tastes good. The staff is very helpful and nice. Mushroom quiche is also really good but can't get over the cheese croissant must Try. "
57,"Make no mistake - you go to L'opera for an almost criminal indulgence (body and wallet). But when you do, you will not be disappointed - the eclairs when on the go, choco dome for that romantic dinner, and go big with cakes for a party - I have had the blueberry cheese cake and chocolate mousse cake and will recommend them strongly. It is rather difficult to not make yum noises while you devour your dessert that are borderline questionable!"
58,"Its a small cozy outlet in Saket and once you get in you would probably feel like tasting everything that's on display. I went there just to serve my craving for eating something sweet after a meal and tried the opera. It was yum, very light and just melt in mouth. Would like to try more of their offerings."
59,"I have a never ending love affair with this bakery.I absolutely love their macaroons. Although a bit pricey yet it serves you the best, so I never mind spending money over them since it's all worth it.  I recently tasted their cookies in this cute little outlet of their in select city and trust me these are the best you'd ever have till date : Chocochip walnut and Chocolate Diamant were so delicious and they melted on the tongue instantly. 😍"
60,"L'Opera is located on the ground floor, select citywalk mall, saket.In this cute little bakery, the first thing I ever tried here was the ALMOND CROISSANT & the experience was so killer, I was a fan for life. A warm flaky croissant which when bitten into has an almond paste that bursts into my mouth.The lemon tart (topped with meringue) is one of the best lemon tart which I have ever eaten. I like some pastries in L'Opera bakery that's brownie, truffon & royal chocolate. The prices are on the higher side but the quality of desserts served here make it worth spending extra.I will definitely recommend to our foodie friends 👍"
61,"A Getaway option for desert. Offers great variety of deserts thought of trying something different so tried Sacher Torte , didn't know initially what it was. It looked good hence ordred.It tasted good though it was quite heavy on my pocket."
62,The best bakery I have come across in Delhi. Slightly heavy on the pocket but It's delish. The breads are worth trying. I am not a fan of macarons but they are really good. Sugar free pastries are a no no but if you're still brave hearted go ahead and try. 
63,"Love the interiors and the display of the products!! The menu is nicely curated with Nice options available in breads, croissants.The interiors are very nicely done , the staff being polite and courteous.The price points are high but the quality justifies it perfectly!!"
64,"I have a sweet tooth and this place has high quality and delicious desserts.The Opera pastry itself,the little madelines they serve with coffee,they took desserts to a whole new level.Their quiche and sandwich selection may be limited but very tasty.The almond croissant melts in your mouth and I can go on and on.A must visit.You will always go back."
65,"Favourite patisserie after Oberoi patisserie. The only glitch is they run out of their stuff real fast and most things like chocolate eclair etc are almost always sold out. I also feel they should have a free home delivery option. But full on value for money, it's a great place to grab a quick snack when hungry or have it in your fridge for those midnight hunger pangs."
66,"Went for a macaroon, stayed for the espresso, chocolate chip - walnut biscuit and macaroon. The ambience is lovely: I almost forgot the Eiffel Tower wasn't a cab away. "
67,"This place is as good as a heaven. Loved their deserts, tried the Raspberry mousse and the Macarons. What flavours mann, i kid you not something I have been dying to eat from so long. Really enjoyed the Macarons and Mousse. This is specially to all the sweet lovers, do not miss out on this place. Their service, food or to simply say everything is amazing. Prices are a bit high but you'll forget about it once you taste their dishes😎Ambiance - 4.5/5Food - 4.5/5Price -4/5Staff - 4.5/5Cleanliness - 5/5"
68,"Possibly one of the top patisseries in the city but also one of the most expensive. So if you believe that quality comes at a cost then this is the place for you. The breads have always been a favourite. The cakes and pastries are divine but some of them cost nearly 400 bucks including taxes for a small portion so thats really a stretch. For that money, I could be eating a proper dessert in a proper cafe or restaurant."
69,"This place has really amazing desserts.The price is a bit on the higher side but I think it's every bit worth of it.I've had the Cheese croissant, royal chocolate and this other cake( I've forgotten the name)The desserts just melt in your mouth and the experience is incredible.I'd really recommend visiting once."
70,One of the best cakery's in town I've been to. Their cakes and pastries are absolutely melt in mouth. I loved their mili fili pastry as well as their original opera cake.A highly recommended!
71,"I'm giving this outlet a lower rating than the khan market and the nehru place outlet due to its coffee. I found the latte at the khan market outlet to be better than what they served me when I visited them. Must have been a rare off day for Lópera!But overall, the quality of the food and the deserts are on par with the other outlets!"
72,Each one of their cakes is a special one. The macarons are authentic and they've got pretty nice tea as well. Have tried their Saket and Vasant Kunj outlets but I guess they get it delivered from some place else.
73,A french bakery with varieties of desert!! If you are bored of eating the same pastries then you should visit and try new deserts here!! The pudding and pastries looks very fascinating! Macarons  are my all time favourite as it is so delicious and the coffee taste heavenly!!  
74,Wow! I love the L'Opera macarons so much! I tried almost all the flavours and trust me I couldn't pick a favourite because all of them tasted so good. They were sweet and gives a refreshing delight to the mouth! Absolutely love them :') 
75,Great to grab a coffee and some fabulous bakery while you wait for a movie in select city walk or mgf mall. Brownie and coffee would be my favourite.
76,😑😞😟😒😵😲👹👺😤😖😫😩😮😦😓😯😥😢😠😡😶👎These were my reactions when i tasted the first desert!!i ordered chocolate pastry costing rs.315!!  and it was soo bad that i felt like to vomit it out!!Soo overpriced Soo stale pastry!!soo badd restaurant!!
77,"Stale dessert.When we complained, we didn't even get a sorry in return.We ordered a chocolate pastry. It was completely stale and tasted bad. The sugar had gotten very sticky. After 2 bites each, we felt a vomity feeling in the stomach.When we complained, they said that all the desserts over here are same (like equally stale, eh?).The place is a so-called luxury bakery situated on the ground floor of Select City Walk, Saket. It is a small bakery with not much sitting space.Though the view outside from the window is beautiful. Interiors are nicely made. I would have not paid Rs 10 if I knew that it would be so bad. It costed me Rs 315. Gosh! I could have gone for so many chocolates...read more"
78,"Very classy looking dessert place with very limited seating space. Each item available looked very interesting. Had heard about their Macrons so decided to go with it. We chose Lemon, coffee and strawberry flavors and all were very disappointing. They looked great but they were very sweet for my taste. Didn't try anything further.All the stars are for the way the place has been made."
79,"Certainly not a Parisian knock off as others in the vicinity but just about average approximation of a french patisserie !This place doesn't have much seating and you're charged a premium for quick bite!Our sweet stake out begins with croissant , soggy with too generous swathes of butter .The famed macaroons, while very sugary aren't really that great ! We tried 2 . rose ones , which had reminiscent of lux soap almost ( too much essence ) and pistachio ones ( too less flavour ) . I'd mark out , Oberoi 360 does better job with fussy macaroons .Almond tart , passionfruit raspberry verrine & l'opera pastries can make you move ! loved them . The presentation of the desserts were...read more"
80,What I like about L'Opera is the distinctive character of the desserts. None are cloyingly sweet or creamy. The L'Opera signature pastry comes with delightful layers of almond crust and chocolate. The coffee caramel eclairs is sinful. Even the bread and butter pudding tastes good. I was surprised with a strawberry mousse from here and it was the best I have had. I do find the place a bit on the pricier side though.  The attendants are courteous and the service excellent. Which makes me go back there often
81,It was an ugly scar on the face of salon de l'opera. I had mille feuilles. It stood rock hard on its ingredients-when it came to its aroma but i was disturbingly disappointed when my taste buds started assessing it. The consistency and flavour fusion on which salon de has banked upon for so many...
82,"Lopera ,a famous name in delhi,known for their delicious pastries.so after all recommendation i tried their pastries,found delicious but yes its little overpriced.you will get so many other options in this locality in better price!!"
83,"I think of desserts, I'm dreaming of heaven & L'Opera is my own personal heaven. The Croissants, pastries, preserves... the list's endless- are all absolutely divine. Experience at L'Opera isn't just for your taste buds; it's sensory overload- the fragrance as soon as you walk in the door, the cozy atmosphere of a bakery, the happy smiles of everyone there & ofcourse, the pure euphoria of taste when you take that first bite.. it's beyond this world. It might pinch your pocket a little, but satisfies the palate like none other! "
84,"Eating a L'Opera pastry is like eating happiness. Not exaggerating. The desserts here remind you of Masterchef Australia desserts and you'll soon be talking like Gary saying ""The mouse is perfectly balanced with a bit of crunch and that added texture takes the experience to another level!"" All of this is true. Must have: Chocolate hazelnut slice, almond and coffee slice and the chocolate mousse. EXQUISITE! The desserts are well worth their price range and more. You won't regret splurging here! "
85,"This place nice collection for foodies,The bread and pastry quality are good, some wer French touch is there but not really.The best part is location.Good job done team"
86,The pastries are yum. The afamed macaroons aren't that great really but they look so tempting ! has raised the bar in Delhi for others its worth the cost
87,"L’Opera is a popular cafe located at the ground floor in Select Citywalk. It offers authentic and delicious French pastry and bakery products. They offer pastries, macrons, freshly baked breads, cakes, baguettes or tarts etc. L’Opera is one of Delhi’s reputed French Patisseries. Starting with their flagship store in Khan Market, they have opened a lot of outlets in Delhi and Gurgaon The place is small and doesn’t have too much space to dine in. The sitting arrangement with two small ledge-chaired high tables is a little congested. The macrons are a little on sweeter side. The opera cake is delectable and is a must try The breads and baguettes, pastries and croissants...read more"
88,"Top - notch place to visit. L'Opera is all posh, all vintage in its entire ambiance. Loved the way the cookies, bread,  macaroons were beautifully and seamlessly presented on the counter. I ordered the chocolate tart and the macaroons. Amazing!!! It's a must try for those having a sweet tooth. The macaroons were crunchy on the outside and gooey inside. Perfect! I had the chocolate and salted caramel macaroons.L'Opera immaculately justifies its name and is worth every penny you spend !!"
89,"This is a go-to place for pastry items. I had a dark chocolate Ganache pastry whose name is unfortunately escaping me, and a vegetable quiche. Both were quite satisfying. Their seating is limited but the shop isn't very crowded either, so that works out. And yes it's fairly expensive, but so far it has proven to be worth it."
90,For the first time i thought of trying some fancy sweets and chose L'Opera. It was a take away and i ordered 6 different flavoured macaroons and it was just so expensive 😏 phew. I was excited to taste it and it was a huge disappointment for me. They tasted nothing more than a normal biscuits infact not even that good. I was so sad to waste my almost 1000bucks on this fancy sweets. I have no clue abt other things. My this review is totally based on the macaroons. 
91,"L'opera is pastry heaven. A beautiful shop to dart into, when you want to get rid of the crowd at Select City or when you simply cannot resist the smell of a pattisserie anymore, just enter and surrender yourself to sweet goodness. I always order an almond tart, along with an Opera (my fav). This time I tried the Far Breton, which wasn't something I liked, but it was sweet and filled with dates so finished it anyway. Macarons too aren't something I go for, but they are pretty awesome here. "
92,"L'OPERA This is one place I never miss when in delhi .Just for their Croissants , they are awesome . Reminds me of The Table and Suzzette Mumbai . But this place has its own charm.Gr8 aroma of coffee and other Patisserie the moment you walk in.They have some amazing Preserve as well. Tried the combo which was cofee , croissant and orange cinnamon confiture. Awesome.Will be coming again and again as lots to try.Wow !!"
93,"There is absolutely no competition for Big Chill when it comes to the desserts, but this is one place that comes quite close in the variety and taste it has to offer. The look and feel of this place is somewhat french and some research conveyed that the french embassy had a role to play in setting up this franchise in Delhi. It's a small place at the outset of select city which has little seating arrangement for it's patrons.It's so difficult to pick a dessert because every single thing looked fascinating but we had to settle for one dessert each. We had a lemon tart, chocolate treasure and a truffon. I am not a fan of lemon tarts but this one felt relatively better to me. The...read more"
94,"Tried the chocolate tart here. The after taste left a lot to be desired. There seems to be some sort of a push from the eatery to introduce new items on a frequent basis, which kind of is making it difficult for L'Opera to maintain standards it was once famous for."
95,The desserts are really great and give us the taste of France. Though a little overpriced. I liked the royal chocolate. I think the macaroons shd b larger in size. 
96,"My friends sweet tooth got us to L'Opera which is located conveniently in select city walk (among other places). The bakery is doesn't have much seating space inside...but wow have a look at their offerings and you are for sure blown away...Out of there humongous menu, I had lemon tart with meringue, chocolate brownie, salty caramel éclair and a cup of cappuccino...The salty caramel éclair is one of a kind thing and I really enjoyed devouring it 😊.  Lemon tart and the cappuccino too were amazing. However the chocolate brownie was a little too chocolaty for me and was more like a chocolate fudge cake. On an earlier visit it had tasted some of there macaroons...which were mind...read more"
97,"Best bakery in Delhi. Truely French by mature. Their pear tart, lemon tart, almond tart, fresh fruit tarts, macaroons, breads..all are of international quality. "
98,Best known for its macaroons . The bakery serves delicious deserts. They are moist and soft. The place is small but offers proper sitting. A bit expensive .
99,"Their pasties are really good. I guess everyone should try them My favourites are fruit tart, Danish and the l'opera signature cake which is very rich in chocolate But there is a lemon tart which I recently tried and it was bad it was sticky and tangy which was not up to my taste "
100,"They have a huge variety of cakes and pastries and baked products. But its overly priced. The pastries are not very fresh but mousse and mal voie etc are divine in taste. Since its a french bakery, no wonder they do justice to french desserts."
101,"One of the best sweet dish one would.ever have.. there chocolate eclaires ,muffins ,tarts, cake etc are very yumm... The people might find it over prized but it is worth it ... "
102,Desserts and sandwiches get a 5 - but unfortunately always out of stock. The baguette sandwiches were delicious but now they mostly keep ciabatta. Wish they were better stocked - always out of options. 
103,"I had looked at the place a zillion number of times but each time I crossed it, it was just not time for a cup of coffee or a croissant. Until finally it was!Now, I had some real high expectations from the place. I had read the reviews and it looked like one of those places which will serve great bakery items.So I ordered a cup of cappuccino, a cheese croissant and 5 macaroons (all different flavours). The coffee was good, the cheese croissant was mind-blowing (one of the best I have had! And I have had many!), and the macaroons were terrible. Whatever I ate were not macaroons! I had macaroons for the first time in London and I fell in love with them. When I ate what I ate here, I...read more"
104,"L'opera replicates the typical European  cafe ambiance and taste. I was always allured by the items displayed in their outlets especially the macarons. One evening due to heavy rains we were stranded inside the mall and were roaming around aimlessly. Our craving for some dessert and hot cup of coffee led us to L'opera. We ordered a combo of coffee and a raspberry Macaron. It was very light, the crust was soft and not very crunchy. It had retained certain moistness. The berry flavour was outstanding. The coffee was okay. Nothing exceptional. They also have different types of breads. Try their gig bread."
105,"You first eat everything with your eyes. You take another round, thinking what to eat and what not to. Each single dessert looks so tempting that you want to grab everything on display and taste it one by one. Unfortunately, you have to select one or two from the available ones and try the remaining ones in subsequent visits. It's a small bakery in Select CityWalk with just three tables but a good variety of desserts. We ordered a pizza and blueberry cheesecake. If you are a big fan of tomatoes, you'll like it. But you'll love cheesecake anyway. A downside - staff is not very helpful. In fact, they need to be trained on how to behave with the customers. However, if you can ignore this...read more"
106,"This sweet little patisserie in CityWalk facing the foyer offers such delicious pastries, cakes, macaroons, quiches and freshly baked breads. It a place to grab a quick bite while you don't want to go to the busy coffee shops or food court and wait a lot. My personal favourite are butter croissant, chicken quiche and mushroom quiche. The staff is courteous and the place is clean and done up like a street French cafe. The pastries are fresh and breads feel like straight out if the oven!"
107,One of the best bakeries in the city. The macarons are delicious with almost all other delicacies which are excellent. Good staff but seating space is small. The raspberry mousse was the best they had and was exotic. 
108,They serve really delicious and fresh delicacies especially the pastries. One of my friend gifted me a pastry from this place and I fell in love with it. I don't exactly remember its name. Looking forward to try some more pastries from this place.
109,"it tastes good iv bought stuff a couple of times with a itch!! but i am not going back, no way i am paying 500 rs for a pastry again....really not worth it.....french patisserie and all the glamour that comes with it is great and honestly i like their stuff but prices are way to high..other places serve equally good stuff at half the price..."
110,"I always looked at the place like a five star bakery with its fancy interiors and sky high prices and it is one too!I didn't know what was good so I asked the sales attendants present there to suggest something Good and they gave me what was one of their highest selling 'signature pastry'. It was served in a fancy way looking very tasty and tempting but when I tried it I was again reminded of the phrase 'looks can be deceiving'. The pastry was stale, bland and very bad in taste. I pointed this out to the sales attendants and they said that it was freshly made. After that I could not gather the courage to try another one.The seating area is nice and so is the service due to which I...read more"
111,"Fancy looking place.... a french bakery with nice presentation of the bakery items .. i m not a macaroon person but i only i love the colorful stack of them lying on the shelf ... tried the coffee éclairs and couple of other things,its ok .. "
112,"Before writing the review,let me tell you that I'm in love with the name of this place. Very French. They serve really delicious and fresh delicacies especially the pastries. One of my friend gifted me a pastry from this place and I fell in love with it. I don't exactly remember its name(I'll be posting a picture so you can check). Looking forward to try some more pastries from this place.One should definitely give it a try. "
113,"They have the best macaroons all over delhi. This place never fails to impress me. Be it their sandwichs or desserts, they stand out every time. :D"
114,"Exotic & Luxurious bakery I have ever been to!  Apple Tart was simple awesome. Yes It is a place, where eyes melt with loads of Tarts - The orange tart, Aaah i remember! I visited some month back with my sister. Must say Lo'perá is heaven for people like me with a sweet tooth."
115,Excellent...you just can't stop at one..really yummy and perfect deserts... Only problem is the space...very less seating space...but the deserts are worth eating even standing...and that's exactly what I did!!!!!!!.....please please increase the seating  space..
116,"Exotic is the word. Really!I had tried the famed macarons from here but yesterday had these fulfilling gorgeous sinful beauties... First I died at the sight of them and after I ate them...rather gobbled them down...I died again! That good. Just a tad bit expensive. I mean I could get some 10 more patisserie products in the same amount from any of the other decent bakers around!The royal chocolate,truffon and opera were the one's I tried. They are KILLERRRR!!!My heart is stuck...so is the taste... I want more"
117,"Lovely desserts, i wish they had a bigger seating space! Staff is ok, not very helpful or suggestive. Tried their white chocolate dome- which is very delicious and isn't overpowering-sweet."
118,"""Overpriced"" Don't get me wrong but what else you expect in selectcity walk.Now coming to deserts, I tell you they've got some really exotic deserts your tongue will die for. They serve some Really silky and yummy pastries and on that the music will do the Magic"
119,"A French patisserie that you will want to visit again. The friendly staff and ambience makes for a great place to sit down and talk. The caramel custard cake, mocha chocolate cake, chocolate and caramel salted macaroons are some of the best desserts. Loperá is heaven for people with a sweet tooth. "
120,L'opera makes the most authentic french confectionery. The lemon tart and macarons are tremendously tasty. Good coffee. Five star quality on the mall side. 
121,Highly overpriced!!had a strawberry pastry for around 350rs and was not even good .. variety is cool but that too not great as compared to many other outlets in the town ..place is nice but no value for money 
122,"Try the Raspberry mousse its amazing. The desserts look good and taste even better. You can however give the macroons a miss, they aren't all that great. Looking forward to trying more stuff here."
123,"After finishing my lunch,  I walked around and shopped a bit.Result? Hungry again -.-So decided to try this place out as I've been hearing a lot of good things about this place from my friends. Order:Royal Chocolate.Full marks for the presentation here.A nice outer coating of dark chocolate with chocolate mousse inside on top of an almond biscuit layer. I liked the concept of using slightly contrasting flavours. Taste was pretty good I would say. Considering this a dessert, it was totally worth it.Americano.Pretty standard black coffee for my caffeine kick. Nothing wrong here.Damage - Rs. 423 (all inclusive)Overall:A nice modern bakery.Staff is polite and has adequate...read more"
124,"The best bakery in town, without a doubt. Hands Down!!  Go here when you're sad and I guarantee you'll come out happy!! Warning : The pastries and tarts you get here are seriously addictive. "
125,"I tried just one dish here. The lemon tart. It has a certain acidity to it. Every bite is a little sweet and a little sour. Definitely, not something our taste buds are accustomed to. Overall, a tasty tart. "
126,"Overpriced, but one of the best bakeries I've had been to. One more thing to be noted here is that I did not found the seating arrangement to be comfortable, but that's just personal. "
127,Although its quite heavy on the pocket. But still the service is nice and i tried chocolate royale which was pretty amazing .Must for those with a sweet tooth :)
128,"This is your regular French bakery, but French it is ! From the butter to the dough they are all flown in. That explains the crazy high prices. But if you can put the price aside and focus on the taste .... Phew ! Mind numbing :) We finally get some good bread in Delhi ! The pastries are fantastic.And the yummiest are the almond croissants.  Forget the calories and just indulge . "
129,"An overrated and expensive Bakery in short to begin with… As for the services it's okie.. But quite expensive for the portion…. Ate Apple Cinnamon Individual where I could taste only cinnamon no apple,priced at 210  .. Then Truffon Individual was yummy, heavy and rich, priced at 270… Just about okie experience , sadly wont recommend … Tax amount - 60  Service Tax amount - 23.73 Gross Amount - 563.73…."
130,"L'Opera is one best french patisseries in Delhi serving some delicious macarons, eclairs and french desserts.

131,"If u are sweet/dessert lover well you must hop at l'opera.Its a typical italian bakery where you get variety of breads ,pastries and macroons.Choclate and almond croissants are must have.Also o'pera signature pastry .I can assure you eat anything here you'll surely love it."
132,"L'Opera is a very english place. It is their in select city walk mall. I have tried its raspberry mousse which is literally the most exciting and amazing mousse i have tried ever. You will feel as if you are in the seventh heaven and angels are serving you. The moment I entered it, i was awestruck after seeing the brilliant display of the pastries and mousse. The staff their were so kind and generous. I asked them for a permission to click the mousse and they didnt say no to me, rather they were like 'why not?'. The male staff even added whether he could click it for me. I love this place from yesterday onwards ????????"
133,Apple cinnamon is the best they have.
134,Loved the Macarons. Salted Caramel and Pistachio.
135,"One of the few patisserie in Delhi where you get Macrons which are small donut shaped sweets available in different flavoura. I went there coz I heard this place is expensive but worth it. Well, it wasn't. They make regular bakery stuff like cakes and bread very well but you're not spending a bomb to go there and have a blackforest. The macrons, choclate eclair and all those exclusive stuff was not prepared as it should be. Sometimes, the crust was soft or the macron just crumbled in my mouth. For first tomers, ots ok but for someone who has an eye for detail, the place is super duper hyped. You could give it a moss and not regret."
136,"Some would find this place too expensive. So did I. But the quality of stuff you get here is matchless for that price. I have only bought birthday cakes for friends and family and I have never ever been disappointed. Although I am disappointed about the fact that the Royal Chocolate Cake has been discontinued due to shortage of raw materials as I was told. So those of you who haven't tried that yet, pray that their supply problem is solved soon so that you can treat your taste buds."
137,"The Danish here is out of this world! It is my personal favourite. L'opera is one of my favourite boulangerie. Yes, it is expensive but i believe its worth it. Should try out the Grenoblois bread made of walnuts n raisins, the Royal Chocolate is heavenly and the macarons keep you wanting more. If you haven't been to this place, you should. The stuff in this place melts in your mouth."
138,"I have been to this place a lot of time. Their menu spread looks fantastic and the whole French bistro theme works quite well. However in a large selection of desserts, all the tastes are same. All have the same custard, same pastry base, similar macaroon toppings, same chocolate mousse. Just different permutations of the same stuff. What they need is a much more variability of taste. If u visit this place next time I advice ordering macaroons, one chocolate base dessert and one custard based. And trust me u would have sampled the entire menu. I love the chicken quiche and raspberry macaroons here . Although the macaroons stick to your teeth they are the ones available in the name of...read more"
139,"When I first came to Delhi, I heard all the rave about L'Opera as far as desserts go.  Sadly, I was disappointed.  The prices were quite high for the portions and quality of food they served.  The tartes are the best tasting desserts in the restaurant.  The breads are decent, but the cakes and cookies are a bit dry.  There are much cheaper and tastier dessert places in Delhi, so feel free to pass up this patisserie."
140,All the cakes and the macarons specially are really tasty and yummy!
141,"In a city of not-many-famous bakeries, L'Opera stands tall! With now 4 outlets in Delhi and one in French Embassy, L'Opera has successfully catered to the expat community, the sophisticated middle & upper class and the big foodies of Delhi!Although, I am not much into sweet things (literally & otherwise), I couldn't resist visiting L'Opera after visiting there base kitchen in Noida. I loved the sugar-hearts I was offered when I visited the place. One thing I can ensure, the food quality & Hygiene is absolutely top-standard!I was able to chose the right things, courtesy a french friend, and I loved whatever we ordered. I never had good macrons, but L'Opera guys really get it right (try...read more"
142,Totally agree with Stuti. one tiny macroon for Rs.135. waste of money. 
143,One tiny macaroon for Rs 135 and 500ml of water for 50 bucks. Did not tickle my taste buds at all. Plus severe heart burn after hearing the price.
