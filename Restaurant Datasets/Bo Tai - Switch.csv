,Bo Tai - Switch
0,The location of this place is very peaceful and away from all the cannaught place chaos. The ambience is very vibrant and dynamic. All the dishes that I order tasted really good. Highly recommended if you're an Asian food lover. 
1,"It's not really the fault in the place, I believe I went in with very high expectations. The place is beautiful with spacious indoor and outdoor seating. It always booked so you need to be on the guest list. The cocktails were the start for us while the food was not really all that Bo Tai-sh. We felt dissatisfied specially with the 'Jaggery Tamarind Lamb'. Rest, it's location is proof of the place's grandeur."
2,Had the pleasure of dining in this beautiful establishment.From drinks to food Bo Tai Switch has it all.Loved the ambience and the attention paid to each patron is noteworthy.Kudos to the staff.Will definitely recommend this restaurant to all who want to have an amazing dining experience.PS - Pepperoni pizza is a must have. The thin crust along with the gourmet pep slices are AMAZING!
