2,Went for lunch. Ordered zucchini spaghetti after taking recommendation from the server. It turned out to be shredded zucchini in the form of spaghetti for almost 1000 bucks üôÅ
3,"Well, others have done a better job at reviewing than I can. So, quickly - food is awesome, ambience is awesome, service is awesome. Given the taste, the pricing is good as well. The only negative point was the portion size - I feel that the potion size of the dishes should be larger in general. We were left feeling hungry after an appetizer and main course. Otherwise, it's a must visit place "
4,"Finally i got something new after covid 19 pandemic...Day before yesterday i visited ROOH,Mehrauli Restaurant which is facing towards the qutub minar...with my wife to celebrate our anniversary...I was completely surprised,and the way they treated us ...amazing.So now come to the food part...we started our evening with the chef tasting menu with great cocktail by IZLER THOMAS.....The way server was telling stoies about each and every dishes in chef tasting menu was great..value for money100% satisfactionbeautiful romantic placegreat foodgreat servicekeep it up guys..."

6,Been there on a Friday night doesn't remember the date however it was a DJ baithak night. They have a beautiful terrace with magnificent Qutub view. Have order couple of starters from there new new menu. Both were upto my palate. Even cocktails were worth trying. While leaving been to there kitchen which was quite huge and open and hats off the staff as the kitchen was spike and span. Best part was kitchen is visible from most of the restaurant which gives them an upper hand in this pandemic when everyone is looking for cleanliness and hygiene. Can't wait to vist again to try rest of the menu. Would be back soon.
7,"Where: RoohWhat: Tandoori Chicken Breast, Neer Dosa, Khamiri Roti, Potato Pave, Zucchini Spaghetti, Minced Boiled Potatoes with Aaloo dum Gravy.I haven't done this in a while now. I've previously reviewed Ichiban (April 2019). This is a new addition after a long long time‚Ä¶Tandoori Chicken Breast: I love chicken anyway, and these were soft and succulent and very very good. They were served with Neer Dosa, Khamiri Roti and some gravy (I don‚Äôt remember the name of the gravy now) The whole set was pretty nice - and they also ask you ‚ÄúHow is the food‚Äù to which I smiled and said‚Ä¶""Khaane to do bhaai"" he smiled and never came back.

8,"Romantic Place which is quite spacious with a comfortable seating area. It's the perfect restaurant for a romantic date with bae for a memorable wine and dine experience. Their well-lit ambience will leave you awe-struck and of course, their exquisite meals will definitely satiate your hunger pangs. Their friendly staff will make sure you won't leave disappointed."
9,"Rooh is a must visit! Ambience, food, music , service- 5 star. Special shout to Mukesh & Nigam for their service üòäüëç"
10,"Went for my parent‚Äôs anniversary today after high recommendations from all known friends. And got a pathetic service by Mukesh, who ruined the entire night with his negative attitude towards serving his guests. Decided to leave without eating."
11,"Another Covid Dineout and what a fantastic experience. We did a-la-carte and not the tasting and ate probably all the items on the menu üôÉEvery dish was top notch. Also, cocktails were exceptional. Had some of the best cocktails in recent times. Staff was courteous. I honestly can‚Äôt find any fault in the place. Perfect view of the Qutub along with exceptional food and drinks. "
12,"If you want an 'Experience', like never before, just visit this place. Its located exactly besides Qutub Minar in a heritage site location.Chef Amit personally assisted in choosing the dishes and with one by one served unique dishes like never before. International and Indian Dishes forked in 'Rooh' style.! The way you end your dinner is a secret.! Must try.P.S: Do book a table before visiting :)"
13,"This is perfect for date and dinner outing too. I personally love this place and its food too. This fine-dining International Indian restaurant and bar is in Mehrauli, New Delhi. This Qutab-facing restaurant is set in a 150-year old haveli with white¬†..."
14,This place is a complete Michelline star experience of progressive Indian cuisine. A must visit place for everyone. No words to describe the most amazingly delicious food they serve. 
15,Booked a table with pre order birthday platter It was not organised on arrival untill asked n reminded 3 times hence surprise turned general order spoiled whole experience 
16,"Went here to celebrate my birthday. The ambience is beautiful. I would recommend you to visit this place if you are on a diet! Because the portions are extremely less. We had to convince ourselves that we are full as the place is overpriced for the quantity they serve. For the sake of birthday celebration, a tinie tiny slice of cake was given from their side, it was tasty but again, if you're a foodie, try avoiding this place üòäTo summarise-Visit here if you are looking for great ambiance, on a diet and are ready to spend some good chunk of money in the name of ""fine dining"", because some 5stars serve better quantity than them!"
17,"I am in love with this place and ambience, nd the best part is the Staffs , lovely ppl.. especially the Mukesh nd Nigam thanks guys nd stay safe ..üòò "
18,"We ordered the 12 course meal and everything was worth every penny. Amazing concept food, especially the passion fruit pani puri and the chicken roulade. Great time, beautiful ambience. Perfect for dates and family dinners.The junior chef personally explained us every dish while we waited for the next."
19,"Went to Rooh to celebrate a special occasion. The restaurant boasts of high reviews, so our expectations were also high. We opted for the 10 course meal. The courses were plated elegantly and seemed quite interesting. The portions were just enough to give a tease into the flavours. Our server very politely explained each course & it‚Äôs significance to us as we enjoyed oohing and aahing over the beautiful plates. We thoroughly enjoyed the first couple of courses as well as the last few courses, with the ones in the middle starting to loose the (flavour) plot. However, the experience at Rooh isn‚Äôt much different from Masala Library, or Indian accent, and if you have been to either, you...read more"
20,"The food, innovation, taste, ambiance, and the staff are pillars for the success of a restaurant and you to be impeccable in all arenas to catch hold of your market in a place like Delhi which is too overcrowded and ROOH has everything around is amazing here.Food has so much innovation done by chef Sujan and the taste is by far the best I had in past 6 months, pricing is just genuine and service has no complaints, which in all make my experience worth for this place, I do highly recommend all to visit for a revisit"
21,Good  food
22,In short des r the three things to knw1) the ambience is classy2) the food is excellent 3) the servers r amazing
23,"Rooh delivered probably the best meal I‚Äôve had in Delhi for a year. The setting is gorgeous. Our server was superb - knowledgeable, courteous and confident.¬†The avacado bhel and the Pork belly again is a experience in itself. In the mains the cuts of chicken is a unique take on butter chicken and the dal makhni along with the khameeri Roti just makes the moth water."
24,"I visited with my husband on his birthday and we tried the chef's tasting menu. The food creations were quite innovative, however, in terms of taste they missed the mark. While the flavor profile was good, there was not even one stand out dish. As a whole, the menu is well rounded, but definitely nothing extraordinary! No enticing flavors that would want you to come back for more. The food is just good, not great yet. The desserts were much better than the appetizers and mains though. I would definitely recommend the chef's menu at Indian Accent over this. However, our service was impeccable and a special mention to our server- Heba, who was not only knowledgeable, but also witty and...read more"
25,Went to Rooh with my husband for our anniversary dinner and oh boy we were completely awed by the food. I am a big fan of innovative modern indian food and everything we ate there was just that! The taste of everything that we tasted was explosive and bang on. The staff was super courteous and the ambience was lovely and very romantic. Would love to visit again. I would highly recommend this place to everyone. Good job and good luck Team Rooh.
26,"A beautiful restaurant situated at mehrauli with amazing food service , food menu and great ambience,the only thing i felt was their deserts are not that great,rest all perfect ,god bless"
27,"Rooh, after creating a buzz in New York, Chicago and San Francisco, Chef Sujan Sarkar dazzles yet again. Chef Sujan has taken local Indian flavours from across India and created art with each one of them. The flavours are relatable and familiar. Yet, the play of textures, amalgamation of flavours and ingredients in so unique."
28,"Rooh delivered probably the best meal I‚Äôve had  in Delhi for a year.   The setting is gorgeous.   Our server was superb - knowledgeable, courteous and confident.   What an asset.   And the food..   Just outstanding.  From avocado Bhel (a riot of textures in the chat style with the unmistakeable whiff of Bengal) to duck seekh and a deep rich lamb shank made even better with the addition of dark chocolate.  Everything we had was spot on.   Rooh isn‚Äôt cheap but quality rarely is.   5 stars without hesitation."
29,"A big shoutout to this place! We happened to come across this place and wanted to have desserts. Unaware of the timings, we came around 4 pm (place is closed) however the staff (Nigam) went out of the way to call us inside and offer us desserts. We ordered a besan barfi opera dessert and it was totally worth the money! Loved the ambience, service and food and will definitely visit again."
30,I am a big fan of tasting menu‚Äôs. Rooh gave me a chance to try a modern indian food tasting menu. We were seated at the corner table with a direct view of the qutub minar.The dishes served were beautifully plated and were a culinary delight.The service was exemplary. The servers were well versed with the menu and explained each dish in detail.The wine pairing was good too.Unfortunately one ends up comparing the food to Indian Accent or the drama to chef sujans previous ventures like Tasting Lab.And thats where Rooh falls short. None of the dishes stood out. It was a nice meal but one expected more.
31,"Amazing amazing amazing chefs menu!! It's actually playing with you palate combined with blowing your mind. With such amazing service and polite servers ,your meal will only get better. Luckily got the most corner table with the direct view of the Qutub minar! The only thing I would suggest you to improve was the Daal..it was bland as compared to the explosion of the entire menu."
32,"Fine dining at its best. Flavourful meals and novel textures. Truly international Indian cuisine.Tasting menu is worth every penny and the portions size is more than filling. I highly recommend Chaat, liquid corn bhurji and mushroom Galouti.Staff is extremely friendly yet professional and the service doesn‚Äôt disappoint. Special mention to Gaurav for serving us well! Thanks!"
33,"People might disagree with the portion sizes, but that‚Äôs what the key is. I was rightfully guided by the servers to order items that compliment each other and due to the small portions, the appetite was enough to have a hearty meal with various flavours. Another thing I would compliment is the selection of the drinks based on the spirits you prefer. Let them curate your thirst and am sure you will be satisfied. Can‚Äôt say what was the best, because the meal with all its dishes turned out to be a full course of deliciousness."
34,Luxury dining with sophisticated ambience..Just loved the details given of each and every dish very perfectly by the members over there!! The taste of food was combination of indian cuisine modified in an innovative way!! Presentation of dishes were amazingüëçüèªPerfect to go for dinner date!!
35,"Thank you for an extraordinary evening. The service, the staff, the food - everything was fantastic!Will be visiting very soon."
36,Me and my husband went to Rooh for our Anniversary. Away from the chaos of city this place is full of peace  with a beautiful view of Qutub Minar . Perfect Romantic Dinner date place.

38,After all the research finally decided to take my husband here for his birthday. This place is so amazing and the food is so tastefully with innovation. The view from the window is so peaceful and you can have a glimpse of the qutub minar. Must try for all the food lovers.
39,"Taste, appearance, texture and smell of the dishes were incredible. Enjoyed the experience. As soon as one enters Rooh, the open space hits you. It's unlike any restaurant in Delhi. With a bar serving up unparalleled cocktails and infusions. The hospitality gives you one a sense calmness and what hit me as I entered the dining space was the open kitchen. Once could see  right through the glass wall. The cleanliness and passion which drove the chefs to serve a perplexing 7 course menu with a combination of flavors was utterly delicious. I devoured each bite as I scraped each morsel of my plate. The pairing of wines with each course was done with perfection as it amplified the flavour of...read more"
40,"The restaurant which set up shop successfully outside India now in Delhi. It‚Äôs located against the backdrop of Qutub Minar and offers a great view of the monument. The entry is slightly less visible, so one needs to keep a close tab. The interiors are minimalistic with the white and golden setting it‚Äôs bright and cheerful. The service is extremely attentive without intruding into privacy.It‚Äôs a small menu, but offers variety for vegetarians and non vegetarians alike. Traditional Indian food served with a twist yet retains the authenticity and soul of the dish taking it to the next gastronomic level. Tried the mutton burrah which was shallow fried with fantastic flavours served...read more"
41,Full points for the location and the service. Ideal for a lazy comfortable evening. 
42,"The presentation of the food was superb. Everything came plated with superb use of modern culinary techniques and was done as required. I loved the starers - the yoghurt chart, avocado bhel. The mains were again very well plated and paneer was rolled super thin, however i found the curry not that great. As far as the pepper curry was concerned it was super. The dessert milk cake plated again well was average in taste. However the overall experience was superb. Havent seen any place like this in India so far !!! "
43,Restaurant will set the benchmark of dining experience in country. Everything plated to perfection and an exemplary display of culinary techniques. 
44,"I visited this newly opened modern indian cuisine restaurant- ROOH. A very fabulous evening along with my wife. As per the recommendation, i chose there Chef's Tasting Menub that turned in to perfect meal for the evening. My favourites from the tasting menu was the Lamb pate gourgere, sweet corn bhurji, duck shami( the best shami kebabüòç) and the main course- lamb chops( swallah!!‚ù§).The presentation itself is tempting and the taste is palatable. I am not much of a sweet person but after trying Rooh Desserts, I am in love. And staff is very courteous and a friendly environment.

45,"Rooh, the most beautiful property for me located in Mehrauli gives you an amazing ambience and the best view one could get of the Qutub Minar.Also about the food, one cannot find a better malai chicken tikka than the one served here. Their yogurt chaat is just so tangy and one of the best I have had because to be honest I am not a yogurt fan but the one served here was amazing.You won‚Äôt find a better place here in Mehrauli to have a great time."
46,The place is a complete Michelline star experience on traditioinal Indian food. Rooh as the name suggest is a endevaor by Master chef Sujan to Give an all togather different experience of traditional Indian Food while keeping the Soul of the Food intact. The experience is completely different and is both a visual and a gastronomical take on the otherwise traditional Indian Food. The yogurt chat consisting of 5 different textures of yogurt is a all togher different take on the otherwise traditonal dahi. The avacado bhel and the Pork belly again is a experience in itself. In the mains the cuts of chicken is a unique take on butter chicken and the dal makhni along with the khameeri Roti just...read more
47,"One of the finest,. place for a gastronomical experience of fusion Indian Food. The experience is completely Michelline star .The location itself opposite the qutub is a experience in itself. Coming to food chef Sujan and left no stone unturned to give one an experience of a lifetime with his unique take on the traditional Indian Food. Started off with the yogurt chaat which consist of different textures of yogurt and is a must have, equally good is the avcado bhel which is a unique take on the Bhej puri .In the mains the cuts of chicken with the khamiri bread is to die for.The rasmalia 2.0 again is a unique mixture of Ra's malai and Daulat kein Chat .A must visit Place for Sure."
48,"We went there for a family lunch. The decor is not overdone and has a Mediterranean look. Quite simple and elegant.After opening in San Francisco and Chicago, Chef Sujan Sarkar has opened a Rooh in our very own Delhi!We are vegetarians and ordered the starters and got talking. Shortly thereafter, we were served a rice papad infused with activated charcoal as a taster. It was delicious. I got intrigued about the activated charcoal.

Service, food, ambiance everything just perfect.Servers, Manager, hostess even chefs were so courteous and nice. Special mention for the manager, Mr Vivek who arranged the cake on such a short notice. We loved dahi chaat, lamb burrah, tandoori chicken and rasmalai in dessert. Highly recommended place for all the foodies. "
63,"Dining at ROOH is akin to experiencing a culinary theatre where the chefs and service come together to present a production that is nothing short of exemplary. Even though I say theatre, the food isn‚Äôt gimmicky. It‚Äôs a fine presentation of nostalgia served on a plate. Come here if you want to be wowed not just by the quality of food served, but by the interpretation of familiar Indian dishes presented in an international avatar. A word about the service - it is warm, informed and attentive but never obtrusive. The kind folks at ROOH are reinventing our favourites only to make us fall in love with it all over again.

66,The place is over hyped rather than serving good gastronomic food it's a place that is serving beautiful dishes with average taste at exorbitant prices in an upscale location. More than food it's a place where people want to been seen. It's a take from Gagan's from Bangkok and the ever famous Indian Accent but it doesn't come close to any. The servers push you to eat the chefs menue as that's what probably most of the people order and the dishes come out quickly but as soon as you order something from the Alacart it takes forever to come to the table.chicken malai- 5/5Rest everything we ordered was average and nothing I would like to be paying 1200 for a dish.

A very unique dish and tasty.Desserts their carrot halwa cake is a must try.
69,"I recently visited Rooh and was spellbound by the beautiful direct Qutub view.The ambiance is very light and classic, just perfect for a lunch!The concept of the restaurant is the fusion of authentic Indian dishes with International cooking methods which gives it a modernized touch. Their take on the methods of fusion are just surprising!Some of my favorite dishes from their menu are-1. Yoghurt chaat2. Lamb burrah3. Chicken malai tikka4. Paneer Pollichathu with Neeer dosa5.

Started off with amushe bouche which was basically masala papad with 5 types of chutney that was soo good. Then what i really loved was their zucchini spaghetti, pumpkin rissoto, rice idli, green tea roti. They have literally thought out of the box and the food is soo good. I'm sure you will love it too"

75,This was my second visit to ROOH..the first time I tried the tasting menu I wasn't impressed where the presentation exceeded the palate taste. Today we were 4 of us and ordered alacarte mostly vegetarian along with our gin tonics and it was an excellent experience. Today not only the presentation but the taste was par excellence and we ate till we felt that we would burst. A special mention to Feba our waitress who served us like our mother in law and was extremely attentive to our requirements and detailing. The food experience was fantastic due to her. Kudos to team ROOH..keep on innovating. Cheers!
76,I have got to start with excellent service and extremely attentive staff. Our server was Deepak who gave good recommendations and the pastry chef sought feedback on the dessert. The food was leaning towards modern Indian and the best was the Besan Barfi dessert. We had not eaten anything like it before this. The ambience and seating is spacious and inviting. Do try the Kale and Cucumber gin cocktail. 
77,"mastering the beauty of making up a perfect dish lies beside this place located in mehrauli. The art of making it to the perfection lies beside the chef who curates the dish.

78,"The service, staff and ambience at Rooh are wonderful but even the most charming staff and elegant decor cannot do anything about truly bad, un-imaginative, over-priced food.The only dish I enjoyed was the Malai Tikka Terrine. It was really good. The Kombucha & Pomegranate mocktail was also excellent - very unusual. It is truly pungent and takes a few sips for your palate to get used to but after that it is fabulous. I also liked how the glass was spiced/salted down until where the drink is poured rather than just the rim - it really adds to the flavour.¬†The rest of our meal, unfortunately, was a complete disappointment. We tried two other cocktails - a turmeric one that was bland...read more"

80,"I recently visited ROOH for lunch and sampled the Chef's special tasting menu. Chef¬†Sujan Sarkar¬†has taken the concept of modern Indian cuisine to next level. Izler Thomas¬†is the head mixologist here, and he is brewing magic behind the bar with drinks like Butter Old Fashioned which was my personal favourite. Kaapi Martini, which was made with Walnut Honey, Filter Coffee and walnut honey. Qutub One, made with barrel aged whiskey, and Kale & Cucumber which is their healthy take on G&T. Each cocktail is unique but the Butter Old Fashioned is highly recommended.Now coming to the food, began the course menu with Amla which would basically appeal to your senses. Passion Fruit Panipuri...read more"
81,"The food here is fantastic. There is no question about the quality of the fare so don‚Äôt think twice about going here unless it‚Äôs the end of the month and you haven‚Äôt got your pay check, or if there‚Äôs too much traffic or of course ... how do I put this politely ... if you‚Äôre broke. Between the three of us at lunch, we ordered a duck shammi, tenderloin carpaccio, mutton burra and a pork belly for starters. As I said earlier (and I will reiterate again numerous times in all likelihood), the quality of food was unquestionably fantastic. However, my pet peeve at places like this where you really do pay through your nose for food, is that when there are 3 people at the table, there...read more"
82,Mehrauli has been one of the most scenic locations in Delhi with the view of the iconic Qutub Minar and gorgeous restaurants like Rooh that keep on coming up in this area makes this place perfect for romantic dates. We had heard a lot of great things about Rooh and planned to visit them for a lunch on a weekend.
83,"One of the most phenomenal dining experiences one can expect in Delhi. The drinks were fabulous and the mixologist took the time to explain the technique behind his creations. We tried the veg & non veg tasting menu and the variety of flavours, textures and colours really encompassed a great dining experience. The service was the best, again that I've seen in Delhi. For anyone who hasn't been, you're seriously missing out. "
84,"First off, I would like to congratulate the staff on being extremely attentive and hands on. The service here is 5 star. The food didn‚Äôt quite do it for me though, average I would say. Adding to which was the heat on our table - it was so hot. üî• We did have a fun time despite the reasons above, though won‚Äôt be back."

Mehrauli now boasts of many fine dining eating places and this is one of its new stars.Located on the first floor, the decor is simple, elegant and pleasant. The seating area is tiny and you get a view of the kitchen too.Their menu is very innovative, giving Indian dishes a very modern and interesting twist.They started us off with 3 complimentary yoghurt chaat. This chaat was basically really fluffy and light yoghurt with spices and chutney mixed in giving it a semblance of the street chaats of Old Delhi.

Starting from the amla topped chutney to start to the dessert simply won my heart. They have a nice fusion touch to the dishes from around India like the pao bhaji from Maharashtra to the dosa from the south is served with their own touch. We loved how they have made changes to things but keeping the original flavours intact. Kudos to the team for curating what is not less than a feast!"
97,"Tried this new place on a Saturday night, and to our disappointment it wasn‚Äôt as buzzing as we thought. The layout of the restaurant is like a large family home, with several small rooms surrounding a bigger central one. We were seated in the private dining area, and it looked half-finished in decor with bare walls, dim lighting and a half window overlooking the roof with spare pipes and tins kept in the open. The ambience was not as dressed up as we were! We tried several cocktails since Rooh is a food and cocktail bar, but none of them came even close to the description. We decided to order off the menu for a LIIT but the confused look on the bartender‚Äôs face was a concern. The...read more"

Its a wonderful gift to the delhi people who loves to try something new and unique.I believe, they have recently started their regular menu but every single dish was just wow, tasty and nicely presented. Personally, I loved their own version of dahi ka chaat and lamb burrah and gajar halwa cake.Service top notch. Manager himself was so helpful and trying to describe the innovation and ideas behind the dishes.Will certainly come back soon for their tasting menu."

Everything was bang on. The staff was extremely courteous and explained each dish in detail. Will definitely repeat . If I had to give any suggestion it would be please have a more effective air conditioning. The rest you have nailed it

Encompassing a Special Chef‚Äôs Tasting menu for dinner and an ala cart menu available for lunch and dinner, Rooh manages to satiate with carefully cuarated bites, which are a culinary piece of work on its own. The food is rich in flavours and the quality of ingredients is top notch.
