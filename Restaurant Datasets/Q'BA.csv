0,"A pretty decent restaurant located in the inner circle of Connaught Place. The staff was courteous and the food was much more tastier than I ever expected! Ordered Roasted Chicken Pizza, Classic Steam momos and their famous pasty which Is a must have. Pizza had nice crust and was very filling. Momos were juicy and tasty and the pasty was so moist and yummy. Enough for two people.A must visit place for foodies.It costed approximately ‚Çπ2000 for two people. "
1,"It's on the second floor I guess, I was reading what was written on the stairs, which was fun. Then when you enter, the fanciness just wows you. It's a pretty big place. We got a comfortable sitting. And they made that there was ample space between two tables for the social distancing. Then we went for Keema Mat Pav, it was heavenly. So it comes with three pav. So if you want order more, they come as portions of three only. Also some wine, which was nice. It was a really great place which I would recommend to everybody."
2,"Everything is good here except the drinks- cocktails. The bar attendant does not know how to prepare liit. The one served to me was super sweet, had to send back twice to get the taste right, but wasn't upto the mark. Place is good, hygiene, and serves awesome food. "
3,Didn't honour Zomato pro . Manager made a mistake to club offer under happy hours and didn't notify us. A big blooper on their part .
4,Hi friends. I ordered sizzler and momos. But the flavour of the food not upto the mark. Ambience was great. staff was good.
5,"I went there last week along with my friends as i wanted to have a experience of fine dining thai cuisine. The staff was really friendly and polite, the food was good. I ordered thai spring rolls, thai chilli chicken and virgin mojito. Spring rolls were really great in taste, i really liked it. While thai chilli chicken was not as good as the normal chilli chicken that we have at other places. I didn't quite liked it. But overall it was a good experience. "
6,"Not a good place to go!Non-tasty food, pushy servers, staff is too bad.We went there for lunch and informed that we are Zomato pro members. Then we ordered 2 glasses of wine. Then the server forced us to have another round of wine and said it's happy hours and one plus one us applicable on all drinks. We then agreed. At the time of billing he informed us mam you are Zomato pro member so no happy hours for you. He double billed us and was not apologetic at all. Even duty manager was equally adamant. Guys this place is a trap!! Don't go there! They are showing their sales by committing fraud and being too pushy."
7,"I visited this place with my family, and was very skeptical as my dad is not very happy with live music scenes, but the delectable aroma inside as well as the old Bollywood classics ensured we had a great evening. The food was great but the ambience called for a great experience!!"
8,"So I dined at this place after almost 10 months and must say the food is as good as it was before pandemic . We had whole lot of food coz we all were too excited to dine out finally . We ordered hot n sour soup (family fav) , grilled sandwich (with eggplant in it which is a first for me) , chilly garlic noodle, honey chilly potato, vegetables in schezwan sauce and fried rice. Of all the things we had I loved the sandwich the most which I was skeptical of trying initially . Staff was courteous,were wearing masks and gloves. Hence our dine out was a absolute pleasure. Definitely going again üëçüèª "
9,Went to QBA after seeing the Zomato ratings and had high expectations but it turned out to be a not so good experience.Ordered sarson fish tikka and chickentikka masala n breadsFish tikka though soft and fresh was too salty which ruined the taste.Chicken tikka masala was not good it was quite ordinary. When you are paying such a big amount to a well renowned restaurant you expect it to be good.Will not go to QBA again . 
10,"Poor food and very bad treatment on bill, please don't dine her, you have much better options in CP. Go for locals"
11,"very bad quality food, not safe to dine in here, food is over priced. Manager is very selfish, i am never going back again"
12,"such bad quality food and higly selfish manager, please don't go for their food and drinks, i higly reccomend to never dine in here."
13,Very bad tasting food and unhygienic sitting. Really disappointed with their food and drinks. Not at all safe to dine in there. Please don't go to such place at the time of covid 
14,Went there yesterday and had such an awful experience. Super unhygienic and bad tasting food. I highly recommend to always skip going at this place. 
15,"Presently merging together Bercos and QBA, they have a common seating space with the same staff. Although the menu is different with separate kitchens.  Coming back to the food, it is mouthwatering but at the same time we cannot avoid it‚Äôs high pricing. The staff is courteous but takes time to get the orders. All over i ordered few things like pizza and Chinese which was up to the mark. Extra marks for the beautiful ambience with attractive lights. Pros- Good Food, Great StaffCons- Expensive, No discounts "
16,Great Bercos food as ever. Nice ambience. One would not go wrong choosing the place to dine with family and friends. And of course the staff are very professional. 
17,"The place has very good ambience, Its great for a weekend visit. The food is delicious specially the chicken pizza the only thing that disappoints me is the portion size."
18,This review is for Berco's since now Q'BA has collaborated with Berco's. My dine-in experience at the restaurant was amazing. The safety measures were followed very well and the staff was courteous enough to reach out to us. The social distancing norms were adhered-to religiously in spite of a waiting queue due to the weekend.What I ordered;Fruit Beer (4/5)Chilli Paneer (5/5)Chicken Manchow Soup (4.5/5)Veg. Manchow Soup (4/5)Chicken salt and pepper (4/5)Mongolian Chicken (4/5)Veg. Hakka Noodles (5/5)Veg. Fried Rice (4.5/5)
19,This is one of the best bar cum restaurant in CP. Ambience is soothing and food tastes great. Their cocktails are amazing. Starters and pizza taste heavenly.
20,I have nothing but praise for this spot. Some might not like the classy ambience but it's a perfect place for first date if you are the type to sit and talk. The food is good. Alcohol is little too expensive but well I it's never cheap to drink at good places. I drink and I know things. Oh and let's not forget the staff. On their toe ready to serve. KudosFood-5/5Drinks 4/5Ambience 5/5Staff 5/5
21,"It's an amazing fine dining restaurant, offering delicious food. Staff is courteous as well. You can a nice time with your family, as the waiters won't stand on your head to order quickly."
22,"Food was good, ambience was nice , courteous staff overall the best place"
23,"Really great service and tasty foodLoved the bell peppers fried corns and the tex mex basketIt had prawns, chicken wings, cheese poppers.Each of it was tasty and went well with beer.Good ambience also."
24,"Amazing place to spend time with your family and friends ! Located in the Center of Delhi and amazing Bar with Balcony to enjoy the view of Capital City! Having said that, the Cantonese cuisine is amazing where the spring rolls and Chili Chicken was also amazing !"
25,QBA is a proper family restaurant that has a classy ambient and manages to be pocket friendly as it offers great potion size. QBA has tied up with Bercos which helps in mutlifold food options.#ambience - 5/5#staff - 5/5#food - 4/5#location - 5/5
26,The place is great to hangout with friends.The waiters served good.Polite staff. Great experience . Would recommend
27,"This place is beautifully curated , nice options for food and drinks. Packed to the brim , hassles to get a seat there. I have visited many a times and have always been satisfied with them. Open terrace gives you a better view of our city . Thumbs up for this place."
28,QBA is such a great place to hangout with friends. The ambience is very good and the staffs always provide great service. Fresh and delicious food and the drinks are well done too
29,Centrally located at CP inner circle very spacious and comfortable place. The food quality is good and prices are moderate. Overall the place is good & have awesome interiors.Deserts were very good in taste
30,One of the best places in Delhi NCR. Perfect ambiance. With 2 floors and variety of dishes. Service was really great
31,"QBA has an amazing ambience and very friendly and sweet staff. The food here though can be improved. The California veggie pizza and the cheese sambosuek were delicious, wild mushroom risotto though can be improved. Loved the Bellini from their cocktail section. Would try some more and different dishes when I visit again."
32,i really loved their ambience and staff really good serviceü•∞
33,Food was good. Ambience was amazing but not giving 5 stars because I felt that the place was a little boring. They also need to improve there serving time.
34,"Whenever visiting a restaurant (with rating above 4) the first thing u expect is great food...rest all things are secondary..But sorry to say i was disappointed with food..There wasn't a single dish that was up to the mark..No particular dish to remember(btw we ordered 7 dishes and 3 different drinks) everything was average. The worst was the bbq chicken...The chicken was undercooked, though it was replaced after complaining.Coming to the ambience there is no doubt that the restaurant is spacious. But the nice ambience couldn't makeup for the average tasting food.The only thing by which i was really impressed was the washroom. It was really clean/hygienic and well equipped."
35,Blend in the savouring sweet and sour flavours of forever ‚ù§ The splendid taste of Aloo Tikki and the best street food right here at QBA.
36,"The chicken dimsums in red sauce we ordered were amazing, followed by the Chinese chop suey really helped us embrace the cool weather outside. Great ambience, friendly staff and really good food. This has become my new favorite in Connaught Place."
37,"The food is great! Really liked their service as well. Quiet and classy ambience. Good place for an official lunch, a nice evening with a date or a family dinner!"
38,"We were 4 people and ordered 2 Manhattan Dry Cocktail and 2 Red Sangria with some starters. After 15-20 mins starters came but no drinks. We were hungry so we started eating starters and finished but drinks din't come even after reminding them for 2-3 times. After around 40 mins, they came with only one Sangria. We said we ordered 3 other drinks as well to which they had no clue. They took another 5 mins to come to us saying they don't have Manhattan dry and gave us 2nd Sangria. Then we asked for wine which was again not available. There were only 4 wines im their menu and 2 were not available. So the ones available were of 800/- INR only. The 400/- and 500/- ones weren't available from...read more"
39,"This cafe located on cannaught place,The food is amazing, the atmosphere is really romantic. But it is a bit pricey. I would recommend it to couples or families that want to have a nice dinner out. Also the chandelier gives a really sophisticated vibe."
40,Have been there I love the ambience and the song played there we got the seat and staff took our order and it got delivered on the table late the service was quite slow .they should work on their taste and service.
41,A perfect five for the ambiance. The ambiance is mesmerizing. The food is equally good.
42,I would like to tell about their food's quality nd taste that #The amazing taste #something I never tasted I like thisüòãüòãüòã
43,"Hindi writer Nilotpal Mrinal was stopped from entering QBA restaurant at CP because he was wearing a Gamchha (‡§ó‡§Æ‡§õ‡§æ). This place has no right to do so. If they doesn‚Äôt care for diversity of India, don‚Äôt know what else they are selling. This Elite mentality is nothing but a blot on Delhi."

45,U should be ashamed of yourself that u dont allow indians in their indian style dresses.....
46,0/5 stars for the manager specially
47,Worst service and food..I never forget this restaurant in my life.... restaurant was not so much busy..but it took long time for my drinks and food..never visit again..
48,I went to this place on my birthday. And God what an experience it was. The ambience is top notch and the food was great too. 
49,And found cocoroach in the food noone should go there.
50,I just love its spring roll 
51,Great food and numerous menu options. Best part was the multiple cuisines available all under one roof.
52,I will suggest this place to people who don't like darker place and noisy place. Place is good. But no smoking room properly available there. People smoke on the stairs and bother the while coming people. Beers availablity was good when i visited. Staff behaviour was good. Food quality was good.
53,"Stunning spot for an incredible family eating experience.You can arrange from the Q'ba menu, just as the Berco's menu, which is additionally kept running by the Q'ba the executives at a similar spot. We requested Non Veg Mezze Platter. The second dish was Prawn Curry alongside noodles. Both the dishes were spot on taste, introduction and incentive for a delectable meal.The staff was respectful and served to our necessities. Prescribe to visit this spot both with your loved ones or even a date."
54,Ever seen a super loaded veggies and cheesy heaven? I've recently ate it here! I'm convinced that this was the best pizza I ever had. I'm choosy about base but this bread of joy had everything on point. Looved the food very much and ambience is ofcourse perfect.
55,"I love this place. It's one of my favorite places to eat. From Chinese to Indian everything is perfect. Be it their manchow soup, spring rolls, paneer Tikka, crispy corns, hakka noodles, risotto, mix veg roti. I have been to this place quite a few times now. Keep going and eating. As it's berco's so obviously their Chinese is suppose to be good and it is. "
56,"Visit this place would love to say class , spacious even i found it totally different from other places in cp. Loved it would love to visit again and again. Food taste up to the mark ‚ù§"
57,"Staff not at all courteous; if you go here forget about hospitality, because they believe in hostility. The Staff is quarrelsome and gets jittery particularly on dineout discounts.Irrespective of their ratings, I certainly believe that there are betters options to go to, in terms of service, food and discount. For those who are planning to visit this place - Your money is precious and more precious is your mood. Save it"
58,Good Food... Right Ambience. Service was friendly but can be prompt. It was used to be Italian but then served Thai food ;) Terrace was good option always but due to restrictions had sit inside.
59,"Lovely place for a great family dining experience.You can order from the Q'ba menu, as well as the Berco's menu, which is also run by the Q'ba management at the same place.Ordered Manchow soup, Chilly potato, Chicken salt and pepper (yum) Chilly paneer gravy (not good, paneer was hard) Chiily chicken gravy and Hakka noodles from Berco's menu.From the Qba menu, we ordered Dahi kebab (shallow fried, cheezy with soft outer, but i prefer mine deep fried with crispy outer layer), California pizza with extra vegetables (good, but kind of bland in taste), and Fish fingers ( super soft, delicious)Since we were 9 people, the only big table available was on the first floor. The service was...read more"
60,"I absolutely loved it. Amazing music, amazing ambience. Can't say anything about food coz we had two beers. And it was huge. It is in the heart of cannaught place."
61,"Preferred this place for a Sunday lunch with a friend. Knowing the goodwill and popularity of QBA, I preferred to call in for reservations in morning itself. The place was packed during lunch on both ground and 1st level.Food- We ordered Non Veg Mezze Platter. The 2nd dish was Prawn Curry along with noodles. Both the dishes were right on taste, presentation and value for a delicious meal.The staff was courteous and served to our requirements. Recommend to visit this place both with your friends and family or even a date. Shall be revisiting them soon.Food- 4/5Staff and Services- 4/5Ambience- 3.5/5Overall- 4/5"
62,Nice ambience. Decent place for outing with family but ordinary food. There was an insect in our loaded nachos which had to be replaced (not the insect but the dish !) 
63,I was recently at this place with my friends. I found this place. They had very well decorated ambience. Their lights and very unique. They had ample space inside it. Their menu is quite exquisite and well elaborated. All their dishes have very low level of spices yet they are very flavourful. Their staff gave us suggestions like what to order and what to expect. Their staff was well trained as well. Their service was quite speedy as well. Overall I had a great experience. Will be back for more
64,"The place is so good and decor is exceptional, they really put lots of money in it.Yellow lighting and good space. In the heart of city another good finding. Good¬†place for group dinner and family too. Energetic environment."
65,"Visited this place on a very special day! The ambience was too good,spacious with nice seating arrangement! Had a candle night dinner.. Took  mocktails- Strawberry Delight and Green Dream,the first one was better but the latter one tasted average..We had Quesedillas(yumm) and Penne Alfredo(3/5).. The waiters were courteous with a good service! Overall a good experience..A must try place!"
66,The food was very good at decent prices. There is a lot of variety in food and drinks. The ambience is very nice for a family outing or even to hangout with friends or for a date! This collaboration of QBA and Bercos is very good.
67,QBA in association with Bercos is one of the best places to look out for the Chinese and Indian food is just amazing Must try Schezuan DimsumsChilli Potato Thai Noodles 
68,One of the best restaurant in CP I came across. From inside it looks like a 5 star hotel. Class ambience. Ordered Spinach home made cottage cheese pasta and Mushroom mix vegetables. Both items were in ample quantity and taste delicious.I really liked that they have a seating arrangement for people in waiting. This restaurant is a must visit. Would come here again but next time in eveningOne thing I'd like to mention to staff that service was too slow. I don't know if that's a case on Sunday noons. 
69,Arranged an amazing party at this newly found place on my list and must say they have got some amazing packages for bookings.I tookSingle malt package which had a lot of things to enjoy in and was quite affordable too.Service waa great and so as the ambiance. Must visit place for sure. Food taste was awesome.
70,"I recently visited Qba in CP with my friends for dinner and quite loved the experience. The place is nicely decorated with ample sitting area. The ambience is well lit and very soothing. One of the main attractions is their unique menu. They have something for each and everyone here.Coming to the food, my top recommendations are -Bhatti ka murg : it‚Äôs a must have dish from the menu. Chicken was properly cooked, the flavours were perfect and well balanced.Corn cheese kebab: These were delectable and simply amazing in taste. Kebabs were perfectly cooked and just melt in the mouth in one bite .For mains, I loved their chicken tikka masala with tandoori roti. It was an amazing dish in...read more"
71,"Q'BA is best dine in restaurant in Connaught Place. Few days ago I visited with my friends. We like non veg snacks, you should try this here. Tandoori chicken wings and Amritsari fried fish are must tried snacks. They were juicy and delicious.For the main course we ordered all time favorite Dal makhani, Butter chicken with Butter Naan. Both dished in main course were delicious. Butter naan was soft and gravy was yam and tasted good with butter chicken."
72,"Q'BA is a perfect place to enjoy few drinks and snacks with your date. Last week I visited this outlet in Connaught Place with my Gf and she like this place more than me. On the recommendation of staff we ordered and all the ordered items were perfect in taste. We like the Chilly fish and Tomato basil cheese bruschetta. .Presentation was great. If you like lite snacks then you should try these bruschettas. Chilly fish was also good . Quality of fish was top class. Love this place, will come again."
73,They have a great ambience. Perfect for date night as well. The food is very tasty. You can also get great Chinese thanks to the affiliated Bercos. A great experience and very courteous staff.
74,"Q'B serves you with class food .It is located in cp and it is quite a place i had dinner over here there was music to groove and it is lovely to sit here and spend time with your near and dear ones .very spacious place with ample sitting , quality food and an amazing evening would reccomend to vist here"
75,"I love this place specially for food and ambience. If u want to talk over drinks and fill Ur belly with delicious food than this is the place. Good that they don't play loud music but enough to enjoy it When u not talking.I will give 1 minus for service, I had to ask for water, tissues, pickle, onion where it should be on table already..in my 3rd visit as well."
76,"This is such a nice cafe with amazing food. We went for a quick lunch and impressed with their quick service. I like the ambience of the pace and it was not dull lighted which I like most. They have ample seating area, we choose comfortable area for ourself.We ordered Dal Makhani, Shahi Paneer and Breads. They serve Onion , Chutney, papd and pickle complimentary with the food. Shahi paneer and Dal makhani were delicious. Specially I love the Dal Makhani. It was creamy and full of flavour. I will visit again this place for their Dal Makhani. With this we have Sprite which was serve chilled.We love this place, looking forward to visit again."
77,"Evening time is the time to hangout with friend to a cool place. Mostly after work we hangout in Connaught Place. This time our party place was Q'BA. Decor was great and cool. We impressed with it's interior and service. Connaught Place is a hub for the all types of Restaurants but this is different from others in terms of food quality and service.

Fish nuggets and Honey...read more"
78,We had a bitter experience here.Once we sat on our table for 20 mins not even one waiter came to gave menu or asked for anything. They need to improve when it comes to taking care of customers .. atleast in my case it was pretty bad.Even while you have food ..they don't come to refill water or care to ask .I opted this place based on reviews but it was disappointing for me.forget about when they came to give bill ..lol
79,"I recently been at this Place as I heard a lot about this Place.The Ambiance of this Place is soo Cool and Decor is soo Preety.Services here are soo Good as we get our Every order served on time.I tried their Chimi Changa, Malai Soya Chaap and Bhatti ka Murg.Everything was soo Delicious.Overall I had an Amazing Experience here :)"
80,"Simply wonderful ! (Table reservation recommended)Impeccable spacious restaurant with mannered staff, amazing atmosphere, plush seating, delicious food, and a nice Playlist.I tried - Vegetable Spring Rolls (nice but not that good), Cottage Cheese Burger (good patty with average fries), Alfredo Pasta (scrumptious, a must try), Ajwaini Paneer Tikka (delicious but green chutney provided was a bit spicy), and Cheese Frankie Rolls (2 units of delicious Rolls).In mocktails, both - Q'ba Fruit Bull and Watermelon & Mint Lemonade - was equally good (must try), Italian Smooch (good but not great), and both - Mango Twister and Green Dream - can be skipped without any regret!"
81,"I went here for a corporate celebration party with my colleagues and had the best time! The place is very grand. Huge space, big bar area and beautiful lights make up its ambience.The food and drinks were great too. Most of the night were gone in chattering and merryment, but I remember a few items that I really loved.Q'ba's Hyderabadi Biryani was really good. Aromatic and flavourful. Their Sarson Wali Fish Tikka was another highlight of our dinner there. The fish was cooked very well. Among the cocktails that I tried, the Negroni was made really well.Overall, I have to ask everyone to give this place a visit. "
82,"Q'BA located in the heart of Delhi, Connaught Place is one of the best place to enjoy with friends. We visited this outlet in a group of four and enjoyed alot. Their mocktail and cocktails were good and of reasonable price.They serve North Indian and Chinese food. We were in a mood of chinese food. We ordered Noodles, Manchurian and Fried rice.Noodles were little bit spicy. Fried rice tasted great with Manchurian. This is my favorite combination."
83,"An amazing new party place in CP. We went there in a group of 6 and had a pleasant experience.The crowd over there was good, also the staff was very courteous.The service was good too & they didn't take a lot of time in bringing the food to us.We tried the Crusty Garlic Toast, Dahi Kebab, Crusty Garlic Toast.The food was very tasty with good portions.

89,"After a really long time have I been so satisfied with a meal. The ambience and its vibe was soothing, the staff courteous and the food - a fresh, delicious delight. The ginger iced tea was perfect with a tinge of lemon and just the right amount of sugar. Blue Breeze was pretty refreshing as well. The Tandoori chicken pizza was probably one of the best pizzas I've ever had and the same goes for the tomato bruschetta - a lovely amalgamation of fresh tomatoes, olives, mozzarella with a hint of basil. This place is quite a delight and I would definitely recommend! "
90,We went on a Sunday lunch to the place.It has aquite demeanour to it.The food tasted good too.The drinks tasted well and the tandoori platter was good too

93,"Had lunch at one of the oldest and i think the biggest bar in CP. The place is massive and split in two levels, unlike a lot of bars and restaurants nearby it has a timeleess decor and a very classy ambience. The bar is long and impressive. The food and drinks were well made and worth returning for. The service was swift and courteous. I cant wait to re visit the place in the evening to experience the nightlife vibe at such a well made space. Highly recommend . "
94,This is place is quite good and their Thai Food was delicious and very well prepared. Service is quite good. Overall this is good to eat. I came at this restaurant first time and would definitely visit again.
95,"This place has a lovely ambience, there is no loud music to bother you. A calm place to chit chat over a couple of drinks and some good food."
96,"Had a wonderful time at Bercos-Q'BA!It was quite unexpected to find that Q'BA is now merged with Bercos. Anyway, we had a super sumptuous weekend meal with the Happy Hours throwing 1+1 free drinks!¬†Their must try - Juicy Chicken Drumstick (We loved it so much that at one point we thought of having that for the third time)¬†Golden Fish Finger was also good, although the Mayo dip was pretty bland! Their Shredded Lamb dish was superb. Chicken with Pepper was decent. Another must-try is their Chicken Dimsum.¬†Overall, it was superb.

97,"Q‚ÄôBA(use to be called Flying Saucer) Amazing place to have good food and drinks, beautiful ambience. Best place for one couple as the music is low where you can have a good conversation. If you are in a party mood, need loud music have a big group so avoid this place. But for a couple it‚Äôs perfect. "
98,This place is very nice Peacefull area good staffFood was so yummy as usualIts my 15 th(fifteenth ) visit Its located in connaught place i advice to visit here sure

100,"So last night I along with two other friends went to Q'ba /bercos and all in all it was a very sad experience. We used Zomato Gold 2+2 on drinks and ordered cocktails- an old fashioned and a mojito. The drinks were watered down, and the old fashion was terribly made. The air conditioning at the restaurant was barely working and considering how hot it was, eventyally we were sweating into our food and it was really uncomfortable. Also, the service was incredibly slow; As starters we ordered hara bhara cheesey kebab, chilly chicken dry and crispy honey lotus stem- the hara bhara cheesey kebabs were very dry and grainy, we saw no sign of any cheese and the kebabs all in all were quite bad....read more"
101,Awesome ambience quite spacious but I didn't liked the food. The chicken soup was quite good and delicious but their paneer dish was really pathetic. 
102,"So I went this place last weekend as I was just exploring some new cafes and I came across this one. And I must say, it was a good choice. Beautiful ambience, friendly staff, good drinks and amazing food üòãüòã. You should definitely visit this place once. "
103,An unplanned get together with colleagues and friends. When you decide to meet because of good weather. This place gave us a good spot to chill. Food was good and drinks were refreshing. We had yummy mac'n'cheese and loaded nachos. We had a great time. Just felt that it's too expensive.
104,"I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm very disappointed with the food. Momos were not even steamed properly, had some small stone in the noodles, pizza was also not baked properly. "
105,"Food was good...chicken chooza must try...however the restaurant refused to give 15%discount on total food bill on payment through Axis Bank card, inspite of showing that the offer is valid till 31oct 2019. Really disappointed by this."
106,"Visited this place with my family and the dining experience was really amazing. This place is so beautiful. The two most famous restaurants Bercos and Q‚Äôba are combined. This time we decided to make reservation at Q‚Äôba. It is newly opened and the taste, ambience, food quality is just amazing. The ambience is dark with dim lights and creates a peaceful atmosphere. We ordered Chilly Chicken, Veg Hakka Noodles, Golden Fried Prawns with hot garlic sauce, Old English Chicken Soup which has Chicken Corn, Mushroom and Creamed Stew, served with Garlic Baguette. We also had Vegetable Broth in which vegetables cooked in stock, pureed and finished with cream. The quality of all the dishes were...read more"
107,"Friend and I had dinner at Q‚ÄôBA; was visiting the place after a long gap of 10years. We ordered Loaded Nachos, Gardner Pizza and Grilled Chicken Steak and Brownie along with beer and whiskey. Well, all the food items tasted as they taste in any other similar restaurant, can‚Äôt make out the difference. So, food wise it was just ok, nothing to differentiate. However, portion sizes were big and I couldn‚Äôt finish my chicken.What was different was the space and seating; the place isn‚Äôt cluttered with furniture to maximise seating capacity. It gives you a sense of space, air to breathe and you don‚Äôt get to hear what people on the next table are talking. Staff was courteous and...read more"
108,"Ambiance is really awesome, bit expensive but worth it. Food is good and service is bit slow in comparison to other restaurant.I can rate 4 out of 5 for this restaurant."
109,"Spoiled food was served. The veg platter was a disaster. The virgin mojito tasted bad. The service and the ambience was good. But the main thing, food was bad and expensive."
110,It was a rainy winter night in Delhi in January and I was alone. But to eat a good meal is always that warms me up. I was strolling down the lanes and come across Q BA which was on my go to list since a long time. So alone I went and ordered.1. What a wonderful ambience they have. Dark wood interiors with muted lighting and an amazing center piece chandelier. Just the way I like it.2. I ordered fried momos for starters Veg Thai curry with rice and crispy spinach leaves. and ended with a chocolate mousse for dessert. Hell Yeah it was food full on. For the drink I had whiskey sour and the drink definitely had whiskey. The food was delicious and the crispy spinach leaves was suggested...read more

117,"Loved the restaurant, food was delicious, quantity was filling and ambience was decent. Comfortable arrangements for small to big gathering. Tables have ample amount of space which gives you a sense of privacy. Music was light and soothing in the day time although it appears the place may become a little loud in the evenings. Overall experience was amazing."
118,North Indian food is not that great. Has a great ambience though but for good food better visit simply bercos. Just a normal resturant but too much overrated.
119,"Q'BA one of those restraunt which never disappointed me. I came here many times because of their food quality, ambience and environment. 4 star from my side."
120,"Ambience is nice . But the taste of food is average or you can say normal and the food is not instaworthy . I had pao bhaji here . It was nice . They were out of fruit juices , they only had watermelon juice so I ordered that plus I have tandoori potatoes , I forget the real name of the dish . It was average. "
121,Professional place to be. Classy and luxury bar with neat ambience and polite staff. Platters are good. Sitting arrangement is nice. Can visit for a afternoon beer and snack 
122,Had a nice time. Ordered chicken tikka and paneer tikka which was quite delicious and had a really nice cocktail which was the bartender‚Äôs special. Overall nice experience for a candlelight dinner even though I went with a friend. Haha 
123,"Staff of the restaurant is very generous, I really like the place, perfect for family gathering, food is also mouth watering , menu is also nice , i have been here multiple times n have tried almost every cuisine , worth trying üëçüèª"

126,"A nice place to hangout with friends. Been there a couple of times and have always found the ambience with right mix of music and decorum.This time during my Delhi visit during navratris, got to explore the taste of healthy change Chaat which was served in a popadum. Tasted very nice.Virgin Mojito could be little better and the service guy though tried his level best but got confused with out order a few times. Nevertheless, a good place to chill."
127,"Lovely ambience and great food...courteous service as well..just one hiccup was when the waiter didn‚Äôt acknowledge our dineout coupon and the discount didn‚Äôt happen in the bill,he refused to admit that we had shown him the dineout coupon..but the manager gave a prompt reaction to it which was appreciated.."
128,"We went there on a Friday night ..lovely ambience , commendable hospitality both chicken drumsticks and crispy vegetables were authentic and delicious.. dry veg manchurian was decent and death by chocolate is a must try .. All in all a very good place for both family gatherings and office parties and not to forget also if u r on a date.. special mention of the waiters.. they would go out if the way to serve you .. awesome experience and worth the visit .. üòä"
129,"Only for couple, such a shitty idea!! People who actually generate revenue is not couples, you should do some math on it first. Make some arrangement for cover charge etc and maybe something else creativity managed. Get better managers.. :)"
130,"I have visited this place second time because of it's food quality, quantity and peaceful environment üôÇ This time I started with one of my favorite veg mezze platter and all stuff was good in the platter except pita bread. Pita breads were so hard to eat so I replaced it but second time was almost same ‚òπÔ∏è then we order nachos and it was served with yummy salsa sauce... Serving portion was really good. Also, had Veg Dum biryani and this is average in taste.Services are good and courteous staffüôÇ "
131,"We went to qba the other night , it was perfect at its ambience. The best part is Bercos is also adjoining and you can order from Bercos as well sitting in QBA.The most satisfying thing was chilli garlic fish üêü, trust me I have never had such delicious chilli garlic fish till date , chicken tandoori tangdi was moderate.Loved the accompanied salsa sauceTaste - 4.5Ambience-5Overall experience - 5üòçüòçüòçüòçüòéüòãüòãüòãüòãüòã"

133,Just loved the decor and Food is truly mouthwatering .... very good hospitality.. not too loud music.. you can come with family‚Äô also... will.definately coming back.
134,"QBA and Berco's merged together to end up completely gorgeous and amazing place. The Chinese is great and is served specially from Berco's menu whereas the Indian and Italian would be served from QBA. The lasagne was a bit dry, the roasted chicken pizza was quite nice. Loved the ambience. Looking forward to visit here again! "
135,"This is one place which never disappoints me.Food, ambience or service , everything is worth it.Prompt service and tasty food makes this place a value for money restaurant."
136,"I‚Äôve always loved this place. In fact, my fav in CP. No loud music, good options for drinks (though they have very less options for wines esp Red) and nice food (some snacks were a bit spicy). Service is pretty decent. I‚Äôd suggest trying this place if you‚Äôre trying to meet a prospective partner for the first time!"
137,It‚Äôs a good restaurant in middle of CP where nowadays you will only find pubs with loud music. Will like to visit again for the calm ambience and food also decent
138,"Recently been there. Loved the ambience, food and music. Service was also good . Really nice place to spend time with friends and loved ones. Recommended."
139,Such an amazing place to go out for a couple of drinks and some mouth watering foodNice place4.5/5 ambience3.5/5 food4/5 service4/5 deserts.Would. Love to visit this place again. 
140,"It is collaborated with Berco's..!!Ground floor mostly for lebanese and mughlai food. However, best is to sit on top for perfect ambience. You can try berco's chinese but I dont recommendit. If you hv good budget then go for main QBA cuisine. "
141,"Nice ambience, courteous staff though the food keeps switching from good to okay based on what you order. I have tried their pasta, falafel , salad , dimsums and mocktails .While everything else was just okay I really like their veg dimsums something which is quite rare to find. I can go there again just for the dimsums!"
142,Beautiful and classy ambience... been here many times‚Ä¶Fish fingers and pasta are awesome... kulfi was fab‚Ä¶¬†Interiors are gorgeous... so is the terrace area‚Ä¶.Must visit‚Ä¶
143,"They have managed to acquire a big place in a crowded places like CP, very well maintained though. The ambience and decor was super. Staff was super co-operative."
144,"pretty ambience. the food was really good. we ordered chilly garlic noodles, manchurian(gravy), chicken burger and chicken wings.¬† must recommend chilli garlic noodles, though mannchurian was not up to the mark. they have good music to sit there for hours, the staff is pretty good with their services. the place is not nice with the pocket though.overall the atmosphere was good must visit once :)"
145,Nice ambience and the staff is quite welcoming. Mocktails are not upto the mark but everything is perfect.A must visit place if you are in CP. 
146,A decent place with beautiful ambience...staff was courteous...love their creamy pesto amd chicken biryani..pasta was great in taste..thumbs up for that.. but chicken biryani was not upto the expectations..the chicken was little dry and was tasteless..in total the experience was good..
147,"Ambience was good, can still improvise on the FOOD. Chilly Paneer is supposed to be spicy, tandoori platter had Paneer which was not well marinated and lacked flavours. Overall experience was fine. "
148,"I am visiting this place since 2005. This place is my weakness.. i love its Ambience, Staff Friendliness and Specially the Evening in Outside Area.."
149,"Nice and quiet with a choice of menu between Q‚ÄôBA and Bercos. One of the few places where you can get draught beer, though only one brand.The fish with lemon craper sauce was excellent, grilled chicken wings were dish of the day, but found it to be average. Service was pretty good and people courteous, welcoming and warm.Overall a good experience!"
150,"This place has a decent ambience with great service. They have merged with Bercos which is a great idea indeed. I tried Pizza, Manchurian and fried rice. Taste was good. Not so pocket friendly I must say otherwise it's a good option for Weekend hangouts and Dinner."
151,I went here with a friend of my mine and we had a great time. Food was delicious and staff was courteous and friendly but the service is quite slow.
152,Beautiful cafe.... classy ambience...I tried so many dishesAll were fab specially Italian food and coffee...guys terrace area s awesome... üçï was fab.. good staff... decent crowd..must visit
153,"It was a sunday dinner night , Quite peaceful and nice ambience . Even the food tastes great . Had good time. One must go with the chinese its really good. "
154,When in Connaught Place and specially on weekdays than no need to think. This place is simply amazing with the awesome ambience.Light music üéß great staff and good space definitely make you feel good to relax to overcome all  your hectic busy day work. Enjoying this awesome place with your best buddies and spend some good time. If you are a good Chinese food lover than also this place is nice to go and try there best dishes.

155,"We chosen this place for dinner after great reviews written but to our surprise we had one of the worst experience with the quality and taste of food here. Although this place is having a great ambience and very friendly staffs but food is absolutely not up to the mark.Starters- Dahi Kebab- It was undercooked and was no way tasted like a Dahi Kebab, Completely tasteless.- Tandoori Chooza- It was absolutely not a chooza rather a healthy chicken. A complete layer of uncooked spices was rolled over the chicken and it tasted very tangy.Drinks- Out of hundreds of drinks listed in menu only few were available and after all we had to compromise with something we didn‚Äôt have a great...read more"
156,"We went there after going through their good reviews , however experience was a complete disappointment. Taste of food was very average and below expectation. We tried dahi ke kabab, paneer lababdar , kadahi chicken and all of them were very average. No complementry onion, pickle was served. No fingre bowl was served. This was our first and last visit to this place. Looking at the low occupancy of the restaurant on sunday evening , we realised that all the reviews on internet were probably paid reviews. "
157,I went here with my family on Sunday and staff is very decent and food was mouth watering and delicious. We enjoyed there so much and we must come again here 
158,"Cozy ambience, dim light, perfect table arrangement!! Food and food portion are really good. Satiate your hunger. I would givr 5/5 to service."
159,"Absolutely loved the place. Q'BA has long maintained it's name and standards in CP.I had their chana chaat for starters as we were looking for something low on calories. They had elevated a dish as simple as chana chaat beautifully.And later, we forgot about the calories and had their bercos menu - mix meat noodles and chicken in black pepper sauce.!Bercos food in QBA! Couldn't ask for more on a Christmas eve.Oh and they have Zomato gold, so alcohol is easy on the pocket! The staff was very cooperative when my Internet was acting weird. Overall, very courteous, polite and systematic.Great experience! Will go again! "
160,This place has one of the best ambience and soothing music. Service is fast and food quality is also very good. You have a rich experience and place is pretty affordable too. Good news Berco‚Äôs is also part of QBA now. Cheers
161,One of best destination in upscale area like cp...Love the ambiaance and fine dining exprience....grilled cottage cheese steak are the best and so is the penne alfredo pasta..
162,My favourite Indo Chinese outlet Berco‚Äôs has taken over their kitchen. Now you get Chinese in Q‚Äôba. Very good ambience and service. I‚Äôm happy that owner took the decision of merging two restaurants

165,"Apparently they have merged with Berco's, which actually seems a good idea, as the Chinese flavors at their place increased very well.....Nice ambiance with good booze & now good Chinese & Thai cuisines....."
166,It was a party thrown by one of my cousins. We were so excited for the food. The ambience is great just try getting on The 2nd floor of the property. We tried many different dishes and most of them were amazing.1.Paneer Tikka .......4/52.Dahi kabab.........3/5 (it was a bit sweet so that turned out to be a spoiler)3.Wontons.........3.5/5. (They were kind of stuffed samosa4.Dimsums......2/55noodles and vegetables in a Chinese currently.........5/56.Pizzas.....3/5The Base was a bit hardWe ended up getting a bill of 6000 for 10 people which was pretty decent.
167,"I visited QBA long time back. It is a good restaurant with buffet options for lunch. Ambiance is pretty but very professional-ish. A lot of meetings do happen here. Food is good, nothing extraordinary. Nothing bad. "
168,"Secret to the QBA Hyderabadi biryani: two handfuls rice, 1 piece of lamb and a bone! So much for fine dining. Floor Manager at upper floor, Mr. Rawat, bluntly stated, ""that's our standard serving"". We were also served water in dusty glasses. The restaurant manager later redressed our complaint, but the overall insensitivity left a bad taste."
169,"I went to this place with my friend for light dinner. We ordered Chicken dimsums and Bhatti ka murg. Bhatti ka murg was very spicy and heavy but it was quite good if I had been hungry. Dimsums were light and stuffing was really good. We ordered Kingfisher Ultra and Dark rum (Old Monk) as it was Gold restaurant.¬†Overall, experience was good as volume was low and music was nice. Staff was attentive and courteous.¬†Total Bill including Service Charge : Rs. 1236 Visit-2¬†Ordered Cosmopolitan, Original Veg Dimsum and Cheese & Corn rolls. All items were good as usual.Total Bill including Service Charge : Rs. 2482"
170,"Q‚ÄôBA has introduced a new concept of two brands under one roof wherein they have collaborated with Bercos and offer whole of their menu along with their usual menu. They have huge seating space and the ambience of this place, especially in the evenings, make it perfect to woo your date."
171,"It's more of a fine dining restaurant. The food quality is excellent. We ordered chicken Caesar Salad and Italian smooch. Both were 5/5. A big thumbs up to Italian smooch. It was way better than expected. I would recommend this drink to everyone. It's awesome, do give it a try.The ambience is 5/5. The services were excellent.Also, for alcohol you need a valid ID proof that says you're 25 years old. Sed.üòÇ"
172,"Q'BA a good place for the night, you will enjoy this place is you really want the feel of luxury or if you have a large group of friends or family and looking for a big place where no other will bump-in you. so i will suggest this is the place, as they have a feel towards the luxury so be prepared on the portion of the food as well. over all the food and the presentation is really good."
173,"Staff here was very friendly.Food was great,freshly cooked and well presented.Ambience was also great perfect for parties and family gathering. Every type of mocktail is available here."

175,"The ambience of Q‚ÄôBA is pretty good for a placid evening meal or a dinner. The presentation of the food is what I would like to give a five star. Now coming to the quality of the food, I would say that they ‚Äúserve what you order‚Äù. Even if you are in the middle of your meal and you don‚Äôt like a particular flavour, they are quick and ready to change it to ensure your best dining experience. Their corn cheese kebab are a must try as the savoury melts as soon as it enters your mouth. The only thing I don‚Äôt like about their food is the greasiness due to excessive butter especially in non-veg food items. Else, Q‚ÄôBA can be your perfect date go-to...read more"
176,Love the ambiance and the fine dining experience. The indoors is perfect for a nice date. Spring Rolls here are the best and so is the Chilly Garlic Noodles and Fruit Beer. Bercos is a part of QBA now so the prices are very reasonable. 
177,One of best destination in upscale area like cp it gives a good option of fine dining and classical ambience. I went there for first time and enjoyed everything. Food is OK but need to be more fresh as i ordered lamb which lack freshness. Service is good. 
178,"Q‚ÄôBA used to be one of the most upmarket and legendary places in CP until they decided to convert it into The Flying Saucer Cafe. But we were pleasantly surprised when they again planned to restore their name and the place. More than anything, we again had a chance to relive our memories at this place and we didn‚Äôt want to miss this chance this time around. And this time they have introduced a new concept of two brands under one roof wherein they have collaborated with Bercos and offer whole of their menu along with their usual menu. Who would mind such an option? More options, better it is.¬†‚Äã"
179,"Visited this place a few days ago and the ambience was one thing which attracted me alot. It's a fine dining cafe with dance floor and ample seating space. The cafe was really hygienic. Service was a bit slow. Food was really amazing in both taste and quality. Also, portion size was great!We had there, wonton soup, pan fried vegetables noodle and vegetables dimsums. Everything was fresh and tasted good. "

182,"An excellent place for a dinner with family. Took my parents for a dinner to celebrate their wedding anniversary. Was worried that this too might turn out to be a dimly lit bar, but was pleasantly surprised with the ambiance.The plus side now is that you get food from both Berco's as well as Q'BA in the same place.Food was good, so was the service.Slightly on the expensive side, but the overall look & feel of the place makes up for the money you shell out, for a good evening with the family."
183,"It's a great place to relax and chill out with family or friends. That's the thing I liked the most about Q'BA.I visited it with friends, and we ordered:..For Food- Banjara murg tikka, Hyderabadi mutton biryani and chilli garlic chicken noodles. (All three tasted average)...For Drinks (mocktails)- Red Ocean and Italian Smooch (mocktails were good)...One thing which will be calling me back to this place is it's perfect ambience."
184,"I have visited this place few days ago with my whole family. And we were totally amazed by the ambiance of this place. It is very amazing, and the service of this Restaurant is excellent.We had had the Chicken Drumsticks as Starters followed by Spring Rolls and Classic Mojito.After that we ordered the Chicken Noodles and Spicy Chicken Curry and Chicken Manchurian.And the Taste of this was soo good , that we ordered another set of same.Ratings:Ambiance- 5/5Service- 4/5Food- 4/5Price- 3/5"
185,"It was a delight to have lunch at this place which gradually got extended to an evening coffee as well given the decor, ambiance and overall look and feel of the place. The dining area is so well spread out and well decored that you would naturally want to spend more time there. Special mention of Corn Cheeze Kabab, a very unique and new taste for us there. Will be back at this place soon."
186,"The ambience of the place is simply amazing. The seating arrangement was good with lot of space in between. The food at this place is also great. Tried Pizza, Pasta and Indian main course, the preparation for each was really fantastic. Loved the place."
187,A very good place to chill out with friends. It was an amazing experience. The ambience is very chilled out. The decor is luxurious. Services is very welcoming and friendly. The drinks were really good. Its on the pricey side and the food is good nothing extra ordinary tasting food. Everything is just perfect with nicely spaced out tables and a live bar counter. Perfect party place in Connaught Place.

193,"After visiting Q'BA last in 2011, I must say, they have improved by leaps and bounds, perhaps by collaborating with Berco's for giving customers with a premium experience at a relatively modest rate. Interested customers must try their tandoori prawns and Khao Suey. Bon appetit!"
194,Great Ambience with polite staff and amazing food. Tandoori platter is a must try from the starters. I ordered veg lasagne and it was rich and delicious filled with cottage cheese. 
195,"This place is among the best considering the valur for money perspective and the quality of food. This hotel chain is run by Mr. Atul Kapur, who is also a social worker in the same line. I would highly recommend this place to food lovers as I visit this place every week with friends and clients who appreciate the food and service. I have visited almost all 5 star hotels and their restaurants in Delhi and I can say that it is a good substitute to them if you are low on money."
196,"Q'BA¬†is an excellent place for a quiet sunday afternoon. The staff is very well trained and courteous, the food is great and the ambience is relaxing. We ordered mushroom soup, chicken platter and red sauce pasta which were all delicious."
197,"Went to Q'BA two weeks back with friends. This place was lit. My experience was so good at this place that I recommended few of my friends for birthday party.Fish tikka, Butter chicken and daal makhani was very good.

They were good. Service was fine. Time taken to serve the cocktails was OK. Snacks basket which i ordered had all fried snacks. The taste was just about OK. But, it seemed costly as more than half of it was fried potato wedges. Most of all i liked the ambience and the atmosphere. And, of course the light music in the background. Overall a good experience. Do try it. Recommended."

226,"I happened to come across this place while strolling around in Cp on saturday evening. The entrance of this place is a kind of cramped up on one side of the wall, and you might not even notice it if you happen to cross by this side of the E circle. However, on entering, the ambience was pretty chic and classy. It wasn't as crowded as one might find other places in cp to be. For starters and drinks we ordered chocolate and hazelnut shake which to me tasted like chocolate milk and had very less hazelnut flavouring; and a tex-mex basket which had potato wedges and cheese balls among other things. For the main course we ordered the classic subz veg biryani which was pretty good. To give an...read more"

233,"Went to qba for dinner and ordered one Pina colada and chocolate smoothie. They were nice. Then we ordered a nonveg basket which consists of fried prawns, fried chicken wings, cheese  nuggets and fish fingers. I have never tasted such shit food anywhere in my life. The fried prawns and fish fingers taste like my cat's gravy fish food smells. Yuk!! And cheese nuggets were far from being called that. They were some kind of rolls filled with god knows what. And lastly the fried chicken wings might belonged to a malnutrition hen!! I did not bother to order the main course."
234,"I don't wanna say much about this lounge as it just feels good when you are there. You will love the food, the ambience, the servers, the music...
