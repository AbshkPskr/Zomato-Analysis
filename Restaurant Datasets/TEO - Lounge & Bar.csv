He also had his keys collection area at the entrance of dining room..2...He parked it somewhere and received a chaalan for improper parking.3.. Who knows best than a valet and restaurant where to park.4. No help from management even refused to provide details of vallet.

17,"*Advisory if you are going through Zomato/Dineout Booking*: It is full of terms and conditions such as you can't have seafood, shots at a discount. If you are getting a 40% discount, you are getting 60% in quantity. Loud music was also the issue. The taste and service were okay, but not worth the price you pay. If you are thinking, you are saving money, well I am sorry, you aren't. Sarcastically, there are more banners of Zomato/Dineout TnC inside and outside the cafe than the brands themselves. I had good expectations from such a brand but was disappointed, don't fall into the temptation of positive reviews."
18,"I went there with my friends and it's really nicely place to visit in this pandemic . The TEO properly take care of precautions . I ordered butter Chicken , garlic naan and chicken biryani .
