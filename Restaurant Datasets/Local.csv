0,Its better not to keep a DJ than keeping this rubbish kind of music at new years eve. One would rather prefer it to be a silent place than taking a headache home.

2,"Okay...so it's a huge place with a darker, warehouse-like decor...the staff are nic and courteouse... The food is just average. I did like the nachos. But the pasta and the drinks were just average. Also, the brownie was tooooo sweet and the ice cream scoop with it tasted like a cheap one...and that was very disappointing when they charge you like 400bucks for that. But the thing I disliked is the fact that despite marking every alternate table with a cross in order to maintain social distancing, the staff were making customers sit there...and they weren't really bothered even if the next table (within 3-4feet distance) was occupied. This shows that they are only concerned about business...read more"
3,"Amazing place to Hogg, chill and hangout with your friends or colleagues. Food is decent and serves good portions which can easily be shared amongst 3-4 people."
4,"I was here with a friend for dinner and we had a really good experience. We started with Hakka noodles, which were delicious and the portion size was good too. And then we had pan fried dim sums, they were stuffed with a very juicy vegetable filling and tasted delicious with chilli sauce. We also tried their pav Bhaji, it was a little spicy which made it my personal favourite over there. The pav  were soft and buttery. We ended the meal with choco lava cake, loved it‚Äôs presentation as well. We also had an Aam Panna and red sangria. The staff was efficient in their work. Plus, the music was sooo good!"
5,The food is not at all good and very overpriced. The tandoor platter was served cold and its just reheated in microwave. Not at all recommended. And the serving to price ratio is horrible.
6,"I went here yesterday for lunch. The staff took every precautionary measure and the service there was good. Ambience here is beautiful.I hadRed wine sangria was very good and i liked it alot.Makhan wali pav bhaji was so buttery and well seasoned served with onions, lemon wedge and green chutney. It was amazing.Crystal vegetables pan fried dumping was delicious. They were well seasoned and well stuffed, soft yet crisp at the bottom with all the sauces.Choco lava cake was so good. It was moist and filled with chocolate and served along with caramel popcorn, ice cream with chocolate sauce and fruits. It complimented the dessert so well i loved it.I loved my experience here and...read more"
7,Nice ambience Nd soft music to talk each other Great service by lalitDefinitely come again at local 
8,Bullet chilli chicken is good Crispy corn is awesome Nd great service by lalit Singh rana who provide us great choice in food 
9,ill trained and rude staff. Main course comes before appetizers. At reception mr lalit promptly called the valet and took the keys however while returning he demanded rs 100 and when I told him I have never paid for a valet the highly mannered staff (lalit) said har jagah lagta hain..aap kahi gaye nahin hoge....so local like the name is local who are filled with cheats and ill mannered and incompetent staff. Plse avoid at all cost..
10,"This place is a total waste of money. We ordered 3 items - chicken tikka, ajwaini fish and penne arabiatta alongwith a beer, cosmos and a mocktail. Except for cosmos..everything was below average (except beer which thankfully they couldn't ruin). Pasta had a lot of salt, the fish was way too spongy, we ended up not eating it. Chicken was ok. The portion size was so small, I mean the moment we saw the pasta..we knew we would be ordering more, but thanks to the taste we didn't. The total bill came out to be more than Rs. 3500 (not at all worthy). We ended up giving the feedback to one of the servers. The one who was serving us was coming onto our face and we would recommend the bar manager...read more"
11,"Me and my cousin went to local for some me time and I would love to say that local is an amazing place for good food and good music. We had pasta, chilli chicken and drinks. The music was great and we had a lovely time there. Had Such an amazing experience. Totally love it."
12,The staff behaviour could have been better.Never take recommendatiom from staff bcz they always tell the priciest option with minimum portion.Also i have visited the place 2 times and both time they have added items to my bill that i have not ordered. Many ppl after drinking dont care to see the bill properly. Not a good experience both times.
13,Place is good but I really felt like staff behaviour can be improved. Food quality is amazing and so is ambience. Stag entry not allowed. Good place to pick in CP
14,"I loved the ambience. That's it. Rest, the food is too overpriced. And according to that the taste did not meet my expectations. "
15,Local is quite a spacious place and an amazing in house music. The seating is quite comfortable and the staff was friendly too.We would definetly recommned this place to try atleast once. We ordered Chilly Paneer Cigar Rolls and Loaded Cheese Nachos.Both of thek were really scrumptious.
16,Nice food nice ambience good portion size 
17,The pizza & mocktails were good. The ambience is also really pleasant. Recommend this place for groups. 
18,"Food: Have ordered Farmveggie pizza, honey chilly potato, spring rolls, asli aam shake, cold coffee and junnon sherbatBest: Pizza and Chilly potatoAmbience: amazing place to spend great time with friends, very spaciousLocation: prime locationVfm:4/5Planning to visit again: Surely :)"
19,Amazing food with the soothing music makes you enjoy the time being there with your closed ones.One must visit this place being in a connaught place 
20,"While the food wasn't bad, the ambience of the place fell a lil flat. I'd recommend nachos and Afghani chicken tikka. On the up side, the place maintains stringent socially distancing and is a decent place for a casual hangout with friends"
21,"If you are looking for a place with spacious sitting area to dine in this place is your ultimate destination. When I entered the cafe I couldn't take my eyes off the interiors and the happening vibes of this place. I visited this place with my friend and we decided to sit balcony area to have a wider and beautiful view from the top. When it came to placing the order we really had to wait a lot as no staff was paying heed to us. Also we got our orded quite late.Apart from this, the foo was worth trying for sure 1. My friend order some peri peri chicken nuggets which was from their non veg menu. - presentation wise it looked lovely 4/5, when it comes to the taste I can't really...read more"
22,"Last night we went at Local to attend the Halloween bash party. It was very decent and good experience, specially the service quality was good during the event and staff was very courteous. Their super terrace was very amazing me and my frnds really enjoyed a lot after 7months . Thanks team keep it up. Well done. "
23,Very poor quality of dessert served. Apparently menu ofwas changed although with similar name and price.....not worth it..... disappointed
24,Tried their veg platter and tandoori chicken . Veg platter was good .It had 2 pieces each of : Veg kabab -3/5 Dahi k shole -3/5 Soya chaap stuffed -4/5 Panner tikka- 4/5 Walnut seekh kabab -2/5Chiken tikka - 3/4 Service -5/5 Staff-5/5Sanitization-5/5 Service is good as usual .

25,Its good place to celebrate any occasion as I celebrate my birthday there with my friends i enjoy alot love the food and good service. 
26,"Nice restaurant. Good place to hang out with friends and family.  ordered dal makhani, butter tandoori roti. Dal makhani was so creamy and buttery. Tandoori roti was well cooked. Ambiance is amazing. Place is quite spacious.  the quantity of food was ok. But the lighting could be more. "
27,"One of the best restobar in Cp, Delhi. Head this place for good food , drinks and grooving music .Recommend!!"

32,The ambience of this place is really nice.I really liked the fried rice here.A good place in delhi
33,Amazing.place to visit with great food especially mac and cheese pasta is amazing.do try it....but bit expensive...
34,Local is amazing and Is not so local . The ambience and decor is amazing. Its a high end place also amazing for a good lunch or dinner date. The presentation of food is amazing. I find the lighting little dim but at the end its more active at night. Good place though it is expensive than normal . But once in a while a good high end place feels amazing. Fish and chips are must must try . Quantity taste and quality is awesome. Though I ordered chicken 65 and I didn't like the kick of it but maybe someone would like it . You can try but there are also other options. We also did hukkah there. And was not reasonable but at last its all about high end places. Too fancy but worth too. 
35,The ambience was okayish ...the maintenance of the sofas were not up to the mark... Food was good....pizza was thin crust and was 3/5..Cheese chilli toast-3.5/5Calcutta chowmein- 3/5Popcorn coffee-4/5Peanut butter coffee-3.5/5...Overall the experience was good..
36,"wandertastesaloni : Frankly speaking there is nothing so special in local cp. Also I have seen a lot of pubs where the manager stare first and them smile to girls. Its so weird. But not of all the pubs. So talking about this pub ,crowd was good , but its a small pub and I dont like the dj mix music. Otherwise the environment was good."
37,"Local offers really great food. The ambience is just perfect. Interior designing is mesmerizing. The service is also very good. You can have a great time here with your friends. They offer huge variety of foods and drinks. However, it's quite expensive but worth it. You'd love to spend your time and money here"
38,I have been there with my friend the place is amazing but food was not up to the mark. I was ordered Chicken Makhni cream pizza but couldn't find any Chicken on it and veg pizza was fine. I think after covid    we didn't get any free table on main area and they provide us table on there private area. So totally experience was not good but ambiance  was quite nice.
39,The best you can get. For an amazing evening experience hop into this place. The place is big enough to show some dance moves too....

44,I went for a treat on my friend‚Äôs birthday and I literally enjoyed the ambiance and the vibes.Undoubtedly a fancy crowd was there with a great space ofcourse. Because In a place like Delhi where there is a shortage of space in most of the cafes the bar having a good space definitely provides you the best experience though. Plan a party or a big gathering this place would be one of the good options for you ‚ù£Ô∏è
45,"Worst every food I tried , Don't know this was because of lockdown or what but paneer butter masala daal makhani was too bad and smelly even paneer taste was like expired paneer totally disgusting."
46,"Visited this place first time on a Wednesday evening with my wife at 8 PM. To my surprise only 1 table was occupied in the entire restaurant. Although the ambience was good. Sanitised at the gate, temperature was taken but waiters were not wearing gloves. Ordered honey chilli potatoes for starters. Even after being ""honey"" chilli potatoes, they were heavily spicy. Then ordered Chinese platter having noodles, paneer curry & spring rolls. They were pretty decent. The service was good , as there was no other customers out there. My overall rating is as follows, Food:4/5, Service:4/5, Ambience : 4.5/5 , Sanitisation 3/5. Total 4/5. This is a must visit place."
47,The ambiance is pretty nice. Its a perfect place for parties and hangout with your friends. Also the taste of the food is quite nice and its a perfect place for alcohol also

Filling was flavourless and didn't go well with Chutney.Pav Bhaji:- Presented well like a local kulcha Wala thela. Tasted Good.Pyaaz ki Kachori with Chole ki Sabzi:- Pyaaz filling was flavourful. It could have been more crispy. Also I found no relation between kachori and Sabzi. It can be served alone also."

Although quite empty owing to it being a Monday afternoon but the ambience was extremely beautiful and they had such lively music! Moreover the food was extremely delicious! I had their Mushroom and Spinach Momos followed by Makhanwali Pav Bhaji which was absolutely yum! So creamy and unlike any I have tasted in all of Delhi. Next I had their European Platter which was quite good but I wish there was more gravy on top of the chicken breast. Lastly I had their Cheese Nachos which absolutely blew my mind! Truly amazing food. I would like to visit Local once again on a weekend but this too was a memorable...read more

179,"I entered the place thinking how luxurious it will be from inside after checking Local from outside look, well I was not disappointed. The time you will step in, you will be pleasantly surprised with loud music and huge TV screens adding to the spirit. If you want a quiet corner, take the staircase and find a suitable seat. And if you want to be around crowds, sit at the ground floor. The hall is heightened and magnificent. It was total classy and opulent.Cuisines:Mexican, Indian, European, Asian, Street Food, Bar, MediterraneanThe food reflects local dishes of various regionsand prices are reasonable.* ‚ÄòChakhna Platter‚Äô : It was filled with Popcorn, masala peanuts, channa jor...read more"

191,The food and ambience at local cafe was really good.The popcorn coffee was very tasty and new for me.The pasta was very different and tasty.
192,"In comparison to the other lounges in Connaught Place, this place is really spacious, has a big screen inside and I loved the music that the DJ was playing on Thursday night.We ordered vegetarian masala Manchurian, golgappa, cheese nachos and a couple of cocktails and mocktails. I loved your presentation of food everything was presented in a unique style which was really appreciable.¬†While nachos were average but Manchurian and golgappa were good. I simply loved the Patiala Cocktail served in dry ice and a bottle and we ordered it twice.¬†We also tried a milk based cocktail which was average. They offer quite a different variety of cocktails which you don't really get in many...read more"

197,Service was excellent and food was great. Mr. Ranvir was excellent with his prompt service! Would love to visit again
198,"It was an okay experience to begin with which later turned into a disappointment. We were still finishing food at a regular human pace and the staff kept bugging, despite having asked for just 5 more minutes.Moreover on our way out, someone from the staff asked to move faster when there are still other people/groups inside.If that's how they behave with their customers. Duly Noted!!"
199,We loved the food and the ambience. The service was quick. Food portions were sufficent and tasty. Our server dhanveer was very polite and courteous. We had a great experience.

210,"Never ever go to this place. This place provides you shitty food and makes you wait for it for a hell lot of time. I hate this place, and would suggest everyone to not waste you time and money here."
211,Best place to celebrate birthdays or anything with your friends. The ambiance is best.The eating area is huge. They serve all the local food of every state and those too famous ones. Their food is just amazing. They have many options on their menu cards. Though the mocktail is section was not that impressive but whatever they had was the best which I had in my life. I really loved it.
212,"My fav lounge till now n food was mouth watering ,ambience was sooo good and crowd was very decent"
213,"We went there at around 7:30pm. Portion size of chilli honey potato was just not enough as compared to other bars/lounges in CP.MARTINI tasted strong but was not impacting which means low quality Liquor was used to prepare it.same goes with LIIT.Shesha was overpriced (1399+tax)Waited for DJ til 9:30pm, he was playing romantic English songs.We felt that they were intentionally not playing a good DJ. I would not recommend it to anyone!!"
214,Great food and great service by dev
215,Nice place. Service by deb.
216,"he restaurant was pretty amazing , there's an indoor as well as outdoor seating. If you wish to have an outdoor seating then my suggestion would be to come as early as possible because the place is usually crowded.Also that area is open for smoking and drinking.Talking about the food it was delicious."

Totally bland and lacked spices the only saviour was the green chutney! Thank god for that.We also tried Humus and Pita Bread Platter which was decent enough but again had a lot of scope of improvement.Talking about the ambiance its LIT AF and you'll have a good time if You just wanna chill out and dont wanna eat.Service was also bang on EXCEPT the manager was a little rude.

220,"I went to local at CP with my best friend and tried two mocktails- khatta pudina and peach and orange flavoured ice tea. Peach and orange flavoured ice tea was very good and flavourful. In starters we had tandoori veg platter which had hara bhara kabab, two types of paneer tikka and dahi ke kabab. Paneer tikkas and dahi ke kabab very good but the hara bhara kebab were a little spicy. Ambience was very good and pleasing."
221,"What you don‚Äôt love about this place might just go unanswered for a place like local. Located in the heart of Connaught Place, it is one of the finest place where you can dine out with your loved ones. The place is amongst the favourite for carrying out an office party. Yes, it‚Äôs that big. Great music, great food, amazing ambience is all what you need to make your Friday night amazing and this place guarantees it. Be there to feel it all."

234,"The food is really good but above that the staff is very polite, special thanks to Pradeep and Mithlesh for the free brownie and the apt service."
235,They do not have much options to order food. Limited snacks üêç
236,This place is quite over - hyped. Not much to offer in the shakes section. They only have two kinds of shakes i.e. Chocolate peanut butter and Kulfi shake while they have two variants of cold coffee I.e. Cold Coffee vanilla and Popcorn coffee.Tried their chicken tikka masala pizza and chilly chicken. Both the items were below average and dint please our taste buds. Cold coffee vanilla was just fine. 3/5 overall
237,The pasta was very tasty. You should definitely give it a try. We also tried lahsuni chicken. It was alright. Service was good and the ambiance was great. Shankar and Dharmendra gave impeccable service......
238,"I am a person who doesn't like shady places. It took us a while to find one matching my preference and it was LOCAL, Cp.I was skeptical at first owing to the name of the place but it obviously proved me wrong.I totally loved the ambience, it wasn't shady at all. The crowd was decent and so was the staff.The food was decent. I liked nachos the most and also the pizza.Overall it was a good experience!"

An amazing host and an amazing person. Local is amazing and we keep coming back again and again. We love the place and the amazing staff!
242,First visit to this place and it was amazing to make few more visits soon. The place comes alive after late work hours. And the variety of cocktails adds to the good time. Did not like pizza which we ordered. But still menu is vast and there are ample of things to try.
243,It is a lovely place with a good ambience and as we went on a Saturday afternoon so it was pretty empty but service was still slow.The food and drinks we ordered were absolutely delicious though I find it slightly on a pricey side.

259,"The ambience is undoubtedly great. The food is good as well, tried their non veg platter which was pretty decent. Also tried their baked nachos which weren‚Äôt upto expectations. In drinks we had their parsi cocktail and green park collins and these were quite good. They could‚Äôve worked a little more on their non veg snacks, otherwise the drinks were great. The chocolate fantasy that we tried in dessert was just okay-ish."

264,Taste and food not worth it as per the prices
265,"No doubt veg platter was delicious but it‚Äôs quantity comparative to the price was definitely quite less. If you are the one who doesn‚Äôt consume alcohol, do not miss the popcorn flavoured cold coffee, it‚Äôs something which tastes so unique and of course a brilliant concept ‚ô•Ô∏è Their pizzas are freshly made, that is one more thing I loved. The ambience of the place is magnificent.But the staff left me disheartened, they weren‚Äôt as responsive as they could be :("
266,Initially we were planning to go to some other place. However I am glad that we made this choice... Loved the food and place. Will recommend to everyone
267,Good food and good service by Shankar and Manwendar
268,A successful dinner is one that lasts a while and one where everyone leaves happy but that's not in the case of LOCAL. Suprisingly even situated at the most prominent location they hardly bother and care for their guests. Staff is promptly rude and mannerless specially the guy name komal. The ambience and food variety is fine but very ordinary.I'll suggest to look into other better options if you don't want to ruin your delightful evening.. nothing out of the box with high on your pocketbook to. I'll suggest management to keep an eye on their staff behaviour

Both were really good and staff was also polite . About the Place it is built in a huge space and has a very good ambience"
296,"Most food items are served in innovative ways which do strike a chord but they are priced very steeply. The presentation is wonderful, the ambience is breathtaking, the music is soothing, but the food tastes just above average, so the high prices don't seem too justified."

305,"Loved the ambience of the place. The food was amazing especially the southwestern chicken was a must have. Shoutout to the service of Naveen, he was very prompt in serving us and enriched our experience. Also, the place has ambient lighting for taking selfies. "
306,They don't have good playlist.. dj is like bull shit..and manager behavior is not so friendly.. -1 star
307,"The management and staff thinks that just because the customers have had a couple of drinks, people cannot tell the difference. The staff is quite rude and are not in sync. Went there for an important night and they somehow managed to ruin it in every way possible. CP has a lot of places to visit and i have personally visited almost all of them. Go to some other place. There are a lot of options"

309,Food :4Ambience :4Service (delivery) :4Order :Cheese nachosTandoori chickenVeg pizzaVeg noodlesWent their on a Saturday afternoon with friends. This place is huge with ample seating area.Ordered cheese nachos. The service was little slow but because of good ambience that was not a problem.The nachos were crispy and crunchy with adequate cheese. The quantity of tandoori chicken üêî was good. It was flavorful but not spicy.The pizza üçï was thin crust and cheesy and tasty.The only thing I didn't like was the noodles. It was little bland to my taste.The virgin mojito was also good.Overall a good place to spend time with your friends and have yummy üòã food.
310,I booked this place after i liked the ambience on zomato. The ambience was no doubt great. But the music was too loud. I had a headache after i came out. The fish tikka was tasteless. The chicken drumsticks weren‚Äôt covered with foil paper which was unhygienic. The non veg platter and pizza was good.A one time visit might be..
311,"Local really sucks. I am a reliant visitor here. I am standing her and it‚Äôs really bad. I am not gonna come here ever. If you order hooka- they say no, if you order something to eat they say- no. Bloody hell. The time for local  is up!!  Now they should shut it down !! "
312,I visited Local on my birthday.overall the experience was good bt as we were went there in the day tym the norml music was played.Food quality nd quantity was awesome.i feel that they have to included more items in there menu.Great Experienceüëç
313,"This place is fab, located in the heart of City. It's huge and wide.....you can easily accommodate yourself here in the weekends....each table has ample space to chill with their groups. Interior is marvelous. Though the bar menu is also designed in locals way and might not give you the clarity on drinks. But the attendants are nice they can help you finding the right platter and make your check in go easy"
314,"One of the best places to be in the Connaught Place area. With its amazing ambience and spacious area, you are sure to have a good time. White sauce pasta is dreamy here and LIIT's are totally lit. Everything on the menu is delish. Do visit this place once."
315,"The service is really good and the food has come really quickly. Good service and food for the cost were worth it. I would highly recommend this restaurant. The food is absolutely amazing in this restaurant, you have to try Tandoori non vegetable platter and Murgh malai Tikka etc. I had a nice time at the Local restaurant with my parents."

Food taste is 10/10.Ps. Camera is Samsung M30s."
325,It's a nice cosy place to hangout
326,I have visited local restaurants is very good places for party with friends 
327,Unprofessional service from Mr. Dev and Sam and especially these guys ask for rating and review. Which I believe is fake and not honest. I wish I could review below 1.
328,"Nice ambience and food, courtesy service. Name: Dev"
329,They bribe for rating. Don't go there.....not ambience nor the food quality specially pathetic service from Dev & Sam. If you won't give them good ratings they will threat you

We were served food by Samsad and he really recommended us good tasty food. Great service."
345,Went out for a dinner with my newly wedded friend and our school gang. It was a nice meet up and had lots of fun. Food was just outstanding. I totally loved there white sauce pasta it was not that cream which gives you a heavy feeling nor it was less cheesy so that balance was good. The loaded nachos had hell lot of cheddar cheese which was very different from other places. I was so underestimating the nachos but one must try. Chicken drums of heaven were another not only tasty but also had such amazing juicy texture. Chicken was tender soft and i totally enjoyed it. LITs i would recommend are the electric LIT which is blue in color and Cranberry LIT rest if you want to go without flavour...read more
346,"Went for a ladies night out for my friend's birthday. What i like is what i would recommend. The non platter is a steal deal which one must order because one can try all the samples of Tandoori item and if u like any then can order full portion. I loved fish tikka and mutton kebab. I even liked chakna platter which was again a best deal one should go for it as it has lots of variety to try. We were basically there to drink and eat less so we had LITs and i preferred Sangria. I loved White wine Sangria the most, event the CP smash cocktail with gin was smooth and refreshing. Nice music and amazing ambiance."
347,"Tried these schezwan chicken dimsums which were smll pockets of chicken dimsums, they were spicy and juicy. I will definitely recommend that and also the wine braised prawns where are umbo prawns and taste just brilliant. My friend tried prawns for the first time in her life and now she is so addicted to that taste that she went here again to have this. Wonderful LITs and amazing ambiance. Best place in CP."

350,Great food and amazing ambience. Great service. LALIT
351,Welcome to a place that serves food synchronous to its name Local. We ordered a pizza that tasted like ot was a frozen pizza heated in microwave. The mojitos tasted okay. The honey chilli potatoes were hard and were reheated and served. With the price tag they have put its quite expensive for stale food

369,specially Lalit and Naveen's service. These guys did all they could to make us feel comfortable and enjoy the evening after the day.

I basically like this place just because of classy and very well maintained Ambience, Food served here is pretty good and¬†I am fan of their spring rolls that is properly crispy and full of veggies, not much like their white sauce, Rates are quite reasonable, fascinated by their Ambience, a great place to enjoy with ur friends and colleagues for sure, Highly Recommended place by¬† my side"

381,Went to this place many time but my favourite is the white sauce paste and tandoori chaap these are my two favourite dishes .they are so well cooked and the ingredients are so well measured and perfect .they are mouth watering. The ambience is perfect to hangout and chill with friends. 
382,"I went to this place with my colleagues and it was a horrible experience. Even though we had pre-booked our food and beverages package we were served our drinks after 1/2 hour and starters were served after 45 minutes. The DJ was playing only hip hops songs and when we requested the manager to play few Bollywood songs, he was extremely rude and said that playing Bollywood songs was against their policy. We spoke to another manager and he was equally rude. Even though we spent a handsome amount of money there, none of us could enjoy.WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE IF YOU WANT TO ENJOY. Ideal place for just sitting, eating and chit-chatting."

Definitely recommend this place.I ordered aam Panna which tasted divine and lemonade.In starters I order chicken 65 - found them best among the starters was served with a dip, BBQ chicken - it was fried in chilli sauce, tasted divine and Amritsari fish - it had a taste of cheese fried inside fish.Main course - ordered chicken which was served with laccha parantha.

411,"This review is being written out of the greed for free brownie and ice cream but it is definitely going to be worth the read! The ambience is one where you can just let yourself go, sinking into the groove of the music and the clinks of the glasses. The food is served as per your personal preferences and customization along with a warm staff reception. Had aglio olio with cold coffee, definitely worth a try. Was served very warmly by Navin and Sanjay!"

Ordered forFish and chips ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êCocktail chicken pizza ‚≠ê‚≠êThe pizza base was thin crust and extremely hard. It was not edible after 5-10 mins. It wasn't even loaded with a lot of topping and stuff. I didn't like it at all which is ironical because this place is reviewed for good pizzas. On the contrary, the fish and chips were amazing. One of the best I have ever had."

429,"I was here last night with my 6 friends and the bill was nearly 12 k for 7 of us. We ordered many dishes along with Drums of Heaven and to my surprise I don't know what size wings or drumettes they have used, you can see the pictures. The dish was named as ""Heavy Drums of Heaven"" and you can see how heavy it was üòÉ.The place is good but the food quantity is below average.My reason of giving 1 rating is because I reported the issue with the dish to the attendant not waiter, a lady from north east, to which she replied ""Sir hamare yahan aisa hi banta hai"" I was shocked with her reply.Thanks, I will think twice before going again to this place. "
430,Local is very good place with cosy atmosphere.. chicken dishes were heavenly my favourite is chicken tikka.. I had great time here.. 
431,"It‚Äôs a great place for a hangout, evening time they do offer a place to dance n chill. Food quantity not so appealing, rest it was all sane!"
432,"So I was visiting delhi after long from New York and wanted to go to some fairly new bars. I stumbled upon this place, good rating, nice ambiance, nice place to hangout with friends on a friday night. So out of ALL places in Connaught place i choose this, I get there and the front desk lady just had one question to ask - ""stags or couple"", I was like 3 boys 1 girl. She immediately turns her mood upside down and be like ""stags not allowed"". I did not want to argue on that so I politely ask - ""is the place packed or so"", she goes ""not really"". We just turn away and go to another bar (which there is no problem finding in CP) and had a good time. But again that made me wonder WHY would a...read more"

437,"Local is one of the best place in Connaught Place, recently I tried this outlet which was just amazing and the ambience was lovely. Interior were too good and seating was too comfortable.We had:-Chilly Chicken:- Chilly Chicken were too tempting and I just love the quality of chicken. Must tryChicken Dim Sum:- Chicken Dim Sum were so delicious and tasty, full of flavour of butter chicken and full of spices.Non-Veg Platter:- Platter were perfectly cooked, it was full of flavour and full of spices. I just loved the Quality of chickenOreo Shake:- Shake were too chocolaty and so thick. Must tryOverall had a really good time would definitely recommended this place."
438,Beware of the waiters there ...they ask for returning the customer copy of the bill after the bill is paid. Food was ok but the customer service sucks big time.
439,Well....i guess the most visited place in CP with a big name but there are always some gaps that needs to filled up...all the best!!
440,Food quality was good i ordered penne pasta which was good and rajma chawal tiffin which was not upto the expectation but the staff service was very good and ambience too
441,LOCAL ...It's a good place to visit around in CP. The food taste is good but can be done much better... few things are very spicy ... The springs are quite good... also the rates are also very reasonable...I liked the ambience of the place very much... a good place to go with every age group ... overall it is a good place.
442,"Local is beautiful restaurant with pretty lights and no matter at what time you decide to visit this place, you will love their ambience, the food is delicious and the drinks are really great. "
443,"I went with a couple of friends to spend my Saturday night at Local, CP. To my experience, I got a seat easily and their were quiet a few options except for the Right side of the upper sitting, they said it was closed (although it was after 7pm on a Saturday night) usually other restaurants open some sitting at that hourt. Apart from this, when I called in the waiter to order some beer, to my shock out of 15+ options on the menu they only had 4 also, draught beer which had 6-7 options were not there, none of thatThat was quiet upsetting. Then when we order a pizza, it took almost 30 minutes, to check if it took pizza to bake this long in here, we ordered another one and to our surprise...read more"
444,"Went there on a dinner date. Absolutely not a place to have a conversation. Food was below average, and since I went there on a weekend, there was a long wait time as well. Food and service can be improved multifold. "

451,"Food was good, we ordered palak chat/pav bhaji /chily paneer mocktails etc. The service was average. According to the charges, the atticates by restaurant were bit low. The bill receipt was given in our hand without placing it in any bill card or in a box. They did not served the food, we have to serve ourselves. "
452,Brilliant ambience and spot on service quality. The pricing is good and the area is very spacious and well built. The decor is modern with a combination of classical style but overall it is a sight to put on your wish list. Food is Good but not brilliant.
453,"A perfect place to hangout in CP with college buddies! The vibes are great and the ambience is really good. The food was amazing, particularly the Quesadillasüòã Do pay a visit here‚ù£Ô∏è"
454,Has a great ambiance. The place has a spacious vibe with a great deal of focus in the middle. Lighting is wide but doesn't hurt the eyes. There's seating available on the first level with a balcony view of the floor below. There's enough options to choose from with all the standard cuisines available. Food tasted alright; cocktails took some time but were well prepared. Service staff was polite. Should visit. 
455,The food is amazing and ambience is superb. Must visit place. Only thing they must improve is there staff. Staff is not welcoming and they don't smile when you ask for anything. 
456,Butter chicken was awesome..just love it..and music n all..the environment is just fav..nad the behavior of all workers e so polite specially Mr Dev who gave us all facility.

458,"One of the very few places in CP which are always full and yet they'll always be ready to offer you a seat. Thanks to the huge area they have and the food tastes great. The best part about local is their staff. They are very prompt, whether it's taking order or bringing it to your table or helping you decide what to choose. Loved the aam panna drink. "
459,"Couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better place for a Friday evening!The ambience is lovely, the food is great, the staff is good. We had the Soya Kathi rolls.

469,A little more in the non veg platter 
470,Love this place for the ambience the food and the drinks. Most especially the music! They play English music on Saturdays ( that's when I've always gone there ) and it's great. There are hardly any bars here that play English songs but all Bollywood. Rated 4 only coz of the service. Rest was all good. 
471,"I'll absolutely say its still the best place in CP and will consistently be.Loved the music, feeling and smell. The vibes and music will make your body move. Pizza was likewise mind blowing had immaculate cheddar and topping.Overall, we had a fabulous time there. I would state, this is extraordinary compared to other spot for gatherings in CP."
472,"Yesterday I called at local what offer is going on they told me today we are giving 4+4 on zomato gold,I said reserve table for 3 they told me ok sir.When we arrived they told me we have couple entry only, it's very bad experience when I called that time you people inform to the guest sir/mam we have couple entry only.mr Roy and Mr umang please train your staff thank you so much."

475,The ambiance was quite good and the food worth the price. It was an amazing experience. Must recommended. The service by shankar sam and nabin was good. 
476,"So yesterday me and my friend visited the place at around 4 pm. The staff very rudely refused to allow us entry as one person was wearing slippers. Even the manager refused to come out and explain why the discriminatory policy. If you have any such elitist  policies please clearly state them on your ZOMATO page or outside your restaurant so that somebody‚Äôs day is not soured by your lack of hospitality. Also to anyone who reads this, this place isn‚Äôt half different from any other restaurant at cp, suggest you ditch this one and go somewhere else because you don‚Äôt want the rude staff ruining your day.

477,"Visited this beautiful place today for lunch with my cousins. The lighting is amazing and gives a cheer to the mood. I has 2 floor seating arrangement. We had our table in the upper space as we wanted it to be more we time and it provides some secluded space from the crowd.We started with Palak Patta Chaat, it was crispy and spicy, followed by Chilly Chicken which is a must try here, then we had Drums of heaven, Tiben styled Schezwan momos.My temptation for sea food had us order Prawns, these were equally well cooked and marinated and served our expectations.In drinks we order many but I would recommend 31.

480,It was an amazing experience. The food here is little expensive and the quantity served according to it is very less but the ambience is beautiful and they have fussball too üòçüòç
481,Third grade food..we were 10 people and ordered combination of both veg and non veg starters. Non veg starters to our surprise arrived in leas than 5 mins which was all stale. Veg starters came after good 25 mins to our dismay. I do not understand how people are giving this place good rating. Do not waste your money and go to some other places in cp which are much better than this. This is truly a local place!
482,very good service (lalit rana and satish) food was amazing and over all i had a nice experience.We would like to visit here again. White sauce pasta was the best part.
483,"Enjoyed the climate of the spot. The spot was very full despite the fact that I went on a wednesday evening.The DJ played great songs.Just phenomenal nourishment with incredible flavors. Everything was excessively great. Excellent sustenance and its introduction. We requested sheesha , chicken candies and noodles. The sustenance was lip smacking and the sheesha was excessively smooth. The music was astonishing as well. Simply impeccable spot."
484,"Catch up with an old friend. Loved the ambiance after 7pm the party is on. Let me tell you the food is genuinely delicious specially there non veg tandoori platter and even LIIT all 3 versions we tried it was smooth yet hitting hard. Loved the music, ambiance and aroma.

489,"Local has a nice open feel and uncluttered interiors. There is enough space between tables. The service was quick and staff was helpful.Even though Google lists Local CP as wheelchair accessible, it's not as they have a step at the entrance. A wooden ramp can easily be made to make entry convenient for wheelchair users. Have mentioned same to the manager and hope to see a ramp on my next visit.The food was tasty and portion size was decent as per the price. We ordered the chakna platter which was a mix of nuts and few other munchies.The Amritsari fish was nice and had 6 big pieces. Also ordered the Mumbai pao bhaji and chicken tikka masala.

491,"A Gem of a place located near Scindia House , Connaught Place. A perfect party Ambience with seating on both Ground and First floor. I started off with their Veg Spinach Dimsums and they were perfectly Cooked and I enjoyed it a lot with the red spicy dip they served. Then I moved on to their Pav bhaji which was Prepossessingly presented , had balanced flavours , the Pavs were quite soft and I loved it. In drinks I tried , Cold Coffee and Virgin Mojito , both were Decent and if you love strong coffee then do Order it. At last , ending on a sweet note , I tried their Chocolate Fantasy which was Brownie with ice cream and It was a Great end to my visit . Loved this place Completely. "
492,"One fine Wednesday evening, we decided to hit the CP streets. We quickly looked up on Zomato, and decided to give Local a shot, after already having visited and exited two places. Finally we got what we were looking for at Local- lovely ambience, tipsy lighting, good music that is neither too loud nor too low, and an amazing crowd. We decided to go for baked cheesy nachos to begin with, coupled with two cocktails. The overloaded cheesy nachos were simply appetizing! The best combination with drinks, as always. For the main course, we went ahead with a white sauce veg penne pasta, and a veg pizza. The pizza was not too great, the crust could have been better and the cheese poured more...read more"

But I want to mention few of the dishes which was so good and i want to recommend it as well, cheesy nachos, chicken pizza, pav bhaji, spring roll and tandoori chicken. In drinks I had cold coffee, which was pretty average. and my friends tried Virgin Mojito, Sangaria, LIT.Overall, we had a fantastic time there.

597,"Local is one of the good places to go in connaught place, it situated on the outer circle and is very evident so you will not have any difficulty to locate it. The place is huge so you will not find it difficult to find a nice table to sit. If you are going on weekends the I would recommend you to get reservations done.This time I had gone out to have some drinks so we did not order alot of food just a sizzler which was average but I would like to tell you that their menu is pretty limited and there are not alot of options available.After so much discussion we had to order a sizzler but apart from this their service is quick and the ambience is good.

802,"Interiors and ambience was nice. But I was thoroughly disappointed with food and drinks. The only good thing we ate was spring rolls. Even basic dishes lacked taste. Poor cocktails.And on top of that, we were literally ‚Äúforced‚Äù to write a minimum 140 word review on Zomato so that we can get a free drink! I mean, seriously? Upon refusing the servers started gossiping among themselves and further delayed the last of our services. Not at all happy with this place."

807,"It was my second visit to this place . The place is huge and has an ample space for sitting but still you wont see much crowd in here , I don‚Äôt know for what reason. The place is little dull according to me.Food was below average , we ordered all vegetable pizza and it was cold as ice and hard as brick , chewing that pizza was a one hard task.The place is damn expensive too , even after using Zomato gold ( 2+2 drinks ) our bill turned out to be Rs 1700 for 4 drinks ( mind it we got 2 drinks free on ordering 2 drinks ). So yeah , I would rather like to try some other place is cp which are in budget and have equally good surroundings and better food."

850,Not a good place even if you are good well educated boys. Its upto on the mood of lady at gate to allow or not allow. Manager stand there and does nothing. Despite confirming on call they denied entry. And when we showed that we had iphones she agreed but then we didn‚Äôt go. Horrible experience. Can‚Äôt believe that such discriminating place exists in central delhi. 
851,"Ambience is good. Even Food will not disappoint you üòçüòç service is also up to the mark.. I ordered honey chilli potatoes, chilly garlic Hakka noodles, Diet Coke ."

Right from the decorations, flooring/wall patterns, lighting and the seating arrangements all are made to perfection. The place is well decorated and creates a beautiful atmosphere for having a perfect date. One of attractive features of this place is it perfect sense of lighting. When it comes to food, the food was fine in taste and was not up to the expectations. We have ordered a paan flavor hookah which was uniquely crafted to perfection.

857,"Mostly empty on a Tuesday night hence you would expect the service to be better. On the contrary had to ask 5 times to get a glass of water. That's just the starting. Ordered noodles and they were pathetic, like done by some road side vendor, even they are much better. Who gives these people 5 stars, must be paid marketing. I would not want to go there even if they offer me food for free. "
858,Amazing place.¬†Service - 5/5Food- 4.5/5Variety- 3/5Ambiance- 4.5/5The plating of the dishes was too good. The taste was very nice. The hospitality was commendable. The dishes were served hot. The quantity per plate was just apt. A must visit from my end.
859,"I would never recommend this place to go with friends. The staff is super rude and they really dont know how to talk. Had gone on a tuesday night with a bunch of people. Being stags and even being a tuesday still we werent allowed. And when asked let me have a simple round inside to check whether there are any stags inside, they simply refused coz there would have been there inside. One of the worst ever place to go. "

872,"Just went here yesterday, to meet with friends. The menu is mostly Indian with a mix of continental . We ordered a bunch of kababs and sizzlers for the main course with beers on the sides. The kababs here were really good specially Hara Bhara Kabab... The sizzlers could have been better .Good for lunches and a night out though I would prefer social to this,also found price to be in the little higher side considering the ambience and not so maintained furniture ( which was torn,old and not comfortable)"
873,Had booked the table via zomato for 6 people. The restaurant accommodated us where only 4 people could sit comfortably. The attitude of the waiter was very rude when we asked to change our place and simply said no. As a result we had to go to some other place.
874,A great place to have a night out with your friends. Food is great and so is the service. This place serves some really nice cocktails. Overall vibe and music is also top notch. Laal Maas served is as tasty as it is surprising.
875,I visited this place with my friends on sunday.. the food was not at all good and service was also very bad... the prices are too high and the quality of food is bad ..totally disaatisfied

881,"Going to Local, CP was a sudden plan and turned out, it was a great decision. Amidst the heat roast outside, Local was very chilled and had a very cool vibe atmosphere. We ordered couple of drinks, White Sauce Pasta, Dabeli, veggie delight pizza and it was all very tasty. The pizza was crisp and thin, exactly how I like. The Dabeli was freshly made and was served mild hot. White Sauce Pasta was good too. The servers were very polite and they suggested well the signatures of the place. All in all, a great experience. "
882,"Great service by Kunal and Shankar.Lovely food. Ordered nachos, drums of heaven, and draught beers.Good ambience.Would visit again surely. "

978,"Dear Uday,Radio from the secondary pack is missing, so it nullifies the chances of misplacement in the warehouse, because opening the primary carton only is not allowed in our warehouse.If you are saying that it is not the fault from your company's side,Then have you checked each radio in the box after importing?.Kindly note that If you wish to give the replacement accepting your responsibility for complete quality delivery till the end user.Then you are requested to deliver this input in Kota (Rajasthan) where it was found missing."

The Spicy Gauva Margarita is a must try, as a margarita lover, I recommend it highly! The food is average.

One of the good places in CP for a sit down evening.ordered chicken Tikka masala pizza. Not the best taste, have definitely eaten better but alright.Also, they do one thing which is kind of awkward.

The garlic bread was prepared well with a lot of mushroom and cheese on the top. It was followed by 'my chocolate fantasy'. It is fudge brownie topped with chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream. This was devoured within seconds. Would love to visit again soon!"
1162,"Visited this place with my friends a few days ago. Was mesmerized by the ambience. There's an ample seating space. They have 2 floors for seating. Coming to the food, I had ordered Cheese Nachos, which were okayish. Being a nachos lover, I didn't like them much. Then, I had ordered, Vegetable Pizza, which was amazing. I also ordered Soya Chap, Dahi ke kebab, Veg Croquettes, Paneer Tikka. Dahi Kebabs were very, very sweet. Didn't like them much too. Then, for the desserts, I had the Banoffee Pie, which was the highlight of my visit to this place. This pie was made of Banana, Coffee and hazelnut. Loved it. A good experience, a one time visit place, for sure! "
1163,"Local was on my visit list since its launch due to its amazing ambiance and reviews from friends. Finally visited it and found it worth every praise.I had veg tandoori platter in starters followed by Dal tadka and paneer makhani for main course along with breads. The platter consisted of paneer tikka, dahi kebab, hara bhara kebab and chaap. Every dish was yummy.Paneer was average but dal tadka was amazing with balanced flavors.I loved the service and will come back again soon"
1164,"Want a chill place to hangout with friends? You'll definitely love Local situated in CP. The vibes can uplift your spirits and even kill your mid-week blues.We had Palak patta chaat, Tandoori veg platter, and Mushrooms with parsley garlic and chillies accompanied by Peach iced tea and classic aam panna.Palak patta chaat was crispy and had all the flavours that remind you of street food, but with good hygiene. The platter was succulent with dahi kebab being the most delicious item. Garlic bread topped with mushrooms was hands down one of the best I have had.Aam panna was refreshing with its slight sweet and sour taste."
1165,"Great service by shaming, good music and ambience ! Food had great quantity and was totally worth it despite being costly, Cosmo was really good !!"

1176,We were a group of 4 friends and we went there on the restraunts's reputation but we were disappointed at the food as the pasta which we ordered came quite late as well as cold. Totally not worth the hype
1177,The food was good and so were the drinks... But overall the behaviour was not upto the mark.. It was around 4pm when we visited. As soon as we entered inside we saw that 90% of the seats were vacant hence we requested to be given a couch even though we were only 2 people. As there was no rush they could have easily provided. On the ground floor the couches though available had reserved tag on them so we din't ask for those seats and they told us that please go upstairs we have loads of couches there u can be comfortable there. Upstairs all couches were free but the staff upstairs said no you go down nd get couches there we cannot give two people a couch... So they just kept juggling us...read more

The enormity of the place at a prime location like Connaught Place is really commendable though.I visited the place on a Tuesday evening. The music was good but the overall vibe seemed off. I ordered a couple of dishes & drinks and I did not like any if it.Food - I ordered the American Ceasar Salad first. It had just asparagus, lettuce and dressing. I could find no sun dried tomatoes or rosemary croutons there as the menu suggested. My next pick was the spinach and mushroom momos. It tasted a bit better than the salad for sure. But I have tasted better...read more"

1290,"Me and three of my friends went to Local based on net reviews and recommendations of a cousin for lunch on 11th May, a day before elections in Delhi. As it turns out it was a dry day and our enthusiasm was slightly dampened. But we thought the food is going to be great, so we went ahead. the ambience is great, no doubt and the servers seemed very eager to help us which was nice. we joked around with them for a bit too and then ordered our drinks. The mojito I ordered was ok, nothing to shout out about but not bad either, maybe a little too sour for my taste. But the iced tea my friend ordered, kala khatta flavour, was flavourless. She managed to gulp down barely half of it and then...read more"
1291,"Recently went to Locals in CP, Delhi with my mother. Heard its good and the rating was also good. Ordered Tandoori veg platter which was very good. Every item on the platter had it own unique taste. Long Island Electric Tea LIIT was upto the mark with good amount of alcohol. Overall a good experience. Went on a Thursday night, so there was no DJ playing. Only the pre-selected songs were on the go."
1292,"Love the environment , the crowd and the DJ specially. It was great to be here . chicken was good . only veg champ needs to be taken care of "
1293,Excellent service by Pratap Singh. Great service. Good food and drinks. Great ambience to hang out with friends. Good music. Great location. 
1294,One of the best ambience in Connaught place specially in ground level. Though they are out of stock for some beers otherwise food and vibes are too good. Staffs are friendly. Thumbs up for local.

1298,"Love the place. The music, the experience - it's a good party place.But only a party place. The service is a little lagged though. Don't blame them - they're always full."
1299,"I went to this place to celebrate my wife's birthday. This place is very spacious with two floors and with proper sitting arrangements.Though it had a good space with grooving music played by DJ but still no one was dancing till the time we were there. May be they were also waiting for someone else to start as we did.Lol.Jokes apart, this place is very happening with good food and service. They had all varieties of alcohol. I would like to visit this place again and would recommend to others also.Food - 5/5Ambience-5/5Service -5/5"
1300,"Located in center of Delhi , one of the most happening lounges with rock solid vibe . Running full on a tuesday evening is an achievement that speaks for itself.

1302,I've always loved this place for its ambience and they spacious area. The food here is good and they have a variety of beverages you can choose from. Also it's quite pocket friendly 
1303,Saturday night party place!This place gets on you as the night progresses! They probably keep increasing their volume!The food wasn't good and was below expectations. Infact it was so poor that there was no salt in one of our starters. The service was poor too but the hukka they served was good. The beer that is being served is probably the best you can find in CP but the prices are on a higher side.Choose the place if you want loud music and good ambience !
1304,The outlet had great ambiance. As it was a dry day they weren't serving any alcohol but that wasn't a problem for me. The food was great and service was prompt as well. I would like to recommend mock tails served by locals as they were really good. Overall i would recommend the place to anyone planning to visitService 4/5Ambiance 4/5Food 4/5Overall 4/5
1305,Restaurant ambience is really cool and food is good but I tried varieties of beer unfortunately temperature was not appropriate I have to use ice which I really hate with beer. 
1306,"LOCAL is one of the highly recommended Bar at CP.I would say they serve perfectly cooked food with nice texture and gesture. Little slow in service but that all can be neglect as they are in high demads everytime from everybody.Sitting space is fare enough and the best part music is not too loud, where u can chat easily without shouting.Overall m very much impressed and giving 4 out of 5 star this time.Happy to visit again and hoping to give 5 star next time.Thank you üëèüëè"
1307,Ab exotic place. Easy to communicate with staff. The environment is also great. The decor is just up to the mark. The quality and quantity of food are both just up to the mark. Their drinks are served very gently.üíï‚ù§Ô∏èüòçüòç

1318,"After being segregated to the stag section which I personally find offensive, but due some dirt and grim all have to go through this, anyways the beer üç∫ was damn cheap out here which was a good thing, we ordered food ü•ò on recommendation of the server and he made a mistake while ordering one dish so in return we were offered 20% discount on our bill which seemed a fair deal, it was a good experience,  3.5/5 would be my rating "
1319,Enjoyed the music and ambiance.. Also the interior is designed in awesome way.. The food was good but you can work upon the service on table.. First of all I had to call the waiters many time then they would listen once and when I ordered the food it arrived quite late..

1322,The chicken tikka pizza and cheese nachos were beyond amazing.Shamian's service was curteous.Will surely make a second visit :)Will also recommend my friends for the place.
1323,Worst places for a single person to eat lunch. Discrimination starts at the moment you enter this place. They make you sit in the corners/ upstairs even when the whole god damn place is empty.  The over priced stuff that you pay for is for ambience that is stolen from you. Should be given zero but 1 star is mandatory. 
1324,"Though the ambiance of local is great but then it‚Äôs way to expensive! Like we were 2 people and we ordered a pizza(veg), chilly potato, spring roll and 2 beers ,it costed us 3500-3700( I don‚Äôt remember exactly).Even the taste of food is not worth the price, the pizza was almost burnt.I have three stars only because of the quick delivery and staffs behaviour."
1325,"Good service, will always recommend. Appreciate Naveenüëçüèª. Ambience, music, and overall ambience is really nice. Would like to get my frns back to this place"
1326,"The initial waiter was a bit rude but Naveen was friendly. I recommend asking for him. The food is good, cuisine needs a lil work. The ambience is good. I recommend this place for good weekend meals."

Team manager or senior staff was cooperative and polite however dedicated server/waitor was kind of funny, rude and impolite. Most of the requests were responded with straight NO not willing to accommodate any request.Though guy was quite prompt in asking for a tip. üòú. Overall nice place to hang out with friends and corporate groups. Thanks"

But two issues quanity in main course and your staff service is very slow especially during lunch.

All of them tasted pretty nice. They have a fine selection of spirits. The service is very prompt and responsive. The place was pretty much occupied and vibrant and has several large LED screens that show cricket matches.For main course, it was yellow dal, rice, tandoori rotis, a chicken curry, a paneer dish. Pretty well made again. They have a smoking room and hence you wouldn‚Äôt need to step out to smoke. Clean toilets maintained to supplement the flow of booze out of you!

1420,"Lovely place to enjoy your food and drinks on a Saturday night. Would recommend to try their non veg platter. Portions are on reserved sides, nevertheless quality and taste makes up for it. Prices could have been placed more competitively. In all, local ensures you have a good evening. Special mention to the courteous staff and our server Mr. Satish.Tip: Good place to unwind and enjoy your evenings with music. Nonetheless, not a date place if you plan to have any conversation."
1421,Decent looking pub... good ambiance... great finger food... big quantities.. I also enjoyed the really tall LIIT..made to perfection ... perfect place to hang out with friends!!!! I quite enjoyed my evening out with colleagues!!!
1422,Food is okay but service quality is very bad and needs to be worked upon.You need to ask staff multiple times for service. Establishment at such posh address can do much better. 
1423,Amazing food and delicious cocktails. Our waiter was the sweetest; very friendly and helpful. We loved the mood there and sat for hours.Recommended
1424,"Okay so let me start by saying that their staff is very rude. When we first came in the local, they greeted us as usual but after we asked for the cheque, we saw that they added service tax and GST both and as per new law, service tax is not mandatory to pay. So me and my fellow friends decided not to pay the service tax,the manager came to us and asked the same about service tax. He agreed later on but the staff threw bill at our table after that and started making faces at as.After that when we were leaving the same guy for the staff was taking to another staff member and both were staring at us and didn't even smile as we leaving.Pathetic. Never going here again."
1425,Amazing place with friendly staff and outstading ambience.Komal was the guy who attended us and he was courteous and polite and friendly!The food was delicious specially baked cheese nachos
1426,Good place to hangout with friends with good music and ambience and they also have different varieties of food and starters and also the drinks menu with great cocktails and mocktails are there.

1428,"I am giving one star because there is no option of negative rating.. never met a more hostile staff than this. My 2 and 1/2 yr old kid loves the dance floor. And according to the management kids are not allowed on the dance floor.. if not then they shouldn't allow kids inside. My kid was actually pleading and crying to go on the dance floor. We requested the staff that we'll carry him in our r arms,. But the staff did not budge and finally had to manage and pacify a crying kid the whole time we were there. Pathetic.. will not recommend this place. Have been to so many pubs around but never have we received this kind of treatment.."
1429,Absolutely rubbish place.. never experienced such a hostile staff.. food was ok.. not worth the money.. spoiled my evening here..will make sure not to recommend this place to anyone

1446,"Nice and spacious ambience, food was good, wine was delicious and kuddos to Sandeep for being so friendly and polite! I'd recommend it to someone wanting to throw a bday bash. "
1447,"Let's just start with ""I had high hopes with this place and now I m hopeless"". I tried it on a Sunday evening. The look of the place is that of a club but no where near to that feel. I mean this could've been the best club on the block with that kinda dance floor but no. Anyway the disappointment was not the ambience it was the food. We had ordered a variety and was disappointed in all thinking not all the dishes are from the same continent. The problem is western dishes are indianized and Indian dishes are westernised. I don't know what they were trying to achieve. The drinks are classic brews so yay me. And the staff is courteous. Its more of a after dinner drinks kinda place....read more"
1448,"Pratap Singh was a very gentle, humble and polite. We had chilli paneer, Thela chowmein, mushroom alfredo, khatta pudina. The food was very tasty. This place has cozy ambience. Highly recommended. "

1454,"Still here. Had heard a lot about this place, since we are in the hospitality industry as well. Unfortunately, the experience was marred towards the end. The beginning was good, and food was alright, albeit not the best. We ordered kebabs, pizza and chicken panko, and drinks along with that. We wanted to order some coffee as well, but were informed by the server that it is not good and we should order something else. We found that to be a benevolent act on his part, however that continued several times in the evening. Either certain items need to be removed from the menu, or servers need to be taught how to sell the items the restaurant cum bar has. Later, we ordered chicken drum sticks...read more"

1473,This is one of the most well known place in Connaught place. Also it is a very cool place to chill and hangout with your buddies and friends in Connaught place !! No doubt the inside decor of LOCAL is Lit than any other caf√© seen before. We enjoyed our food and drinks alongside by watching live cricket match which was shown on their big screen. We were seated on the first floor which was quite good. In food we ordered here Masala soya chaap and Paneer tikka (Two ways) which tasted really yum and Lipsmacking served with green chutney and onions. I liked their presentation of Paneer tikka as it was quite different and intriguing. In beer we ordered Two Stellaartois Pint as other brands...read more
1474,"Sanjeet Save, Surya Prabhakar and Me went to this place to have a quick drink before we head out on a pre-decided dinner plan. The place was huge and felt like a cocktail of vintage decor and modern menu came together.We were seated on the upper area and I loved the view form up top. Music was blah, food was ok and the service was quick. Not a place to have grand plans but a casual get together with friends can fit in well. "
1475,I went there with friends. The pizzas were not that cheesy. More cheese should be added. The food was tasty and the service was great. üòäüòäüòä

1483,"For only couple entry, this needs to be intimated Publicly until we don‚Äôt reach we got no info. Also you could have cover charge to let the stags in."
1484,The food was decently good but the alcohol was diluted. We found a strand of hair in our food but the waiter refused to accept that it happened in their kitchen. The ambience is great but my overall experience wasn't that great.

Had this amazing mouthwatering, soft and delicious brownie with two scoops of ice cream drizzled with chocolate sauceü§§ü§§Perfect dessert to fulfill sweet tooth cravingsEven order pizza and pasta and they both were so good and very awesome place to visit with friends and bae"

The biggest plus point is that it is in CP, easily accessible. Stags are not allowed here. The place ssits on 2 floors and is generally occupied on weekends. This is a place to enjoy with your friends, celebrate birthdays, have fun and mind you, the music is loud here. Food & drinks are good, desserts are better, although we tried only the Banoffee Pie.

1496,"Perfect ambience for friends, colleagues and owns company. Amazing food and service by Pratap Singh.Well understanding and efficient working staff..."
1497,"I went to this place with my friends because it was one of the Zomato Gold inclusive places. The ambience was nice, the food was a bit overpriced. The funniest part was even though this place was mostly vacant, our server kept on bugging is for an order even after everything we had ordered was on the table and we were clearly talking amongst us. That put a bit of a dampner on things. Otherwise its a nice place to chill in. "
1498,Local doesnt actually justify its name üòÇIts a lot more sophisticated. The ambience is nice. The bar and food menu has ample options to choose from. But It's a must visit place.
1499,"Amazing place any day be it weekend, weekday. Best service I've had so far. Come with 2 people come with a group you'll never be disappointed. Thanks a ton to Mr. Sandeep for the amazing service. Best experience ever."

1502,"A decent place to hangout with office collegues and friends . They play soft music and the ambience is also goood. But dahi kebabs are average here. Pizzas here are awesome. But talking about pricing, its bit high."
1503,"Seeing the ratings i thought of checking out this place!Honestly, i felt the ambience was really cool but the food and the alcohol is a bit over-priced.They do not even serve indian beers though they have mentioned in their menu which is why ultimately you would have to spend money on expensive ones!Did not really try out their main food items as we only had beer and peanut chakna.Overall i would say if you are looking for a great ambience and have a great budget, then you can try out this place."
1504,The place has very awesome vibe and music.It is a family place and the food was appreciableGood place to hang out and enjoy with friendsI will definatly recommend this place to my friend and family memberNavin

Talking about this place, such huge property is rare to find in this area with seating capacity of around 200 pax. and standing capacity of approx. 500 pax. at one go. Having said that, they have not only limited themselves to accommodate such huge masses at one go, but also have beautifully managed it in such a way that one will not face the space constraints here.

Someone should have assisted to get us seated. And after that we have to pull chairs on our own as it as small table. Service is also bad. Music is nice and go appropriately with theme and atmosphere.Food is okay. I like the veg dishes I ordered including hummus. Non veg dishes weren't great. Chicken tikka was bad. Overall a mix of experience but yes lot to improve "

1708,"Overall a Nice place , Good ambience & food . Very spacious . Comfortable seating . DJ üî•These days a lot of places have started a little Scam to get good reviews on Zomato , unfortunately Local is one of them . The server insists that you give a 5 star review before you leave , even willing to type it himself .This is just absurd .The Hostesses are quite cold & unaccomodating . Borderline rude . Which is surprising as the Servers offered us Great service .Overall had a Good time , highly recommended , will visit again ."
1709,"Nice place but the staff is not at all courteous or helpful hence given them 1*. Although 80% of seats were vacant still they refused to move us to another table even though Hookah is banned they are serving it illegally and we didn‚Äôt like to be in the smoking zone hence, they should have done everything possible to make us comfortable yet they didn‚Äôt. Marshmallow shake - 3.5*It‚Äôs more like vanilla shake couldn‚Äôt taste where exactly marshmallow was in the shake but still it was good.Penne Arrabiata Pasta - 4*Quiet decent pasta with authentic taste served with garlic bread. A must try after the big bang burgers. "
1710,This place has ample space of sitting. Once again I have used zomato gold for having beer. The rate of liquor is not so high as compared to others. One bad part of that restaurant was the over fragrance of room freshner which was little bit uncomfortable. The staffs were very active and service was good.

1723,Located in middle of CP Delhi!! Menu is based on local street food !!We were very excited but it did not went well through. Being that place I ordered pav bhaji and cheese chilli toast. Pav bhaji was very tasteless and cheese chilli toast was very soggy.¬†We did not enjoyed our experience and would not recommend the same.
1724,We went out at the place by looking at the photos and menu from zomato. The place ambience was dull.Anyways we had our food over their. The place is nicely decorated and I have been to their Saket outlet as well. But this place is not that good as it was.Food was average. Spring rolls were very below average. Nothing much exciting as like other outlets 38 barracks or MOB. If other places are full I would recommend going here.

1728,"Genuine Review about Local Cafe, CP.Visited this cafe today. Ambience is really beautiful as you can see. Staff is courteous and friendly.One thing, which I guess I am unaware of or they are doing il-legal.

Local is a very beautiful place adorned with marvellous interiors and lights. The place is huge and has ample seating space. They host some crazy DJ and live singing nights and all of them have an amazing crowd and a crazy vibe. It is on the more expensive end of the scale but is worth your money. The food and the beverages are outstanding and this is probably one of my favorite places in CP.I strongly recommend trying it out once and you certainly won't regret it."

2151,"I went there with four of my friends on 1st January and I don't think I have received such a poor service at any place ever. First of all, none of the waiters came to even ask us for order even after calling them multiple times. Then, we had to struggle again to get ourselves some water. And the fun fact is they were not even occupied, and was just chatting among themselves, one of them was sitting and just reading something but was not ready to serve us water. Their food was average though. Spring rolls, pizza and chicken malai tikka was average but paneer cigar rolls were too oily and bland, I don't even know why is it even there in their recommendation. And we had to struggle again to...read more"

2153,"Went there for a dinner with friends on a Sunday. There was already a lot of crowd and the place was full. Mainly went there for cocktails which were good, even their vodka and aam panna shots were nice though the alcohol content was really less. The music was great, ambience was good too. Somehow the service was so slow that it kind of dampened the whole experience for us. We had to wait for 30-40 to get our drinks and another 20 mins for the second round and food. The food was good, nothing spectacular. In general when we have so many options to choose from in CP, we'll probably not come to this place again"
2154,Great place to enjoy live sports with friends with beer and alcohol along. Service is very quick and its cost friendly too. Didnt liked the vape concept but still I recommend this place.

2169,"Wanna party don't forget to be here, amazing food and drinks with really nice music that will blow your mind out of anywhere.Must visit this place. But it is expensive as hell the price doesn't match"
2170,JP Yadav is the man if you are visiting this place. He was a wonderful host and took good care of all ur needs. Local is not so local as it's standards of maintaining the quality r very good. A must visit place. 
2171,The place was pretty lit.But we went there for sheesha and that wasn't available unfortunately.The ambience and crowd was too good.Recommended. 
2172,"I don‚Äôt understand how this restaurant fallUnder rating 4 category. The service was not good. Over rated , over priced and the food , I would rather go to any street and have spring roll , chowmein and parantha too.Nothing fancy , not they have something different presentation or food which we easily get from any of the local food eatery.Anyway !All the best !"
2173,"Quality, Quantity and Presentation of the food at this place is great! It is a good spot for hangout with your friends and family. We went here for weekend day time meal and crowd here was nice. It is a nice place for 'Local' / 'Random' hangout."
2174,I went der on sunday..ordered veg tandoori sizzler and chilli paneer cigar rolls...tandoori platter was gudd bt quantity was lil nd cigar rolls were ok we ordered marshmellow shakes and junoon ka fal..dat were gudd
2175,"I visit dis place for the very first time with my friends last week and we order spring roll, hakka noodles, cold coffee,vanilla shake and mojito so i must say owesome place for hangout. Food was amazing in taste and eye catching in presentation also. Crowd was awesome, best place and we had a blast with dj."
2176,"Food quality and quantity, nothing worked for me.Plus the music was really bad, don‚Äôt even try to have that Chakna platter, rest if you sit on the first floor the ceiling is right on your head, so just be careful while dancing.Thanks "
2177,"Its a quiet place some how it seemed like family dine , i got bored here on my birthday expecting a lot from here food was fine i left the place because of boring dj night"
2178,The mezze platter was full of frozen items. The service was too slow and the staff was unresponsive. The quantity of items in the vegetarian love sizzler was less. Everything was way too expensive for the quantity served. 
2179,The food was not upto the mark in relative to the prices charged. The ingredient used was frozen cakes in the platter instead of cooking it themselves. The staff was not friendly and unresponsive.
2180,"The food was not up to the mark as compared to the prices. The mezze platter was full of various frozen items, which one can eat at home at reasonable price. Plus the staff was very unresponsive. The cafe change the items of the dish on their own.. "
2181,"The ambience is on point and very beautiful. The food is okayish but the staff is very friendly. We ordered hakka noodles with hot garlic sauce and pizza. The noodles are tasty but the pizza is not that good. The thin crust fails to keep the toppings on and is too soft. The drinks are nice. It is a budget friendly place and if you are going there, reach after dark."
2182,Most happening place with a huge and incredible ambience.They managed a team party of 24 people with nice services.Loved being there.Special thanks to Tashi and Deepak the managers and Kamal the serving staff.Thanks guys.
2183,Extremely uncomfortable; they have laid the place like a decent cafe but DJ plays music that is loud and doesn't suit the mood and decor of the place at all. We tried to speak with the assistant to help locate us a place that has lesser exposure to sound but he smirked at us saying that it is going to be even louder.Forget about having a good conversation over a beer here. 
2184,I loved the place. Spacious and an amazing ambience. Our servers Nimshim and Sushil have been really kind and helpful.Food was brilliant. Ordered spring rolls and Paneer Cigars. Yum. Truly. I would be visiting this place again. Will be ordering more things here. 
2185,"Amazing place to Hangout with friends, good music, having limited drinks option price is ok ,else food is good with fast service and having ample space."
2186,Ambience is quite good. Took a little longer for food to arrive. Went on weekend maybe that's why! Food is normal as compared to the prices charged. An over rated place to be honest:)
2187,"From ambiance to food, this place will fulfill all your expectations. I would recommend one to visit this place at night.Perfect place to hang out with your friend circle. "
2188,We were in delhi for some work so we decided to hop on places for drinks.Local is one good place. Great place with good food and music.Rustic interior and friendly staff. Overall a good experience. Must visit üòä
2189,"Underrated place, actually it deserves more than 4.3 stars. Really spacious and nice ambiance. Good food and DJ. I would recommend this over similar one in CP area."
2190,The ambience at this place is really great! It's also pretty huge and the food is delicious..We were served by Maniram who was very polite and courteous.This is a must visit especially during December with all the Christmas Decorations!
2191,"Terrible service and pathetic food. I had high expectations from this place as it was rated quite well on Zomato, but the service was extremely slow. The waiters were rude and food was pathetic."
2192,"Local, located at 11, KC Marg, Scindia House is yet another fine addition to the ever growing club and lounge culture of Delhi‚Äôs heart Connaught Place. Located close to Metro stations ‚Äì Rajiv Chowk, Janpath and Barakhamba Road, it is a popular destination for a casual dining experience.Located at the corner of the street, Local is tough to miss out due to its wooden exterior finish.

2200,"Like every social, this one too comes with a theme of it's own. With little carriage like structures suspended from thr ceiling just below the metro station, it is a fun experience dining with a little swing from the metros coming in and out, above.

2270,Food is good 3.5/5Ambience and space is good 4.5/5Music awesome 4.75/5But the issue is about the knowledge of staff about food and major ingredients i.e which fish is used in Thai curry.2nd issue was a little tedious task in the beginning to make the staff aware of the zomato gold offer in detail but finally all went well and gud. Staff is polite otherwise.Last but not the least the have a special offer running specially for writing a review for them on zomato....a sweet treat... M still waiting for that while I write this. üòõüòõA must visit place in Delhi in your bucket list. You will definitely love the ambience and the huge space. Kudos!We were served by Mr. R. K.

2282,"So you don't let stags enter at all, neither on weekends nor on weekdays, neither in afternoon nor evening. You don't even care to charge a hefty fee as entry charge or cover charge, you simply shut off stags. So usual respectable pubs all around the country don't do that, they let stags enter either in weekdays or atleast with a entry charge. Change your policies and make them more friendly. If not, mention it somewhere, zomato or a board outside, so that people won't travel miles to try out your hyped place. "
2283,"Sanjay provided such a good service :)American Ceasars salad is one of the amazing dish here. Pasta can get much better though. And if you will write a review, you get free brownie ice cream. Cheers!! "

2322,Over all the place is good but staff over here is doing little bit of scamThey tell you they are offering complementary drinks and in return they want you to add some good ratings and reviews online and in the end they will add all complementary stuff in your bill.This happend with me and I couldn‚Äôt realize this until i went through the bill 2 days later of my visit 
2323,The ambiance was good. Music was soothing and light. We could talk with each other. We ordered LIT and it was great. The food was however simple and could have been better.

2391,Amazing experience at local. RK Rahul gave us an amazing experience.  He was very helpful and very courteous.  the food was amazing. Ambience is totally out of this world and I really want to come here again and again
2392,The ambiance is really nice and chill. I went on Friday night the food is good we tried paneer tikka and farmhouse pizza. The thing I don't like is the dj it started so late and when it got started people were not interested is the music he was playing. We were expecting for some good Bollywood or Punjabi songs which he didn't play was just playing some boring music.
2393,This place has a nice vibe to it. I cannot forget their Chai punch cocktail and will keep returning here specially for that. Otherwise I liked their Mushroom alfredo as it was loaded with mushrooms and the flavor of the sauce was good. The accompanying garlic bread was also tasty. 
2394,Great place to spend Friday night. Pratap Singh was a great host and super friendly during our time. Do visit the place for its special mocktails and spring rolls.
2395,The environment is too great and the helping nature of Sankar and Sandeep serving is too cool .keep loving .must try Dahi Kabab and paneer .:P
2396,Well won‚Äôt say it was great experience like i had earlier of ths place.!!! it was normal.. not upto the mark.. like my frnds were first time visitors.. they didn like it as they want some musical ambience.. which was lacking there.!! Food was good no doubts.. but mocktails needs improvement.. it was not my frst visit there.. disappointed ths time.!! :(
2397,"I visited this place with couple of friends and ordered mock tail ‚Äú Botalan sharab diyan‚Äù, ‚Äú golgappe shots‚Äù, ‚Äú Burger‚Äù and ‚Äú faluda‚Äù so review of ‚Äú pot_of_flavours‚Äù is..Taste-4*Presentation-4*Service-3*Ambience-4*Value for money-3.8*So overall experience was pretty good and I can recommend this place if you looking for cool place with tasty food to hang out with friends with good music..üòÑ"
2398,"Service is very good. R k Rahul full marks for ur serviceability. Keep it up. Food taste good , neat and clean. Good ambiance. Music is ok . All over experience great."
2399,I have visited this place with my friends. The staff is polite and courteous.  They helped us in selecting proper food items from number of varities of food items and drinks. We had tandoori veg platter and mushroom alfredo pasta. It was amazing. 
2400,Ohh man! First of all the service is amazing! You just order and they have your dish ready for you. Food is really good. Highly recommended. However I don‚Äôt understand why they don‚Äôt let singles sit in the ground floor area! 
2401,Great place with good ambience. Amazing food especially the Pizzas and peri peri sauce pasta are a must try.I have been to this place for lunch and for a party and it is a delight either way.
2402,"Liked the ambiance, the food not so much though. A nice place to visit with friends and colleagues for drinks. May visit again if out of options."
2403,Was longing to visit this huge corner in the heart of cp and finally had a chance to visit. This place is great and their chakhna platter is the showstopper. Though the makhana needs more spices and it was bland. LIIT was equally good and a perfect blend of liquors.
2404,The place is awesome with great food!!!!!!! Must visit place for tasty food. The ambience is amazing and staff is very cordial. #goodfood#local
2405,Ambience is good..... Food is nyc... Shots were good...... Went for a friend's birthday celebration nd had a great time..... Cheesy loaded nachos were good and kunal was really helpful
2406,Really a nice place to hangout with friends...Food was amazing ..tandoori platter and nachos must have for veggies....service was great...ambience was really nice..#local#CP............

2409,Food is amazing as well as the ambience is to good to chill out.. It‚Äôs a good place to hangout out with ur friends.. as there is also live music üé∂ The best thing is the also accept Zomato gold üòÇ
2410,Good place to chill around while in cp. went there with cousin the ambience was good. We have ordered non veg platter and peanut masala with margarita pizza. Food was good value for money. Can visit once while in cp.
2411,"The establishment is large but the food is not good in enough. I can't remember any other than chicken tikka which tasted good. Usually they are out of stock for beer and only serve corona or white rhino...which is not ""Local"" like to be honest. All in all just not recommended for a good eat out experience."
2412,It‚Äòs a proper disco feeling. Dj playing in the centre.It‚Äôs just Amazing to see that.Perfect lighting. And you must try their signature cocktails. Chicken wings are just yummmmm.
2413,"Nice place to hangout, we went in group, it was good ambience and excellent service by Pratap. Food was good but could be better. Overall it was great experience."
2414,"One of the best cafe that you can visit in CP, though its a bit heavy on the pocket the service and the food somewhat makes up for it. Local lives upto it's reputation of serving great quality Italian food with great ambience.The crowd is good and prestigious. A perfect spot for hanging out with friendsOverall I would rate it 4.5Value for money 4Food 5Service 4"
2415,Below average food. Very limited options and the taste is also not upto mark at all The music here was also very average. The ambience is the only strong point here. Everything else was diasspointing. 
2416,Good place to chill and hang out.kala khatta shots are good.food is amazing specially the peri peri spaghetti is amazing so is chola bhature and pizza
2417,This place is really nice and warm. Highly recommend to come and enjoy the company of your friends. Mansi is really helpful sweet and friendly. üòçüòç‚ù§Ô∏è

2420,Its a best place to hangout with friends. And mansi is really Friendly. We really enjoyed our friends birthday party. I love to hangout here. üòäüòçüåü
2421,"One word for the experience is not so good and not so bad.The only point here I feel is that the moment I told them I have Zomato Gold 2+2 on drinks, I had to wait for hours to get my complimentary drinks.Not a good experience at all."
2422,"One of the finest place in Delhi m, if you are willing to go for a classic dine in Delhi.I only visited once there but I just fall in love with food & their ambience... will be back very soon.. üòçüòç"
2423,"This was my first visit to Local , after strong recommendations from friends about the food and ambience of the place. Local didn't only live up to the expectation , it exceeded that, with one of the most hospitable and humble staff, I've come across lately. Deep was the guy , who was managing our table and he did a pretty good job. The only thing which I missed was an open area , which would have been ideal in winters , hence going with a 4 star. "
2424,Mani ram/Kunal provided a great service to us...really enjoyed partying here...Thanks for making this night a wonderful experience to us will visit again
2425,"What a place. The food, atmosphere everything is quite good. One thing to say staff is to appreciated for all the work. Food-9/10Will visit again? No doubt in that"
2426,"This place is really spacious, the biggest cafe in cp space wise I have ever visited , nice ambience, decor but guys you really need to be best in service, service is very slow, not professional at all, waiters just didn't listen anything..the things we ordered came very late even water also, and some waiters is very rude in behavior, restaurant is good but alot more to do."
2427,"Great ambience.., one of the most spacious pub in cp.  Food is average though.. i had ordered white sauce pasta and pizza .. but overall nice experience "

Nothing spectacular.Food : 4Ordered Soya chap and it was just amazingCheese nachos were also goodand the French fries were also good.The best part of this place is u can sit and enjoy it drinks or food for as long as u want.It's cozy and comfortable."
2430,"Mani ram was very helpful. The service, food, music, ambience was great!The place was very spacious and the staff was very accommodating .Thoroughly enjoyed my evening with my friends!"

2433,"Not a good place for foodies nmusic lovers.They confirmed on phone that there is an event but on reaching there, there was no event at all.Even the DJ started late."
2434,"Mani ram was an amazing person to deal with. Been very polite and respectful, got everything that I need in a snap of a finger.Good person to always ask for ü§ó"
2435,Located at the heart of Connaught Place Local Bar and Cafe is an another amazing cafe to chill out with friends and family. According to my review I would rate the ambience 4 out of 5 and the food 4.5 out of 5 stars. Service was also good but I will still recommending them to work on their interior a little more üëç. . Their outstanding taste and presentation of makhani Pav bhaji and cigar rolls drooled me over . Good luck Local üëçüëçüòç
2436,It was my first visit to this well hyped place. The ambience was Okayish and the servers are not really interested in serving. The menu is too large. I ordered the Shawarma pockets which had guacamole which is a disgrace to both Mexican and Arabic cultures. The cocktail I ordered was simple but was made horribly and was not smooth at all. The bar tender needs a proper education in how to make cocktails. The only saviour was the peanut masala we ordered. Thank God for peanuts!
2437,This is one of the craaaziest party places in Delhi and they serve brilliantly tasty shots at super cheap prices!!The DJ is awesome too!Highly recommended as a party destination .I'm most definitely coming back here. :D
2438,Area was nice and ambience was great.... Love it... Try once in a lifetime.. Superb service... Delicious platter... Delicious chakhna... Music was soothing.. Service by Mr dilip

2441,"A place with a good concept but lesser options. Like many other places, it boasts of an extensive food and drinks menu but doesn't deliver when it comes to ordering. Half of the items are either unavailable or the staff doesn't know what it contains. The ambience is good but the portion size of the food disappoints if compared towards the prices."
2442,"Local is one of the happening place amongst the Connaught place as their ambience , lighting, decor everything is just perfectüëåI ordered chilly potatoes, soya chaap , spring rolls and chole bhature, every dish was yummy except chole bhature they were tasteless, only their presentation was nice. "
2443,awesome ambiance lovely music delocious food very happy with service mr. Deep & Dilip make our time happy we will visit the place again n againthanks Dewp
2444,"Had a great time, nice food. Do order the paranthe, value for money and sumptuous meal. Local excels in Indian chat to Italian cuisine. Nice ambience and servers. Special thanks to our server Vijay Kumar. "
2445,"I order sizzling chicken platter & chakna platter with wishky and different different cocktail I must say, one should really give them a try. Both recommend BY RK Rahul were amazing. The beer chicken had a very subtle whereas the other one literally fired up my tastebuds. Both the dishes created a balance. The chicken was perfectly cooked. The place was great and the restaurant was very big. But overall experience was good. The place has some great offer Zomato gold. DON'T FORGET. TO CHECK THEM OUT.... I would like RK Rahul be the alway served me..üëç‚ù§Ô∏èüòòüí•"
2446,"For the past 1 years local has been one of my favourite restaurant in Delhi.

This good place for family and friends you must go and try cocktail. .. totally in love with this placeüòòüòöüòÄüòÄ"
2447,"The places is very huge and well priced. The ambience is good but the service is bad. After repeatedly telling the server for drinks with less ice, you get 7-8 ice cubes in it. The food quality is good but a little expensive."
2448,"Ambience is just superb specially those cute little paint filled tiles as you enter the place.  Food is overall good, really liked the dry chilly paneer and coffee toffee drink is also nice mocktail. Service tends to get a bit slow but the staff is nice and polite. Table for 4 is a little small and could not accommodate a lot of stuff. Good place to chill and spend the weekend overall.  "
2449,Great place great ambienceüòçJust love the way we spend time in local cp‚ù§Perfect place to have meet up and enjoy soothing. I visit here frequentlyüíô
2450,Our waiter was Deep. Really cool guy. Loved the service. Loved the vibe. Loved the booze. 10/10 for hospitality. Definitely would come back again. 
2451,"The ambience and interiors of this place is quite nice and has a nice vibe to it. The staff is also courteous and provides a decent service. We ordered both veg and non veg dishes. In non veg we ordered Chicken Tikka and Chicken Shwarma Pockets. The chicken tikka was quite amazing and tender. The chicken shwarma pockets on the other hand were served cold. They were served with hummus which was absolutely delicious but as the dish was cold, we didn‚Äôt enjoy it. In veg section we ordered Paneer Cigars. They were nice and hot. We also ordered LIIT which was okayish when compared to other places. Overall a good experience. "
2452,"Food- 4.5/5Drinks 5/5Ambience 4.5/6Service 3.5/5Everything was superb just the service was slow maybe due to crowd .drinks were awesomeMusic was goodIf you are up for a party this is a good placeHuge place, amazing experience"

2458,"Dilip, our service person was very courteous. Food and drinks were good. Ambience is very nice. Mix sauce pasta was delicious. Music is also very good"
2459,"Ambience - 4/5Food - 3/5Service - 3/5This place is huge. The music is good. We had ordered European sizzler and I was disappointed with that. Also, a lot of the beer in the Menu was not available which is kind of a big irritant as I had to order from the few available beers they had and not what I wanted to order from the menu.

2484,"Nice ambience and good food, it was my first visit and I had a great time with my friends, nachos is recommended, One of the place to visit in CP"
2485,Local is one of my favourite places. I‚Äôve been to this place many times. I must say the ambience is superb. Staffs were very friendly. Food quality is perfect. Enjoyed alot. 
2486,first of all i booked it and already red the tips. it was written that no stag allow on weekends but we went today that is on monday and we did'nt allow to enter at the desk only they told us that no stags allow really wanted to visit this place but could'nt beacuse they do not allow stags üòì
2487,"Horrible service. Staff is rude, impolite, mannerless, unprofessional and they try to fudge the bill and cheat the clients.The manager is least bothered about anything. He is indifferent to all the fuck ups happening here.Although food is delicious but the horrible staff and poor service turns the whole experience into a nightmare"
2488,"Ambience : Lively, spacious, 2 floor seating plus VIP lounge adds upto amazing ambience.Cuisine : The food is as disappointing as beautiful the ambience is!We ordered Chilli Chicken which was very salty & Farmer Vegetable Pizza which was tasteless.We wanted to order Herb Crusted Sole Fillet but they were serving Basa fish which can be upgraded considering the venue's image.Drinks : Khatta Pudina & No Daaru Cosmopolitan were ok but Mint Mojito was unbalanced.Service : FairThe place might be good if someone wants to have drinks & fritters. Food is very local.Ratings only for the ambience."
2489,Good food and environment. Service needs to be polished and quicker. But worth visiting atleast once. Nicr place to hangout with your date and enjoy the privacy.
2490,Surprises you with a place you wouldn't expect just around the block. Sure go to Mani when you want to be served well and have a good time. Much recommend you guys on a funday Sunday. 
2491,"Food: 4/5Ambiance: 5/5Music: 3/5Service: 4/5A well spaced restro-bar in cp. Ordered sangria, veg Mediterranean platter, Alfredo mushroom pasta. Sangria was good but they didn't have any fruits to be infused other than green apple. Veg Mediterranean platter was good especially pita bread and hummus was really amazing. Mushroom Alfredo pasta was fine. Worth going, lil over pocket place for students but worthy enough."
2492,Kunal ghosh amazing man! Wonderful service. Food and alcohol were too good. Loved services and friendly environment. Worth every single penny.
2493,Local is being great for and the music always amazing . I always love the most It is third visit in local and it‚Äôs great greet for me .. Maniram provides good services in local 
2494,"Hey Munchkins, Today‚Äôs review is of Local in CP and to start with Local is a large property with nice ambience and is great for parties. If we talk about food I will definitely say that it‚Äôs quite average in taste having beautiful presentation and I am strictly talking about the dishes I ordered. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Dishes ordered:- 1) Drums of heaven - 3/52) Chicken shawarma pockets - 2/5 (the pockets were really dry) 3) Makhan wali Pav bhaji - 3/5 4) Asli Mango shake - 2.5/5 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Overall Ratings Ambience- 4/5Food - 3/5Service - 4/5~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~NOTE: Avoid going in the day, the real vibe of it can be felt after the...read more"
2495,Wha8 I like about this place was it was not so crowded and we get place of our choice. Music and ambiance was good and one can spend quality time with close ones. They offer good food with great taste and quick service which makes it more appealing and force to visit again.
2496,"A perfect place for small as well as big gathering.Went for a Halloween party,it was property lit according to the theme.Food was enough mouth watering .Must try- the 6inch burger ‚ô•Ô∏è"
2497,Best place in c.p for hangout we came there last Friday with my friends fully enjoyed this place food was very nice and also prentetion and qwick service and drinks was good overall good experience thnks ...team we will visit soon..
2498,"This place never disappoints me!! Be it a weekday or a weekend, it‚Äôs always fun to be there. Weekends it‚Äôs a little difficult to get yourself a table here but the wait is totally worth it!!! Must try their Aam Mojito üòçüòç"
2499,"I went there with one of my friend .The ambience was quite nice , the service was also good. We ordered the starters ,and I must say they were tasty .I would recommend, if you are looking for a combination of both great ambience and good food , this is the place "
2500,"Lovely ambience, spacious restaurant in the heart of CP,. Courteous staff. Sat for almost 3 hours and had fun time.Improvement needed in quality of food. The crumb fried chicken starter was chewy as leather and oily too.Was taken care by Nitin. Kudos to his hospitality.Cheers."
2501,It‚Äôs a big lounge where you won‚Äôt feel suffocated at all. Great ambience. The hookah was very good. Shakes were not that good. The food was great. It is a great option.
2502,I celebrated my birthday last year here. It's an amazing cafe with energetic music and quite well spread area. The best thing about this cafe is their space that does not make it feel crowded. They serve scrumptious food and costing is also decent enough as compared to other cafes in CP.
2503,This place is awesome to hangout..‚úåÔ∏èFood was delicious. ...wth great üéß d.j ...Ambience was cool...Overall experience was good .. bt staff are very rude and lazy ..
2504,"My friends wanted to grab a bite in CP, so we chose Local and it was our worst decision ever. Despite the fact Ambience and staff was good, the food was terrible.We started with tandoori fruit chaat which almost made me throw up because it was so salty, same was the case with their maggi, it had so much salt. We ordered pasta, chilli cheese toast and chilli paneer cigars which were decent but not suitable for the price we were paying. In desserts, we ordered a banoffee pie which was the only good thing! It was a terrible experience. Will never recommend it to anyone."
2505,"Good service by Dilip & Mansi , Delicious food , their Halloween theme decorations were amazingGood variety of dishes , Must visit if you are in Connaught Place "
2506,"Local, another property from the Best Fish.. Located in heart of Delhi i.e CP..This place delivers the best quality of food with an energetic and fabulous music..one of best place suited for parties as the place was jam-packed though has a contemporary Interior.Cming to food we orderedVeg PlatterChicken Tikka Masala PizzaMushroom AlfredoChocolate FantasyGol gapee and many other.No doubt the pizza was the best of all one must give a try to this. Everything was properly cooked and served well by the cooperative staff..Do visit this place super soon for an astonishing experience. These all pics were collected by me and my friend in last 6 weeks so have a look"
2507,"It's a good place, nice ambiance with variety in both the food and beverages menu but can improve the quality of the food. It's good but not extraordinary. In this age of competition, something extra must be offered."
2508,"Unfriendly staff. Bathrooms didn‚Äôt have water. We were served drinking water after a wait of 15 mins on a non busy Sunday afternoon.Food was decent. For drinks, half the things on the menu weren‚Äôt available. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend :/"
2509,"From the outside, the place looked upper crest. But, it actually turned pretty average and overpriced. A good place to hang out with friends as it's spacious but don't expect a dance floor. I had a good time, especially as the service was good.The Plus- Spacious and comfortable seating- MusicThe Minus- Taste and variety in menu- Pricing"
2510,"This place looks like a movie set. Ample of space and vintage vibes, it's picturesque. Presentation and taste is on point. They serve various cusinies hence people with varied tastes can enjoy this place too. All in all, perfect for party. Recommend for all."
2511,Local is one of my favourite places to eat out. It has a very expansive seating area along with contemporary interiors.Everything in food from the appetizers to the main course is scrumptious and the portion size is also sufficient. Staff is also very friendly and polite.Overall very lovely place to hang out.
2512,"Very nice place, awesome ambience... Good to hang out with friends with some good food & drinks. One should visit this place for an awesome environment... Dilip was really helpful with services.."
2513,Food and service was great..great ambience..Dilip provided the great service...visited with friends..we all had a wonderful time..I would really recommend this place
2514,"The ambience is really good.With the wooden/bamboo theme and the large lcd screen.I really loved the arrangement.Coming to the food, I will say the food was really fast and it's delicious.Though I thought at first it might be undercooked or precooked but still tasted good, so no complaints.We had ordered a non veg Chicken platter, a pizza, veg salt and pepper (this was really the stand out dish of the evening), a tomato soup and peanut masala.Coming to drinks well we didn't like it.The beer was good but we had a cocktail which was just apple juice with literally no content of alcohol, and then tequila short (pathetic) I will say.I was not satisfied with the drinks they served.So...read more"

2518,"A Pretty nice place if you are lookin to party in CP. The property is huge & divided into two floors. Well stocked bar and kinda vintage decor The menu gives a great localized vibe. Everything they are offering is very Indianized. what I had and can vouch for:- Pav Bhaji - Great taste. Flavours on point.- Keema Pav - üíØ. Need I say more?- Butter Chicken Tikka - Spicy and well marinated succulent pieces of chicken were tender on point.- Fish Fingers - Not at all oily. Much better than what was expected.All in all, this is a great place with good food and nice music. Shall visit again."
2519,"The service was very good. The food is amazing. We ordered chicken platter, dahi kabab, Pav bhaji, nachos and much more. Thank you Deep for providing us the best offers on our bill and for the great service :) "

2527,The ambience was quiet good Food and drink is too awesome Nd music is to quiet but easily to talk with each other Our server Komal is too good who attend us very well
2528,"Love the ambience of the place. About the food‚Äî the Tomato Soup was difficult to differentiate if it was Soup or the red sauce of pasta. The Dahi in Veg Dahi k Kebab tasted sour, looked like it was stale. Another thing that disappointed me was, there was no hot beverage on the menu when I asked about it from the waiter as I intended to order some hot beverage which is why I had to order Soup instead.Also, the behaviour of the staff their could get better as we had to look out for them every time to order and they were not near by."
2529,Local have difference in prices shown on zomato and actual at restaurant. I am attaching the bill for proof. What they have shown is different in actual . You can check the Absolute vodka prices & compare it with the zomato menu you will find the difference.

2539,Local is one of the best property in Connaught Place if yoy are looking for places to party. It is a really big place and the ambience of this place is really lit. Their bar boasts some really good drinks in their menu and their cocktails are amazing. The food is also delicious amd they have a multitufe of dishes from different cuisines. I specially liked their Chilli Cheese Toast and Pizzas. Nice place. üëçüèª

2550,Food was very nice and the ambience is superb. Drinks are amazing and the service of Mr. Dev and Satpal is wonderful. Impressed with the hospitality.
2551,"Been here twice. I absolutely love the ambience of this place. One could go on a date or with friends it will suit to all. However, the food is pricey and in mocktail, they have limited options all of which are very average in taste. I love their mutton seekh kabab. Have always ordered their non-veg platter which is enough for two."
2552,"It was my friend's birthday so we decided to go to a fancy place and we chose Local CP.The ambience and the decor is amazing. The kind of marbling pattern at the entrance particularly caught my eye. And we started off with mocktails, I had the pineapple one which was okay and my friend had sukha anaar and he enjoyed it.Then we ordered or staple, white sauce pasta which was creamy and delicious. The chilli cheese toast here is also delicious! Their presentation of pav bhaji and gol gappas is particularly fascinating! Ended our day with banoffee pie which again was amazing! Will definitely visit again!"
2553,Nice place to sit in....Mr Viajy Kumar made the place more enjoyable with his services....A go to place.....Ambience is awesome keeping in mind the space they have
2554,"Local is a a great place and huge too. Yeah. This place is huge and has an eclectic vibes. The whole decor is very electrifying and the kind of music they play compelements the mood.The food here is a mix of various cuisines and it's tasty. I had Pav Bhaji, Maggi, Mezze Platter, Mutton Kebab and Tandoori Fruit Chaat. I loved each of the item. They also serve drinks which is equally refreshing."
2555,One of my favourite place to hangout in CPGood place to enjoy with good food and good ambience. The service is really great and Bollywood music is my favourite. Keep growing and spread happiness.
2556,"I visited this place with my friends , and i was very happy and satisfied with their services . 100% response from the staff and dazzling interiors, music is very good. You can enjoy with friends on drinks and food, and the innovative names of the dishes gonna impress you for sure. Worth going ! "
2557,Good food and awesome ambience and also cordial staff . tried their pan Asian food which was amazingSpecial thanks to Lalit for such cooperation and hospitality.
2558,"Amazing place to be with your love or friends, very good presentation and good music along with servicesI really like the ambience alot,their chahna platter and sangria is a must have#desilove#locallove#cp#"
2559,"First look of this place is very impressive as the center area is huge and sparse.There were lack of beer choices which I didnt like. Their menu lists so many options but there were so few in reality.In starters we ordered, chicken tikka and lebanese platter, both were very good. The pizza was very average.Also, the service was really bad. We had to call different server every time, no one was taking care of us dedicatedly."
2560,Decent place. A bit low on energy when it comes to being evaluated as a nightlife exclusive. The booze is okayish as well. However the food and the concept behind th3 naming of dishes and drinks did impress. If you are looking out for spacious pubs this would be the one for you. Amazing crowd must say. Worth a shot. 
2561,The ambience was adorable üòçüòç i've never seen place like dis in my whole entire life. Food was so perfect and delicious too. Many different types of beer available here like beer shakes and many other one. Overall a very happy experience was sushil shah. 
2562,"I just loved this place, ambience, sound everything was just wow.. I could not click pic as only stayed there for an hour and had momos as hukkah only .... ‚òπÔ∏è will soon be visiting and will upload pics for sure ‚úåÔ∏è"
2563,"Firstly, I loved the ambience of the bar and the music was good . They take a lot of time to prepare food and I got my drinks after 15 min of ordering .. Although my experience was good ."
2564,"Local is a local pub in CP with the usual dim lights, dazzling interiors, funky music and a cool vibe for an evening out. The service is good and the food is brilliant.We ordered pesto penne pasta, Mediterranean platter and sangria. All were amazingly delicious and very unexpectedly so. Many Italian restaurants get the pesto pasta wrong but this one was perfect. The platter was spectacular¬†with all the Mediterranean delicacies and dips. The tandoori tikka vegetarian platter was equally good. They managed to get three differrent cuisines right. Very impressive!Prices weren't too bad either, comparable to other CP bars.I would love to keep visiting this place."
2565,"Last week we visited that wonderfull place C.P. local. We were all very happy there. Food quality is delicious. Portion size is very good in the best prize. We tried to cocktails, the cocktails was amazing. Amazing ambience. Comfortable sitting area. Dj was amazing. Service staff was experience. Supper first service. They have talking very politely and they are moving all by eyes signal..............Keep it up "
2566,"The service is so appalling. They have a good location, decent ambiance but all this is marred by the service as no one wanted to take ownership of our food order/ drinks order. We were ordering so much but they didn't seem to care. Not recommended."
2567,"The ambience was really good , staffs are excellent and the food was also tasty but limited menu...üòïüòï They should add some more dishes for vegetarians..."
2568,Had a good time out there. I've tried spicy arabiaata pasta and its pasta sauce was really mouth melting. Totally recommendable .....Specially their dj night events . üëç‚ò∫Ô∏è
2569,"This place was picked up by my friend and it didn't disappoint me in anyway. Decor, lighting and seating arrangements were impressive. Menu is very descriptive and has the variety which i really liked. Drinks have interesting names which got me curious to try it all but i couldn't. Prices are on higher side. Service is very quick and staff is also very alert and attentive to their customers. Loved this place and would recommend you to try it. "
2570,"The food, ambience, the service by Mr. Vijay Kumar , everything is good. I would definitely come back to this place again if I just need to hangout! I tried Marshmallow Shake which is yummy! Overall satisfied "
2571,"Spacious sitting area, courteous staff. Portion size in offerings could be more. Good for hangouts with friends. DJ is centrally located in the sitting area which is quite amazing."

2573,"Few days back i again visited this place. This Place is completely amazing. Superb interior and decor and some live music is want people demand on a weekend. There's alot of improvement in their food.Previously i aint liked the food that much but this time it was completely perfect for me.I had honey chilly potatoes, meat balls, Thai cigar rolls, chilli cheese toasta, chole bhature, pav bhaji, Parathe, Kadai paneer, dal makhni, lacha paratha, banofie and choco brownie.No doubt the food was lip smacking. And the service was also fast. Completely loved this place. A big Thumbs Up."
2574,"CP da LOCALThis place is located at the heart of delhi CP which is already overloaded with Restro and Bars its always confusing so this time i took help of zomato ratings and decided to visit Local.I must say one of the most quirky and chic restro in the town after my dinning experience here i find it most happening place in CP i was blown away by the interiors grand decor and a lavish grub, huge place with catchy modern decor and retro lounge look.

Priced moderately with good choice of food and beverage- this place won't fail u. Quite the avg Delhi bar with EDM in the background, hookah smoke and dim lighting... 2 floors and a seperate smoke lounge gives ample seating options. What I liked was the valet option with text support as parking around Jan path could be quite a task... Order Pasta Aglio olio... Was pretty good... Nearing authenticity. Standard bee and a pizza that was regulation... Deserves 3.5 stars... Good place to visit in a group."

2639,"Went across entire Connaught Place to this lounge on a Monday evening after checking their zomato reviews and decsription. However to our surprise and disappointment we were denied entry saying no stags allowed.When asked about the reason or where is it written, the person at the entry door was rude and had no appropriate answer. He only said that this is the rule here. In case this is how it is, you guys should update this on your Zomato page in capitals so people do not waste their time and can instead visit a more customer friendly place!"
2640,"I went with my friends everything was superb great food,drinks and ambiance was also amazing. Problem was we ordered chilly potato but instead we got chilly paneer even after saying 10 times it wasn't replaced later we called the manager he was very nice and helpfull and he replaced our order"

Plz don't lie to your customers. 
2643,Everything was worst and it is not recommended by me on weekdays and staffs are not helpful at all. It was my second visit but it was pathetic.

Was quiet shocked and taken aback when I was denied entry to the Bar as they allowed couple entry only.¬†Dear Management,¬†Its a Sunday morning and if you are clearly not attracting more customers by such a treatment of tagging yourself as a couple's only Bar.¬†So all the singles please think twice before randomly bumping into this place."

We ordered pav bhaji, cheese loaded nachos , Alfredo pasta, masala fries, drinks- mint mojito, caramel chocolate shake, all of them tasted equally good but butter pav bhaji gets a brownie point for creative serving. Good for event parties , birthdays, gatherings. Light music with regal industrial theme gives you a better experience while having their delicacies. "
2723,"Local is a pretty spacious restaurant in CP it has nice ambiance and I truly loved their dance floor. We were in a group of 10 and had ordered variety of drinks and food.

Food was simply too good."

2728,Been to Local few days ago for a short bite as I had little time to spare. Grabbed a Southwestern chicken pizza which was not so delicious as it sounds but I appreciate its size though. The place is well lit but seemed kinda boring to me. The staffs were not so great in dealing with customers which I disliked the most. The ambience was good but again the same old dull crowd.
2729,Nice ambiance music and food as well. It was nice party we had here. Service is very nice I must say....Vijay Kumar provided nice service in everything. I recommend everyone should visit at least once here :)

They have a dance floor too for the enthusiasts.We had Panko chicken and traditional fish and chips. The food was great overall. Nice crispy chicken privided with its dips. The fish and chips wasnt traditional but the desi innovation was nice. The pan flavored sheesha and the last round of shot took us to a different level of high. Its definitely not cheap but its worth it.However, however i am disappointed with the quality of the whiskey they offered under 2+2 offer of Zomato gold. They were definitely diluted. Coz once we finished our quota of discounted booze there was a stark difference...read more"

2746,"Went to this place on a Sunday afternoon. Easily got a table for 5 people. Ambience is bar-like with big screens playing songs and cricket match clips. There's a VIP seating area which costs whopping Rs. 25000. No idea how special it is.. Food is average in taste, though names of drinks are quite special. Had paav bhaji, paratha, burger and veg lasagne. Paratha and paav bhaji were okayish in taste, lasagne was yummy. There was a cocktail bottle sharab di, which had nitrogen smoke coming out and looked quite appealing. For a group of 5 people, it costed Rs. 4000. All in all, okay experience..Ratings-Ambience- 4/5Environment- 4/5Taste- 3.5/5Service- 4/5Cost effective- 3.5/5"

We were about to leave the place but our waiter Mr Vijay Kumar was quiet good and was able to serve us better hence 2 stars. Overall I won‚Äôt visit this place again and it sucks because of the welcome.
2752,Because of staff service I wud give 3 star. U have to look around for the staff even when there are 4-5 customers..I wonder how they deal when the house is full :)..food quality is average..

It has ample space and the ambience is one of a kind. The staff is okayish. The service is fast. I had the pav bhaji which is the best pav bhaji I have ever had and I have had a lot of different types of bhajis.

This place is uniquely designed and a huge space is covered by the comfortable seating. They have Full Bar Available with some amazing drink options. They have a well maintained smoking room with comfortable seating. We really enjoyed their choice of music. The staff is really professional at their work. Mr. Sandeep has served us very well.

If you are looking for a place with subtle and soothing music and awesome ambiance, this is definitely a place you should try out. The food was surprisingly tasty with the right proportion of spices. We ordered their chicken tandoor platter and it was really one of their best. Asked the staff for their best pizza, n he made an effort to tell it to the chef and get us their best one. The staff is super alert and friendly. Will surely visit again. Highly recommended. "
2970,Good beer and cocktails. Very pocket friendly using Zomato Gold. Quick and prompt service. Rajesh and Sohan served us well. Will come again surely. 
2971,"horrible treatment by the doorman and the guy at the podium. To create the sense of excitement to go inside they will ill-treat you and reject your entry on a Saturday. Even if your table is confirmed they will make you wait.¬†The music is commercial and house, so those of you who want the dancing on bollywood or lyrical songs sorry you will have to wait till the midnight.The sheesha is horrible and so is the loud music , you cant talk here. The place is overpriced, certainly they dont pay enough fir the staff to be cordial yet."
2972,"Pathetic service , tasteless food , unfriendly staff , misguided menu as menu states different ingredients from the food being served . I wont come back that's for sure "

2975,"The service I experienced today was the worst ever in terms of food, and staff!!!The food served was not what the menu specified. For instance, the peanut butter and chocolate shake was supposed to have chocolate Icecream and there was no hint or trace of chocolate flavour instead vanilla being used and the sizzler specified spaghetti pasta instead of which we got rice and upon complaining they were justifying that this is what the menu provides until showing them what it actually reads, and instead getting a new dish of the same, they bring us the previous one with everything else burnt on the platter and the rice replaced with spaghetti in that too 20mins. 20 mins for a black burnt...read more"
2976,"A good place to hangout. The place is huge with a rustic ambience. The discussions console is in center and is unique for Connaught place. The food and drinks are good.

2980,"As I was in C P I thought to visit this place with my uncle.on reaching I found out that this place only welcomes couples ..irrespective if you get a pick up,on asking for a take away the rude staff wanted me and my uncle to sit beside the road and order our dinner,extremely rude staff ,with no business sence or manners..what hurts me is how they behave with the old ..shame on this establishment!!!! "
2981,"Local can be easily located in the connaught circle, this place is very huge, large seating capacity and lit ambiance. Generally crowded, the food served is fairly okay. The staff is courteous and service is good. Dishes we had :Cheesy nachos (2/5)Soya chaap tikka (4/5)Chicken tikka (3/5)"

2985,Beautiful ambiance...very spacious...good for dates... yea you can go with friends too.But highly disappointed... When asked for beer to serve. .its was out of stock or whatever.

2989,We went in a group of six. We witnessed bad food & quite inefficient staff. First floor seating is quite dark. The whole experience was quite bad that we had to leave much sooner than palnned.
2990,"A very good place to come If you are in the area. Been here three times now and everytime it has been a good experience. The ambience is great, the food is delicious and the drinks are on point as well. The hookah is worth trying as well."
2991,"Looking for a place with subtle music & awesome ambience so LOCAL is the place for you.Went there with office colleagues for some weekend party. They have some really good sitting arrangement.We ordered Chakna Platter, Himachali Tawa Chicken, Chilli Paneer Cigar & Murg Malai Tikka along with some beer. Apart from Murg Malai Tikka everything was pretty good.We ordered Chef Special One Sheesha too which was a little expensive but it tasted really good."

We ordered some veg items along with non-veg platter. 3 of us had the platter and today i got discharged from the hospital because of food poisoning. To my surprise, i got to know that all the 3 who had the platter are suffering badly from diarrhea and fever. Badly disappointed by the experience of suggesting and visiting this place, i really want to say that dont ever try this place."
2998,I must say that the ambience is pretty decent. Food quality and taste is great but only concern is with the portion(size)...Must try veg lasagne for veggie lover...#dev warm staff...

3010,"Although Local is famous for its street food , the items we ordered basis the recommendation of the staff at the place, wasnt very satisfactory...Nonetheless, highlight of the evening was Aloo Parantha - one plate leading to another and another.Lastly, the main course section needs to be worked on, quite tight for options to be explored."
3011,"This place has amazing ambience and has a great vibe! The Drums of Heaven were Yummy! My waiter was JP Yadav and he was extremely helpful.However, the experience was not as good as I expected it to be. Used Zomato Gold and that was a very easy and straightforward process. I faced a few issues with the Menu though. The Peanut Butter Shake mentioned chocolate ice cream in the Menu, so I thought it would be a unique combination and chose to try it out. Turns out that I was told that chocolate ice cream is a weird combination with Peanut Butter! The Menu description should be changed then. The Triple Cheese Italian Lasagna did not seem to have that much cheese in it at all. I feel that the...read more"

3014,Sorry to say but service is too slow. It takes almost 30mins for service person to get your repeat order and they are not aware of what is available in stock and what is not. We asked for Baileys and waited for 30 mins. Then by other persons we were told it‚Äôs not available sir and he is not aware of it 
3015,"You are bound to love this place. The music, vibe and ambience. It‚Äôs quiet a spacious place and you would love the whole set up.

Pricing is reasonable I felt for what they had to offer. I'm already looking forward to visiting the place again soon enough. It can definitely be counted amongst as one of the fun and happening places in CP. 
3024,Its a beautiful and huge place in the middle of cannaught place.The interiors are just mesmerizing. The staff is very welcoming and gets you seated quickly.Let us come to the food nowWe ordered paobhaji and veg pizza and both of the things were just superbPizza was very cheesy and tasted perfect because of a lot of toppingsPav Bhaji had the right flavours and we enjoyed it a lotOverall it was a very very nice experience and we loved it

3031,"Been here twice and I like the ambiance n crowd a lot. If you are looking for a place where u can catch up with friends and chat, this is a great cafe. They play fantastic music and is not too loud (which is why I like). We ordered Thin crust Margreta Pizza with Long Island Cocktail. Loved it! We have tried other stuff like veg platter and was not bad either. Overall good food and service. "
3032,"A spacious place with a great ambience, lighting and music. The staff was polite and service was quite  fast even though the place was crowded and fairly occupied. The food there adds to the over all experience. The pasta was completely out of the league and I would definitely recommend it to all. Cheesy nachos were quite decent. However the marshmallow shake I tried there was super icy and disappointing. But the staff was polite and got it changed for us.  If I recapitulate everything then my experience at this place was a positive one and I would recommend everyone to try it at least once. "
3033,Located just at the corner of the KG Marg entrance..Having 2 wide open floors a good place to hang out with anyone having a group of 2 or more...Place you enjoy having your personal space with a good dynamically low light ambience....Main theme is to gather all the local food and cuisine at one place...Must Try :- Pan Cosmo- Aam Moj√≠t√∂- Marshmallow Shake- Cold Coffee Shake- Delhi Green Park- Non Veg Platter- Ramladdu- Golgappe- Kulfi Faluda (My recommendation)
3034,"A great place with some out of this world delicious food.The cafe serves a variety of food and drink .Different variety like chai , pranthas , Pav bhaji etc .You won‚Äôt find anything better then it in cp . The area is huge so can be a perfect party place .Music was soothing and smooth . Service was class .The main thing attracts me is the quantity of everything I ordered was enough for minimum 2 .Pav bhaji , noodles and chakna platter are the must have here "
3035,"This huge pub with two floor one which is a Mezzanine floor and is just a amazing place. With DJ area placed in the center and the whole space in a square shape just gives the perfect party vibe on any day.Coming to the food i ordered their Pani Puri/ Gol Guppe which were served in 6 with two different types of pani served in shot glasses had a taste of both a bhel and a gol guppe.Secondly i had Non-Veg Tandoori Platter which had 4 types of dishes in it in pair of two, which were Fish Tikka and they were really good, Mutton Seekh kebab again tender and juicy, Chicken tikka and Chicken Mali tikka both very well marinated and spiced.

Overall the experience was great."
3039,"I've been waiting for so long to visit this place and recently I got a chance to go there with my friends. It's quite a big property with an uber cool interiors and ambience, i loved it a lot. This place has its own essence which makes me feel really comfortable and jolly. The food is pretty good, We tried out the Crispy Chicken Basket, this is my all time favourite dish so Inwas expecting it to be very yummy and the chef didn't ruined my expectations.

3041,This place is one of the classic places in CP with a perfect ambiance to spend time with friends. And the food is so delectable with affordable prices. I like to stick to the basics like loaded nachos and chicken bruschetta. But they amazed me with their special touch of flavor. Also the peri peri chicken pizza was delicious. The management takes complete care about 100% satisfaction of their customers tastes.Totally recommended. 
3042,"Local is on of the biggest cafes in cp. It has a huge sitting space. Went to have few drinks with friends.Ordered -Their famous CP Smash which is a must try because I literally loved it. One of the best cocktails I have ever tried..Other one was Neeli Sangria which had blue lagoon syrup and it tasted so good and smooth.Classic LIIT is another must try element.

3044,"By far the best property in DELHI/NCR according to me on various levels!! It is beautifully huge and spacious, very well organised interiors, i was just aww struck at the entrance, kudos just for that! The place has a sperate DJ corner, that is right in the middle on a fairly round place, so it caters all around equally, and the DJ box is super sexy! Service is prompt, washrooms are clean(had to mention it) , seats are super comfortable and you get hukkah too!! Coming to food, there are various food items that i ordered today, which includes: Gol Gappa Shots, which is okay(not so great); Drums of Heaven(Heaven indeed); Hummus & Pita Breads( Amazing, except the pickle); Penne Arrabiata(...read more"

3046,Jp yadav served wellFood was fine only n find somewhat expensiveGautam chef cooked fine only.i visited for the first time as i ordered kadhai paneer n chilli mushroom
3047,"Went to explore this place with a very dear friend of mine who was visiting Delhi for the first time. I must compliment the staff for being extremely courteous. This place has an apt amount of lighting to not make it look like a shady place and neither for it to become too bright at night. The food is good and their service is quick.We ordered two mocktails which weren't as good. Albeit the veg pasta here in white sauce is something you MUST MUST eat if you're a vegetarian and have a thing for pastas. While the portion is too small, the quality will not disappoint you, that's a given.They could do better on their veg momos.Too many picturesque corners and centres within the place to...read more"

3051,"Local located in Outer circle Cp, is a huge property with very nicely done interiors and a great sitting space, a property that everyone would enjoy visiting.Now coming to the food and drinks,We tried virgin mojito, a perfect refreshing drink to start with.Next we tried the fried chicken and ordered it twice, highly recommended.Their khatarnaak loaded nachos were perhaps one of the best fully loaded with cheese and salsa.A must visit place when in CP."
3052,"This place located in outer circle ‚≠ïÔ∏è of cp. Awesome place preferably visit here during evening or night time for better ambience experience. Nice place to hangout with friends and loved ones. All local and famous dishes of delhi is alvailable here with good and real taste. We ordered white sauce penne pasta, Aloo tikki nukkad vaali and in last Junoon ka fal everything was good in taste specially aloo tikki. Service was also very very fast and good"
3053,"What a b'ful evening it had been. To be honest, me and my friend went to MOB first but it was too noisy to bear, we asked them to lower the music but they refused straight away. I dont understand how people bear such noise when go out for relaxing and having a good time with your people. Anyway, we left that place and headed to Local and the reasons i love the place are:¬†1. Amazingly relaxing and straight out of a movie kind of ambience.2. What heavenly food for the taste buds.3. Great service and here i would tag , Mr. Satish for assisting us and suggesting us the best on the menu for that evening.4. Havn't tasted a better cocktail of drinks before.¬†¬†5.

3054,So my review is based on food n the environment there.Firstly there staff is very gud specially Mr.vijay Kumar was there in the afternoon thereAmbiance was nice also the food was nice there also this place was kids friendly like they enjoyed there 
3055,OMG!! I am in love with that restraunt. They are one of the best casunal dining restraunt among those restaurant .Three weeks before me and my friend ordered Kashmir kesar dahi ke kebabs and it is one of the best dishes I have ever eaten . and since then I am here every weekend with my same friend and Enjoy the weekend upto its fullest .
3056,I would really like it if you improve your lighting and seating a little bit. The sofas were really uncomfortable and lighting was not good for photographs. The food was overall great except the desserts. The desserts can be improved in terms of taste. The presentation of food was really nice though. 
3057,"It's Was Amazing Place For Hard Party With Frnds And Your Besties.Music Was Brilliant We Had Enjoyed Whole Party..Service,Food And Ambiance Was Also Great...Loving This PlayÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩÔøΩ"
3058,"The place welcomes you nicely and has a good ambience. The food is really expensive though and comes in very less quantity. Quality of food is okayish, I personally couldn't enjoy the taste because of the mere quantity. We ordered a non-veg tandoori platter, the platter couldn't justify itself. Then, we ordered a cheese margarita and a farmer pizza, both were okayish, not very delicious to give another shot to. Music needs to improve its genre and choice. Rather than making the aura noisy and loud, keep it surreal and nice with the genre like hip-hop or rock music or classic (80% people like it). Tbh, if you can spend a good amount of money and enjoy spacious pretty hangout place, can...read more"

Definitely visiting them again"
3060,"Spacious outlet, table seatings are too close to each other though. Nice vibes. Fun place to hangout. It can br really loud because of the noise of music and ac/fan. Food was good."
3061,"The ambience was great and the food was amazing. We ordered Veg and Non veg tandoori platters.Waiters were very courteous.The options for beer were limited, so that was a minus point. And avoid sitting on the upper floor as it dead as compared to the ground floor which is just amazing."
3062,"Local is the perfect place to dine in with friends and family, like this place has the perfect ambience that caters to everyone. Their menu is vast ranging from Indian to continental and mostly fusion of two. One thing I love the most about this place is the plating and cutlery used for service. The food and drinks don‚Äôt disappoint either. My personal recommendations for this place are the Fried Chicken, the Gol Gappe shots which is their signature dish I feel, the Drums of Heaven and the daaru ka chakhna haha. The ambience was the pure highlight of my visit here and I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a nice evening in CP. "
3063,Jp yadav is a very good person . Very nice person . Took personal care and suggested very good things . He has been very courteous . Very understanding. Took a video of us and was there at just a call away. Thank you JP. You are the best . Take care . And be there like u were for us .

3065,"Local is great place to visit with your friends and family. The ambience is lively and exquisite. The staff is also very courteous. Food and drinks were amazing. We had Veg Tandoori platter which included Paneer tikka, Soya chaap, Dahi kebab, Veg seekh and Pineapple chat. All these appetizers were very delectable. Peri Peri chicken pizza was full of spicy chicken chunks and was really very cheesy. The crust was also crisp and thin. Heavy drums of heaven were spicy and finger-licking good. Chicken was perfectly cooked. Marshmallow shake is a very unique item, not to be missed. Junoon Ka Fal is a Passion fruit and pineapple based mocktail which is rejuvenating. For dessert, we had Brownie...read more"

3067,"It was a cozy sunday afternoon we went to this place for a good experience. This new place was the talk of the hour. Even in afternoon was quite full. We ordered mediterran platter, chaap with flavoured wine. Portion size was enogh. Platter did justice to the taste buds. Something new i tried and was amazing Chaap was not the best ones i have tried. A glass of flavoured wine was just icing on the top.Service was slow and can be improved. Shall visit soon !!"

3070,Deciding which place to visit in CP might not be the easiest task but Local will never let you down. It's very spacious and DJ plays a good mix of songs. We tried several items -Non Veg Platter : consists of 4 items and each one is very deliciousChicken Biryani : Well cooked biryani which is accompanied by raita. It's very aromatic and delightfulCP Smash : A vodka based cocktail with green apple and elderflower.

I had ordered Aam Mojito (cocktail) which i found to be a little too sweet for my liking, so would recommend you to order something else. Ambience is pretty lively and relaxing at the same. What impressed me the most was the place having a smoking section, within its premises - where one can dine while smoking. Havent seen that in a long long time in any of the CP restaurants. Overall, a must visit. Atleast once.Cuisine - 4/5Food Presentation - 4.5/5Staff and Service - 4.5/5Ambience - 4.5/5"

3300,Wonderful place to hang out with your friends and family. Ambience is super cool and rousing. I had ordered pasta and fish chips that were absolutely finger-licking. I just feel that ‚ÄúLocal‚Äù should work on their cutlery too as the plate had a broken edge which was not presentable. üòä

3315,"Went there yesterday that was a Sunday Night, it was fully packed so we were seated upstairs. In beer they were only serving the ones which were a little pricey so we decided to order white rhino which was quite similar to budweiser. The food was a mood killer, chicken pizza was just plain tomatoes, chilli paneer should be called sugar coated paneer as it can be had later for dessert. Fish and chips were super greasy and oily, so much that a tissue won't be enough to soak up the oil from even one piece. Paneer tikka was just bland and had no flavour.All and all it was a disappointing experience to dine at this so called happening place but it just plain sucks! "
3316,There are limited option in delhi ncr which is serving breakfast too but the point was we could not reach there at the time of breakfast but not to be worry we went there at the time of lunch and tried their pizza and burger and momos and some indian starters food taste se is really good just need to some  change jn burger üçî it was just like some soggy rest every thing was perfect one more plus point of local that they have very good combo in alcohol like they are serving alcohol in single beer and in 4 beer and 8 beer üç∫.

3321,"Local is a fairly nice place with an amazing ambience. We went here on a Sunday & the place was extremely crowded. In terms of drinks, everything that we ordered was amazing expect Cosmopolitan. If you have some good experience with Cosmo, you'll find it to be much more diluted than normal. When it comes to the food, Loaded nachos & drums of heaven were delicious however the pizza was quite dry. The waiters were definitely not open to criticism when we tried to get Cosmo fixed. When it comes to money, you must come with large pocket as the rates are higher than a usual cafe. Overall, If you are looking for a good ambience & have good amounts of money, you should try it. However, if you...read more"
3322,"The staff here was extremely rude. Had to ask about a dozen times even for a glass of water. Then the waiter starting fighting and the manager just kept on looking.In an area where we have such amazing restaurants, with great service, 'Local' is a disappointment.When deciding which place to go in CP, you can blindly cross out Local.

With good music playing and a large seating space the ambience was great.They have a great menu both with fancy names and a great variety. The food was presented well but had a scope for improvement. All the dishes ordered were up to the mark in quantity and flavours. The cheese sauce penne being my personal fav for the lot. The thela chowmien had that desi touch it should have and the nachos were loaded with a good amount of topping. The pizza was good but the crust could be improved.The north indian gravies very lacking spice...read more"

3400,"Firstly at 7pm they say , stags are not allowed and I was actually going with a Korean partner for a business meeting cum dinner , but anyways they let us in and asked us to sit on the first floor to save them from the embarrassment of having 2 guys coming to their restaurant for dinner . The manager on the desk outside was pretty rude . Keeping the behaviours aside , I ordered for mojitos which tasted like fresh lime water with some sugar and ofcourse a bit of rum , not like a classic Mojito , the chilly fried mushrooms were kind of over cooked , the margherita pizza was the best out of the food I had ordered which was quite average . "

It was having whiskey,lime juice, apricot jam, orange juice and mint leaves. You can give this cocktail a try!I was highly disappointed by the food here. The menu is average priced but the quantity per dish is too less for anyone.We ordered a lot of food but were not at all satisfied by the quality or the quantity of the food. So in my opinion if you are a teetotaler, there are better places to visit in CP for you."

Mix it with great music and ambience and you are set for the night. A sincere thanks to Mr. Vijay Kumar, who served us throughout the evening without any hiccups. Looking forward to another party.

3459,I loved the food and the service. Try the chilly chicken and the peri peri pizza here with a couple of drinks and make sure Lalit serves you. He‚Äôs polite and considerate just like the other waiters here. 5 star is kind of less. A chill evening pending? Don‚Äôt go posh. Go #LOCAL or go home. 
3460,"Had my friends night out at this place and my experience was unpleasant.To be honest, dimsums were excellent and the pasta pizza were pretty decent enough. Service was quick.Coming to the worst part, me and my friends had to go down for a while and we informed the staffs to have a check that our plates and food aren't cleared. We returned back and to our vain our pasta was taken away and it was still CHARGED IN THE BILL.And now coming to zomato gold, we showed our zomato check in code and they disapproved saying we guys checked in 10 mins before showing them the code.Food and ambience was good but the Staffs needs to be improvement. Please don't CHARGE FOR THE FOOD THAT YOU GUYS...read more"
3461,Jp yadav nice services very tasty food mostly paneer tikka and celebrating my brthdy ..amazing experience lovely service yummy I just love it........ want 2 come again...
3462,Security booth at the entrance is what caught my eye at the entrance. The ambiance is pretty huge with a VIP area as well. There are a lot of screens which are visible from every angle and any seat you take. This place is perfect for sports screening. The food is good but not a lot in quantity. Smoking area is bigger than most of the places and very well ventilated. All in all a good experience and you may want to visit again and again as I did.
3463,Nothing very special. It is more of a massy destination. Food is average so is ambiance. It is only worth going for crowd. I'll personally not recommend it 
3464,Food was quite good & The ambience was good too & the waiter and people there were humble and Sweet. Great services by (Sohan) We'll surely look it to visit again.

3467,Ambience was really great with a very curtious staff  little disappointed with the choice of beer selection as menu is quite vast but only had few available to select from price is quite reasonable didt tried much from the menu for food but French fries were really well done presentation is good taste can be improved with little more detailing on the cooking and selection of ingredients as I also tried the dahi ke kebab which were little under cooked and a little extra sweet for service 4 star for food 3 will surely visit again soon though cheers until then .

I have visited multiple times and have tried pav bhaji, gol gappa shots, chowmeen, bhalla papri chaat, which all suited my taste buds. Being a total gol gappe lover, I would suggest to try it once. Vibrant place for party lovers."

3508,"Trying to be as polite and friendly in writing this review as possible given our experience today. Heard great things about this place but was highly disappointed with the service and food. The white sauce pasta and salt and pepper we ordered were extremely bland. Telling the server the same didn't help. The cold coffee was not cold. Thanks for agreeing to that and serving it cold later. And mineral water here is overpriced. If customers have to mandatorily pay service charge, request you to at least make us feel that you deserve it. 1 star for the cold coffee. "

3585,"Location is good, on the edge of the outer circle of CP... The food was ohkayish...The service was fine...The ambience is really good...But the issue is the service charge which they are charging on the food items as well when the government has clearly specified that only GST needs to be paid on food items..Add to that the manager was really stubborn...Doing something illegal with such great boldness requires guts...Guys do not pay the service charge as it is illegal.."
3586,"Well I didn‚Äôt like much this place as like I have heard from people,,, Food 3 out of 5Service 4 out of 5Ambiance 3 out of 5This place was good before but this time I didn‚Äôt feel the same,, service good and what I like in the ambiance is the centre DJ counter rest nothing much good about this menu place."

3623,A good place to hang out and relax... Not too loud musical and quite spacious. The servers are very polite. The food & it's presentation is also good.

3654,"So I went with a group of friends and were seated in the couch section but when a waiter named SANDIP came to take our order, he asked us to sit in the normal seats. We politely informed him that the MANAGER herself had offered us the couches.As we all had Zomato Gold subscription, when we showed the coupon to the waiter before placing our order, SANDIP severely judged us and started mocking us and laughing on us. We all saw but ignored this time as well.As we had multiple Zomato Gold subscriptions, when we wanted to place another order, SANDIP refused to take our order as he wanted us to login before his eyes and show our accounts to him. That was it. We asked for manager to resolve...read more"
3655,"The food was goodThe ambience was good tooEvery dish there which I ate there was having a good , tempting smell and tasteThe surroundings were comfortableIt's a place for friends to take ...not little family placeThe waiter and the people there were humble and sweetEverthing there was up to the mark and yup we'll surely look to visit again"
3656,"Definitely worth a visit. Love how the dj is the center of attraction, it makes the place so much more happening. Lovely music and food and do not miss out Vape. Cooperative and friendly staff! "
3657,I actually like this place for a weekend evening hangout. Been here two times and enjoyed both of them. The music is good & the place is very spacious.
3658,"We had asked for beer as per deal, the manager Mr. Vishal told that there is no availability of beer, he told us to place an order for IMFL. When we took place an order for IMFL, they informed Soda is chargeable. Then we place an order for starters, so he told this item isn't available in our menu. The manager behaviour was ridiculous. He was so arrogant and not in mood to give any services. He told to refund this deal and place Ala - cart order. He only welcomed Ala-Cart order. Food was also bad. Bad experience of local. Never suggest to any person to visit the same."
3659,Food and ambiance are very good..behaviour was very good and very friendly staf..specially JP yadav..food was very good..music and everything was very delightful..must try..
3660,"It was my first visit to any restro bar in Delhi,It's location is really nice as in the heart of the capital.When we entered through the doorway, the first thing was I saw that was the DJ area with 4 wide screens in the middle of the bar.The whole place is well decorated with typically Delhi style from water serving glass to walls on which some of the Delhi's famous monuments sketches hanging.Staff is really nice and professional.Now for the food, food is also good. We had spring roll, veg loaded pizza and chicken tikka.Overall experience if you are looking for some serene place in the daytime, Local is the right place."
3661,"Been there twice,its perfect (have no idea about food though, as I'm a vegetarian, tried veg platter and it was tastelessüòÅüòÅ). Its spacious with perfect ambience. They do have variety of drinks to try. The staffs are great and polite.  "
3662,Went there to have decent time. J P Yadav is a great server there. Enjoyed the ambience and food and definitely music. Will definitely come back next week.
3663,"I have been to Local thrice now. The first two visits were exquisite and perfect. Reason being, it was new. The staff was very courteous, friendly and quick. But to my horror, this time, everything was completely screwed up.The primary aim of local has become to ""earn money"" without any customer satisfaction. They charge 1500 rs cover entry charge per person now on entry and once you pay 1500 bucks, they do not care who you are and why you came here. The managers inside told us to find the table ourselves, there was no single point of contact and they were very partial. It was jam packed and hence we have to find table ourselves, track waiter ourselves. Their is no proper...read more"
3664,"Been visiting this place for quite some time now, has a good ambience. A place that definitely brings you back for more. Our server Sandeep was a great help in recommendations in terms of both food and drinks. Food: 4/5 Experience: 4/5 Drinks: 4/5 Definitely recommend it! "

3668,Ambience is wow.Staff is humble and honest .Decor is eye capturing.Presentation is good .Food was delicious undoubtedly.Must visit. Amazing place to hangout at and with the sensible And soothing music . 
3669,"It was a very interesting experience, like a breath of fresh air in Delhi.The place is pleasant and trendy.The staff is very nice and professional.The food is really tasty.The dj booth in the center and the music are very nice."
3670,Ambiance is top notch no doubt on that. But apart from that from the food they offer to the alcohol they have & many things were just a let down for me.I was expecting way too much from this place maybe. But there are many better options nearby.
3671,One of the only places who play commentary on audio system while telecasting football matches. I come here to see live football word cup knock out matches. Excellent service by Deep the server.
3672,I love the interior and it is very spacious with ample sitting. Food is also good specially the paneer tikkaüòâüòâ.  A good spot for parties right in the centre of the city.
3673,"Ambience and location is great.But very less vegetarian eating options. That breaks my heart. Hookah was not great. Pizza was ok. Nachos were good, but not a big deal to serve good nachos plate. A bit over rated n pricy. "
3674,Really nice place to chill ! The ambience was awesome .Its huge firstly .Because if the football world cup the place was decorated and had huge tv sets everywhere so everyone could watch the match !The staff was very nice and polite .We ordered LITs and this green drink which were both very delicious .To eat we ordered cheese nachos and hummus with pita bread . The hummus was good . The pita bread was more like a kulcha ! HahaBut i would really like to come here again and try more stuff !
3675,"Nicely decorated place to hop in. Food is good, but servicing is not pleasing. Ample seating area and good ambience. Didn't had good time with the music.I'd recommend it to be a one time visit cafe.Thanks"
3676,A football fan seing the beautiful game on 3 screens. Amazing this place is!The south western pizza accompanied with beers and shots was an icing on the cake. It tasted as good as Griezman's goal against Uruguay!Cheers and do visit this place.
3677,Nice restrobar with all the drinks available. Service provided by Mr. Pravesh was very good. Thank you guys!!!Must visit this place with Friends. 
3678,"Nice place to hangout with friends. Music is too loud to talk but if you are in a mood to dance, it's a nice place. To add on, Jitendra is a nice guy."
3679,What best time to vist when the FIFA Fever is on.Had great time even just sitting and watching the game itself. Seeing people with same fervour and enthusiasm just added much more fun. Food was upto tye mark. Tasted one of the beat Thin crust pizza ever here..Just felt that the place need a bit more addition to the staff list to cater all the Localites adequately..Loved the Experience and the Ambience.. Lightning yet subtle. Cheersss!!!!
3680,"After hearing a lot about this cafe, we finally visited them. The cafe is huge and the ambience is great too. We tried their nachos, dal makini with naan and honey chilly potatoes. The nachos were yummy. Honey chilly potatoes were crisp and delectable. Dal makini was ok."
3681,"Local, CP the place was huge only 30 percent tables are occupied during evening time. The ambience was nice. Coming to the food the taste is ok-ok. That's why I rated them 3 star only. I tried chicken wings, kathi roll, coffee caramel shake, veg salt and pepper and many more items."
3682,The service here is pretty good and perfect for people looking for some beats.The beer is served chill and waiters are awesome .Although you could mingle with some Punjabi
3683,It had a great enviously n great food but the missing element was the name itself says LOCAL n there were no local songs even after demand of the birthday girl So this is big drawback that no local songs only english songs in a place which suggests about local india 
3684,Not a good place. Had to call the police to get entry because apparently for them the girl to boy ratio was not appropriate. Post the police visit they realized that they had to tell sorry because one friend was disabled and according to them ‚Äúlangda hai kapde theek nahi hai‚Äù this was the reply of the bouncer. This is not a recent incident but I still thought about bringing this to everybody‚Äôs notice :) 
3685,Another addition to sports bar with local look. Food Menu has localised food options. Bar menu serves all varieties. Overall experience is good. When it gets crowded delivery gets delayed 
3686,"I celebrated my birthday over here with 10 of my friends and I swear it was perfect. This place has an amazing ambience with perfect lighting and extremely comfortable seats. I ordered a lot of chicken starters and they were up to the mark. Also, in veg, paneer tikka and chilly potatoes with shakes are my favourites. The food is served with good decoration and really fast. Prices are not that high, and services are amazing. Staff is really helping and cooperative.I am going to this place AGAIN soon. Will you, aswell? "
3687,"The place was amazing.. went there today, ie, Wednesday night, still had so much fun..And if you want best service, ask for Satish and Satpal, these 2 guys are very humble and always ready to serve.. they brought are orders hot and ready to heat..We really had fun because of the DJ and the staff.!!"

Ambience  of the place is too goodüëçüèº.Staff is also courteous , and serving our order on time.Let‚Äôs talk about food, varieties of pizzas are too good, lasagne is mind blowing, but Pastas are not that good.

3698,Parvesh Bouddh is very good and excellent.Nice service of food . Very impressive.Keep it upLocal you rock.Keep it upExcellent and cery tasty food.Nice expirience
3699,"The first thing that impressed me about this place is the huge space. The tables are spaced apart providing enogh breathing room and privacy for coversation. The choice of drinks is good but would be great if they had more beers in stock, especially in the lower range. The food is good. The music is good and picks up the pace with hour. It's a fun place for weekend evenings with friends. "
3700,"Been here this weekend after hearing so many good reviews. I loved how the entire place is made, it‚Äôs super spacious! Coming to the food, we loved the bhandari thela chowmein I think it was the best among the things we ordered. Chilly chicken was one of the best chilly chickens I‚Äôve ever tried! We also had loaded nachos and chilly potatoes which I did not like much, I think the nachos were over loaded with cheese which made them soggy. Loved the whole vibe of this place. "
3701,This stupendous kulfi falooda @local_cp was seriously a blessing ‚ù§‚ù§Its special part was in the beginning there was vanilla ice cream with strawberry flavouring and as you go down it relishes your taste with rabri and it has this sequence repeated twice! ‚ù§The quantity was fair enough for two or may be three! ‚ù§This is a must try at this restaurant bar ‚ù§Rating 4.8/5starsTHE GOL GAPPE SHOTS-THE LITTLE BOMBS ‚ù§Our aim is to try everything new and unique in the menu!

3703,"Amazing place. The food is great. The drinks are also good. The ambience and the service is also amazing. The place is a little hard to find, however following the google maps takes you to the right position. The mixed vodka shots they offer are cheap and taste amazing. Rest of the drinks are also not that expensive. Compared to something like a My Bar its cheaper quiter better service."
3704,Liked the ambience a lottt. The food was good. The staffs are courteous and helpful. The fifa live screening was on and the screen was better than other places in the area. Would like to visit again.
3705,Ambience and service both are good.Vipun and joshi served us with tasty food and amazing drinks.. i am specially in love with liit that they suggested.. it was amazing in taste.
3706,The ambience and sitting space is amazing if I compare it with other cafes in the same area. The service is also prompt with a good taste and quality of the food and drinks. They can improve the menu a bit but whatever they are serving is good. The music is also nice and I enjoyed my visit. Would like to go again for sure.

3708,"J p yadavService delivery was good , however food quality was not up to the mark....i heard lot about localz music but should also have bollywood music little more."
3709,"The size of the place in the heart of Delhi will blow you! Went there on a Saturday night and the pace picked up post 10 pm. I'd rate it as follows:1. Non veg mezze platter - 3.5/5. The dips were the highlight and pita was fresh.2. Alcohol - 2/5. Diluted, didn't work as expected :)3. Ambience - 3/5Would recommend to check out at least once. "
3710,Place is good with great food and elegant ambience but management really need to give training to staff. You have to ask for menu and staff will prefer to stand in group and pass their time rather serving their guest. Food : 3 Ambience : 5 Staff : 0 ( Big zero )

3735,"Local is one fine place to hangout with your friends in CP. The ambience and the aura it creates around for it‚Äôs customers is very amusing. We had mozzarella chilli cheese toast which was baked perfectly and was damn tasty.For beverages the Cosmopolitan is a must try item in the vast menu as it refreshes the mind with it‚Äôs balanced taste. All in all, Local CP brings in food from the streets of Delhi with a twist. They also master in fusion of International dishes with An Indian Twist. You‚Äôll definitely love the twists. The service was a bit slow but its a perfect party place. They all have great events throughout the week. The overall experience is joyful."

3738,"Local, CP has a pleasant ambience with plush seating and hippy atmosphere. The most amusing time to be there is in the evening or night when you will be greeted by nice music and proper nightlife feels.The food tasted good and the servings were not only artistically presented but also were in sizeable quantity. Everything we ordered from the platter to the plate of nachos was delicious and nicely cooked.The only down point I found was the service which was quite slow and seemed a little ignorant.Overall, it was a nice experience."

3746,It's everything that it claims to be. Nothing more. Nothing less. The music and drinks aren't too bad. Food should be ordered at one's own risk. 
3747,"JP Yadav Lucknowwale service was good! Knows the menu for recommendations...overall good time and service at Local. Plus anything extra, he's the man"

3751,"Convenient location, in the heart of Cp. it‚Äôs a must visit as the young crowd often visit here. Great service by J p yadav, made the visit worthwhile. Great music selection, good food choices, excellent ambience. Overall, super visit! "

3754,"Caught up with some friends for some nibbles this evening at this very popular bar in CP. I was off drinks so my main focus was food. To start things off, we requested for some vada pav, gol gappe and chicken steamed momos. My pick was the steamed momos. Really nice filling and expertly steamed. Went really well with the chilli garlic sauce on the side. The gol gappe were very well presented but fairly average in taste. For drinks I tried a pomegranate  sour (non alcoholic) which was nice and refreshing.We did not want to have anything in the mains so in the second round we requested for the chilli cheese toast and GT road chicken tikka. These were the ‚Äúsuperstars‚Äù of my evening and...read more"
3755,"I would like to recommend Local, not only because Zomato Gold gives you free perks but also because of their services. I would especially like to mention our server J.P.

3756,"This is one of my favourite place, Good Food, crowd is awesome, ambiance was too good.I would like to mention the plus point here: Good Staff and the Service was excellent ( Mr. Sohan served us really well )Great place for hangout with Friends.Thank you soo much for good service Mr. Sohanüñí"

3759,What a perfect place to party ..In love with the ambience nd the services they provideThe DJ and the lightening rockedMust visit place in delhi for party animals
3760,"This place had all my attention just because of its decor and ambience. It‚Äôs nicely located where nobody can miss to have a look on the establishment. But food is more important right so Dahi k kebabs were okaish and pasta was good. We had mango shots but they were again quite average. Want to visit this place again to try something new!Update: Mix sauce was yumm, no daru cosmo had a different taste it reminded me of kala khatta gola, pizza had good flavours and hakka noodles also had excellent taste."
3761,'Local' is best place for party .we are visit¬† with my friend. we have ordered some beer and starters . beer is fresh and starters decoration and serv style i¬† like it . service alsoo good and ambience very decent and star lvl. we are very enjoy at¬† this place.
3762,Visited today for lunch with office colleagues and not satisfied with the reviews and ratings given to this restaurent. They don't know how to treat customers and even in afternoon when the place is almost vacant. Waiters don't have manners theu even don't know how to talk with customers. Food is not even that good and personally feel like that this restaurent is overpriced and overhyped. Food menu is much confusing as it is not properly categorised for Veg & Non-Veg. Worst collection of mocktails I've ever seen on menu that too with the restaurent like this and that too located in the heart of Delhi. Overall bad experience and waste of money.
3763,"Absolutely rude staff , Couldnt even get a glass of water till 20 mins! If you‚Äôre a gold member and decide to go here; id suggest don‚Äôt! They will find every possible reason to deny the gold services."
3764,EXTREMELY rude staff. I was here to celebrate my birthday and they demeaned my friends. They need to learn how to talk to their customers. Basic etiquettes are missing from the training. Never coming back. 
3765,Pathetic service. The wings we ordered were super super oily and when I complained about it the server was damn rude. Served me the wrong drink and then denied about the same.And pizza was stale 
3766,"My rating based on my Visit of 30th may. Food was nice, ambiance was nice, staff behaviour was good. Food serving dish portion size was also appropriate. A recommended place in cp. One thing i would like to add local team that is Bollywood Songs. Else my overall experience was nice. Thanks team."
3767,"I visited this place last saturday, without prior reservation, place looked good at first with football world cup matches live on few big screens. Overall nice atmosphere, except that they have very few beers available and the order taker seems least interested in listening to you, told us about few available beers and wanted us to be quick to choose and to order a litre, even if we didnt want that. He forgot to place order for one person and later after serving others he realised and asked to wait for more to get the order, with no courtesies at all. Service standards seems extremely poor, with so many better options available in CP I will prefer not to revisit."
3768,"This place is massive and astonishing. The ambience is very chilly. They have 2 different sitting arrangements. The DJ is good, one of the best part of this restaurant. The staff is very friendly and polite but manager should learn how to talk with the guest They have a variety of food and drink options. If you want to hang out with your friends this is the place for you. Highly recommended place must visit."
3769,"Food ordered: pav bhaji + drinksQuantity: More than enough for 1 personAmbience: Very beautiful ambience where one would like to sit back for hoursTaste: The presentation of food and taste was really good, though it felt lil heavier on tummy later :-) (thanks to butter...). Servicing is fast too.Price: Decent pricing which shall not put a hole into your pockets"
3770,"This restaurant is situated in CP and is known for both North Indian and Continental cuisines.I was here a couple of weeks back along with my friends and we did have a good time. The ambiance of the place is quite lively. No complaints about the service. However I do feel that there is a scope of improvement in food.The must try's would be Crispy Honey Potatoes, Chicken Lollipop and Mozerella Cheese Toasts. The pizza's could be a bit better."
3771,We seriously had an awesome time thereüòç we really enjoyed the atmosphereüòç songs makes your feet not to stopüòÇ the food servicing and the quantity is goodüòäKudos Local and its teamüòä
3772,"The choice of beer was not there, Food was also below average.Pizza was not good at all. Chilli Potato was also average. I will never visit this place."
3773,The ambiance is so inviting and decorated very colorful. Excellent food and service. Good for party.*Good place to go out with friends also pocket friendly.
3774,"Super amazing ambience , its really a spacious club , I have seen after The flying saucer in Delhi .Service and quality of food is thumbs up .Bar has less options for beer , I mean they have it in menu only .Overall a very nice experience , specially Shouza shots ü•É"
3775,"Heard a lot about this place and finally gave it a shot.The ambience was great, very lively and amazing artwork on the walls.Went here for lunch so their service was very quick. Not sure about dinner time when there's a lot of rush.The staff was also very courteous.The food was good overall. A few dishes were really great while a few were average or pretty similar to what you have had before.Must haves-Chilli chicken dryLamb Pickled burger"
3776,"It's a nice place with dark ambiance and cozy feeling. The crowd is good, place is good and you can feel relaxed in the crowd. We just stopped for a drink and had a breezer... Nothing to eat so I won't comment on fir. Place felt a little pricey but the ambiance was good and felt like a nice place to chill out and catch up with friends."
3777,Nice ambience and place but poor service and DJ was pathetic. Had higher expectations and overall the experience was worst. Needs improvement.
3778,"Nice place, nice ambience, pathetic service and worse DJ.. expected more from the place.. the DJ actually managed to tone down the whole crowd.. apparently the only person enjoying the music was DJ herself..."
3779,Just want to say thanks to Lalit for being so nice and make are time memorable. Thank you Lalit.Local is one of the best place to hang out with friends.
3780,Amazing place for party lovers!!!!The menu offers a wide variety of mouth-watering starters. The chefs takes great care in selecting the best quality ingredients. Ambiance was really good. Its is a good place to visit with friends for party. definitely visit again.
3781,"I had a great time at local the restaurant has a great vibe, though the staff was a little slow over there also strange thing was they didn‚Äôt even ask us for the water we had to call them and ask for it. I ordered:Mozerella cheese toasts:4/5 (Had vegies loaded)Crispy honey chilli potatoes:5/5 (Very well prepared)Margherita pizza:3.5/5 (Had a lot of amount of oil in it and was not so cheesy!I loved the ambience of the whole place and when in CP it‚Äôs a definite try"
3782,"This place totally defining it's name. LOCAL=CHEAPThis place, food was actually local.Tasteless food.Even the water was hard and heavy.They even don't give you a drinkable water. You have to buy a water bottle.And it's very costly. And according to me don't pay a visit here, time waste, money waste.üëéüëé"
3783,"Open spaces! Spread out well and positioned perfectly as a pub and footballers den! Located at CP, the place is perfect for a hang out and a quick grab for a couple of beers! a top on ambience and service! On food, pizzas are really up to the mark and may be better! But they can still improve on their tandoori delightes! All in all I give 4 *"
3784,"The ambience is quite fancy and attractive. Loved the interiors and music. I liked the seating, for it was of various styles. Coming to the food, I just loved the taste. Food quality and quantity were really good and the place has a lot of space and not congested at all. And even service was also on point."
3785,Been to local a lot of times mostly SaturdaysIts huge when it comes to area and perfectly crafted as luxury speaks for itselfIts too pricey when it comes to food and liquor but the ambience and crowd comensates for the experienceHad some of the best parties thereFood is good not the bestDrinks are upto the markStaff is cortious but takes time as its a big placeOverall experience is good on weekdays and great on weekends
3786,Nice place. Good ambiance and decorated. Service was good. Nice crowd. Must visit at least once. Staff was polite. Happening place. Food is good specially chakna plater
3787,It's a good place... The food is amazing and staff is polite and hospitality is lovely... I have rated it four star and not five because they don't ask you for water when you sit on your table and serving water when the customers sit is their responsibility 
3788,"Staff was indifferent & lacked service industry courtesy.I, along with two friends, walked out.No one was concerned why we were leaving. The gate staff were busy humming songs or chatting with their friends.P.S. The staff didn't appear happy that we wanted to utilise Zomato GoldFive Reasons for 1 star rating 1. Service: Non-existent2. Beers: Only expensive beers available3. Zomato Gold: The staff member disappeared the moment I mentioned Zomato Gold4. Courtesy: Totally missing5. Professionality: Absolutely Zero"
3789,Went there for drinks on a Friday night. There was no waiting and we were seated instantly. We tried their chilli chicken and chicken lollipop as per the recommendation of the server. We were only two people so could not order more dishes.The food was good and I particularly liked their Chicken Lollipop. Chilli chicken was not that great and I have had better.Ambience was great and the music being played was not dull and keeping the place alive.The service was really really slow. It was painstaking to even grab the attention of the servers. That's why the low rating otherwise it can be a good place to have fun with your friends over drinks.
3790,"On Friday night, we visit local for the farewell of a friend. We ordered Local Chakhna platter, non veg Tandoori veg Mezze platter, cheese nachos, chilli chicken dry, veg Tandoori Platter, chef special, peri peri chicken pizza, farmer vegetable pizza, south western chicken pizza along with few drinks.I recommend to you to Non Veg platter, Cheese Bashir and Local chakhna platter for sure.Food was okay (4/5), service was slow(3/5), ambience was okay(5/5). Music was pretty loud (3/5). Drinks was okay (4/5), Value for money (3/5)Overall rating - 3.5/5"
3791,Worst service ever experienced by us. The waite was so ill-mannered i don't know why the hell he is here in local. He is truly a person who need to be in a low managed club not in this place. Totall irritated with there service. This place is not worth the price. Overrated shit.
3792,One of the worst bar to go in Delhi .Airconditioning is sucks and no service .Manager and waiters are rough and owner has no idea why he has put this place .Warm beer and badly placed screens to watch fifa World Cup. Bad for young girls 
3793,"What a big size place, awesome dj console. The screen around, good music and decent vibe makes you comfortable there. I went there with some of my friends on Friday and it was decently crowded. We wanted to have some beer and some nice cocktail. Most of the beer were not available that was the sad part. So we ordered some cocktails which are as follows1. Bottlan sharab diyan :- good presentation but not a great taste, for me it was a another lemony drink there was no apricot and orange flavours in it. I have got the taste of mint and lemon only.2. PUNJABI old fashion :- good drink but sweetness was the only concern for me. The flavours were nice bitters were giving rite balance to the...read more"
3794,"Located in CP just opposite barbeque nation, this palace can be spotted from a distance. Great place to chill with friends. I visited with a group of four people. It is pocket friendly and great on taste. The service time is quick and staff is courteous. Informal decor makes the ambience more relaxed and casual. They have interesting offers on food and drinks, at times!"
3795,"What an amazing place Local is...perfect to hangout with friends, enjoy an exciting nightlife with the full bar facility and amazing foods. The restaurant possesses a gargantuan space and the ambience is extremely vibrant and fascinating. A retro look in the interior offers a cosy, local vibe. Moreover, the courteous staffs and their hospitality increase the overall impression at very first outset. This place is amazing with intense lighting and excellent music tracks. Though, the music is too loud and this place isn't fit if you're looking for calm, soothing place."
3796,been there .. ambience was very good food was also good. i found it quite romantic üòç. i'll also suggest my friends to go there for some different experience 
3797,I don't know what is wrong with these cafes.. They closed the DJ on Saturday at 1240AM and asked us to leave immediately.Food was good but the overall experience was just okay. 
3798,"One of the worst place.- Music was so loud. No party songs, not a place where you can do parties- Service charge levied by the restaurant mandatorily though as per government provisions customers cannot be forced to pay service charge. If asked to get the same waive off, you will get a reply that its mentioned at the entry gate that service charge has to be paid- its a place only for those who wants hard drinks- cannot go there with family"
3799,"Had heard a lot about the place, so went with beasties,Ambience was nice..Ordered Lotus root freetie with Veg platter.. and beer.. but alas they didn't had Bira pints(that too on Sunday evening).... so had to settle down for another wheat beer.Coming to Food. Taste was great.. never thought Lotus root couldn't be made that tastier, Veg platter too was good.A nice place overall to enjoy a pint out ... "
3800,"I have visited this place twice or thrice, i just love it üòç.The place is spacious, one could easily get a table via zomato booking as well as when in queue. It depends on people how they look at  this place. For weekends this might be THE destination for you to party, because it has the best dance floor in comparison to the other cafe‚Äôs in cp, great playlists, delicious & tempting food, new flavors of cocktails and do not forget their sheesha.

3805,"This place being in heart of delhi has the advantage. It has a huge area and can accommodate more then 100, I guess so. But staff is not good. I went with my colleagues after a hectic meeting. They didn‚Äôt accepted Zomato gold offer, I don‚Äôt know why. Over all good and expensive place to hangout."
3806,The only thing noticeable  about this place is its sheer size. The tables in the middle are too small and each one of the 4 chairs of the table are strange and weirdly out of  place. Let's come to the food. I was accompanied with my friends and we ordered a veg and a non veg platter. The veg platter was decently 'OK' but the non veg platter quantity was nothing less than a bowl of chilli chicken. When we inquired about quantity the restaurant manager says you should have asked before you order. The attached image is their standard size. I mean seriously?! This they call is what industry standards are he even goes on to claim he's been in food industry for 10 years. Feel sorry for other...read more
3807,Nice ambience and good service. Their mezze platter and pasta were decent. Quite spacious and the music was just right for enjoying a little chit chat over food.
3808,"I went with my family to have a dinner in the restaurant. We ordered manchow soup , then drums of heaven in starters . In the main course we had butter naan and dal makhani. Also ordered virgin mojito . Each and everything was perfect. Drums of heaven were like heaven . A slight twist to your ordinary chicken lollipop, this chicken wings fried and tossed in schezwan sauce is a famous appetizer. The sauce make the chicken more succulent."

3810,Pathetic experience nd worst staff vehavior i never come back to this place GM is like illiterate very bad staff behavior nd they make u fool
3811,It is a nice place to chill out with ur friends. The food served there was really very tasty and delicious. The service was awesome. The ambience of the place was very nice along with the DJ placed in the centre was the main attraction. I really enjoyed the outing and food and drinks along with my friends and had a gala time.The presentation of the food was very nice.The DJ preferred only English songs but some hindi or punjabi songs should also be in the playlist.
3812,"I'm not here to write about my dining experience, but bring to light a very important issue that I have observed goes unnoticed by most of the people. Under the GST regime, service tax is illegal, and SERVICE CHARGE is NOT MANDATORY. Yes, the Government has laid out specific instructions for all restaurants and bars and etc to clearly state in their bill itself that service charge is completely the customer's choice to go ahead with. Yet, places like Local and more (cafe MRP. Its manager tried to threaten me into never entering again without agreeing to pay the service charge) try to exploit the lack of awareness on our parts by sneaking in an extra 10% of our bill.It could be more, at...read more"
3813,"The place is catchy from outside and inside, we ordered as usual my fav beer and drums of heaven along with the chakhna. The food was good and everything was going well, however one of the waiter started arguing with us on the fact that if we are availing zomato gold then they have to put all the beer on the table not one by one, moreover he refused to put it back in the fridge or whatever by stating that it will stay chilled for one hour (wat a nonsense). However later on I complained the same to some upper staff and the guy agreed to serve the drinks one by one( drinks were by glass not pints so it was impossible to replace). Food quality and quantity was really good and the place has a...read more"
3814,"Was here this Friday night. And let me tell you it was LIT! The music, ambiance, vibe, food everything was on point. Definitely coming back!"
3815,"I had masala soya chaap and southwestern chicken pizza. The food was good. The chaap had a good filling but was a little dry. The pizza, on the other hand, was good.We ordered iced tea and no daaru cosmopolitan on 2+2 drinks which weren't great at all. So it's suggested to avoid having that. Though it's written that they serve bira, it wasn't available there then.The ambience was very good though and good music was being played there. :)"
3816,"Drinks are loaded with good punch. I ordered local cocktails-- 1. Ghar ki bat 2. Local Green Park. In food, i didn't experimented much, i ordered french fries and veg tandoori platter.Overall ambience is good, if you are going on weekends go with prior bookings.For ambience: 3/5For food:3.5/5For service: 2/5"
3817,I liked the place for it's music and the ambiance. The place has a wide sitting area and servers are attentive. The DJ mainly plays techno which is good. Food quality and quantity are both superlative. I would love to go back again to this place ! :)
3818,Local was an average experience - when compared with other dine out places in CP. The ambience is great and the interiors have been crafted carefully. Food is average and is highly priced for its substance. They have a section of extremely expensive seats - the differentiation was hard to analyse. Service was sluggish and the menu had exaggerated descriptions for simple food.
3819,"PATHETIC hygein ...the drinking water that was served had mosquito larvae swimming in it... Thank fully we spotted it on time and left or else god knows wat would they have fed us... The place needs a serious check on food quality.. and on being confronted abt it the best the server said ""we will get u another and laughed about it"".. ppl be careful wat u eat or drink at local..."

3821,Best place to party with your friends. They have brilliant ambience and interior is even brilliant. Saturday nights are amazing here. Tried pizza and some cocktails here. They have amazing food.CP's best place for party. Try it. 
3822,nice ambience and friendly staff especially abhimanyuu ! he was so good with us and so professional which made me more friendly with this  place ... CHEERS FOR ABHIMANYU !
3823,This is one of my favorite place in Connaught Place. The ambiance is so inviting and decorated very colorful. Excellent food and service. Good for party.
3824,"The place is very well made and extremely spacious, don't get the feeling of cramped. One of things I would like to point out is portion size for Nachos! Small than the standard from most restaurants, which should ideally not be the case at such outlets. The food tastes great, All else is great, even the waiters are well behaved and courteous."
3825,The ambience is pretty much average. They didn't have half the beers listed in the menu. The chakna platter was decent enough. One member of the group had a mango shake which was good.
3826,"Seamless Gold experience. The cocktails were fairly basic compared to the interesting description on the menu.Loved the chicken platter! The service is prompt, and the music just about enough to enjoy a conversation. "
3827,This is a very nice place in cp.Cp is the central area of delhi.Most of the delhites went there on daily basis.This place is huge with 2 floors.Sitting arrangements are well managed.Ambience and sitting is lit.Food was okayish in taste.Staff was very nice in Hospitality.I hadCheesy nachos - 3.5Veg salt and pepper - 3Chicken wings basket - 3.5Peanut butter shake - 4Honey chilly crispy potato - 4.5Paneer tikka pizza - 4I rated all of them out of 5.You can try there food for hogging.
3828,"Local is relatively newbie in CP.The place is huge with 2 floor seating, with projectors for screening matches, etc. The ambience and the setting is the only thing that I liked about the this place. Everything else was meh and didn't excite me in the least.We visited on a Monday afternoon, and quite obviously the place was near empty.We got seated and got to ordering.We ordered Chilli Shots, Honey Chilli Potato, Penne Arrabitta pasta and loaded NachosChilli shots did not taste like booze at all and were a disappointment.Honey chilli potato were fine.Pasta was ok too.The food did not wow me by any means and given how empty the place was, the service was excruciatingly slow too.I...read more"
3829,"Never a disappointment...been there quite a few timesAmbience - 4.5/5Food- 4/5Staff- 4.5/5 We ordered Soya chaap, lamb kebabs and mutton goulati kebabs. Every dish was delicious and served very well."
3830,"It should be a go to place for its befitting the budget drinks. Ordering pint buckets you don't have to think twice about the money you are going to shell out. Isn't that coolüòâComing tp what was not cool - We ordered special pizza as recommended by the person who was serving us. The crust was made of puff pastry dough. As soon as we bit into it, it was a shock. Because with pizza you expect a pizza not a pizza substitute with hard crust.Topings were also dry. Maybe it was the crust that spoiled our mood.After this we couldn't risk ordering anything more in food. "
3831,"Good experience overall.The drinks were balanced and the food was delicious too.Not too pricey as compared to other places, will be back soon"
3832,"Good spacious place. Excellent service. Strongly recommended. Meet this guy called Shamim, he serves there. He is a gem.Overall, the place has a good vibe and they play peppy music. Perfect date place."
3833,"Nice place for a couple of drinks and snacks, and especially if you're looking to party. Food was ok, the chicken chilly definitely stood out. We had a couple of beers with peri peri chicken pizza. The beer selection could be better as most domestic draughts weren't available, neither did they serve bira. The dj was the highlight. "
3834,I have visited local for around 3-4 times and this place never disappoints me. The staff is courteous & its well managed. I love the ambience and mainly the DJ area which is exactly in the centre of this huge ring. The only thing which needs to be improved is food. Somewhere i think it lacks that perfect taste.¬†P.S Go on weekend if you want to shake your legs ;)
3835,Went there on a Saturday evening.. we ordered tandoori platter and fries with sangria and lit. The ambiance was superb and dj was playing amazing dance numbers... Liked the variety of sangrias they have.. A very good experience! 
3836,"Really liked the place.. The Ambience and the music was really nice.. Deducting a star because the drinks were a bit pricey for us.. Overall, had a great time though.. "
3837,The place has a superb ambiance and its lit by the evenings. Good place to hang out. We ordered red sauce spaghetti with garlic bread it was very good. Flavoury and had perfect blend of sauces. Then we order chicken steam dimsums. The taste ok dimsums was very okayish. You can find bttr on local stalls Last we had southwestern chicken pizza in thin crust. The pizza was pretty good it taste. The base had cruch and was good 
3838,Best thing about this place you are never asked to wait when rest of the resturant-bar have waiting time of 30-45 mins on Friday/ Saturday night.I have visited this place 2-3 times so far and liked their ambience and service.Food: 3Ambience: 4.5Service: 4.5
3839,"I had been looking to visit this place for a long time. Finally got a chance to visit here for some evening snacks. The place was huge and some 40 percent tables were occupied at around 5pm on Friday. The ambience was nice. The place was designed to give some nice night clubbing experience during late evenings. I shall update you all once I get to hit the dance floor there. Coming to the food; we ordered khurchan paneer Kathi roll, kashmiri kesar dahi ke kebab, coffee caramel shake and peanut butter shake. Kathi roll was awesome and the shakes were okay. I would like to try out their other dishes as well on my further visits. The staff attended us well.A must go place in CP."

3841,"Happening place in delhi. I went there twice and loved it. Very nice crowd, ambience.dj from vh1 is totally amazing.its jam packed on weeknds with entry of 3000 per couple but you can use this money inside. Apart from this food is also amazing."
3842,"#KrishtiKitchenFavouritePicksLocal, Connaught Place - Bahadur Thela Chowmein & Lahori Murg Malai Makkhaan Tikka Local is one of our top 10 places in Connaught Place now! We went there just while roaming around in the outer circle. The loud music and the ambience is so amazing, that you‚Äôll love the place the moment you enter. We tried their Bahadur Thela Chowmein & Lahori Murg Malai Makkhaan Tikka. First off, the Chowmein, OH MY GOD. That‚Äôs what our reaction was when we had it. It was mind boggling. The Lahori Murg Malai Makkhaan Tikka was really juice and creamy and full of flavours. Food - 4.5Ambience - 4Service - 4"
3843,"This place is huge and amazing. The ambince is very cool. They have 2 flood sitting arrangements. The DJ night Is one of the best part of this restaurant. The staff is very friendly and polite. They have a variety of food and drink options. If you want to hangout with your friends or celebrate a special occasion with your family and friends, this is the place for you. You can bring as many people you want as you'll never run of space here. Everything about the restaurant was A+. Highly recommend..."
3844,Came to local for a friend's birthday party. The place is amazing and so inviting. Music and beer are great here. Food is good but not great. Service is nice and attentive. I will come again.
3845,I went their on saturday with my freinds . Place is happening but i felt overcrowded so dats y service was lil slow we enjyed but it took 30 to 40 min fr single dish.but i like their starters more then main course.you guys can also try their food but be ready to wait.
3846,"I went to this place for the very first time. It is not as crowded as other places are at cp. I specifically liked their sitting arrangements on lower and upper floor, gives access to dj.All in all a great experience."
3847,"I visited this place on a wednesday evening hoping to end the day on a high note but I was disappointed . We asked for a couch but they were reluctant even though half of the place was empty. In the alcohol menu, only 3 out of 15 beers were available. I ordered bruschetta as it is a safe choice but that was also not good. "
3848,After reading a lot of reviews on Zomato I went there. I wanted to have some draught beer but most of the beers that I wanted to have weren't available and we had to order something that wasn't our first preference. Then we ordered bruchetaas which were not at all good. But the people serving us were kind enough to give honest reviews so that they can work and improve their service. 
3849,Local is another nice and great spot for dinner and party. A birthday celebration party I came here with a group of five people. Nice selection of drinks. recommend this place.
3850,"ambience is good. food is okay. but as you will visit the place seeing the fact that they serve draught beer towers or pitchers, soon you will realise that there aren't any.another thing, the will add service charge without asking you, as the services they are providing is already included in their prices."
3851,This bar is such an amazing place with good ambience and service. Perfect Combination of Awesome Music and Foodü§ó If one can get local menu in a wholesale bar what could be perfect üíï
3852,The music is good. The food is good. They only serve light beer though. Also not fairly lit. It felt a bit dark for me and due to this fact I could not enjoy my food which is amazing but still. A bit more lightning would help though.
3853,"The place serves good food. The presentation of the food is really great. You will get All local street food there, which mostly cafes and lounges don't do. Pao bhaji was really tasty and presentable. Ambience was fine. We got little issue in seating despite our prior booking. Overall the place is nice and must be visited once at least ."
3854,One of the best and oldes place in CP and trust me this place is amazing. It‚Äôs not crowded like others.This place serves good food and taste is also soothing. The place is good and ambience is also decent
3855,Very polite & attentive staff is the first thing i noticed about this place. I ordered a Mezze Platter which was served to perfection. Alcohol is slightly expensive here and the place could use some fairylights as it's a bit too dark.
3856,This place is huge.I went there for my birthday.Ambience is nice even food is good.But being so huge this place lost its charm for music dj n dance .Everybody gets scattered .But must visit once .
3857,"Went with a group of friends to try the very famous,Local.It's a place with a beautiful ambience yet darkly lit.Since it was a Monday,there was less of a rush, much to our relief.We ordered White Sauce Pasta and Paneer Piccante pizza.The white sauce pasta was really creamy and tasty. It had the right amount of veggies and pasta though we felt the quantity could be increased.The pizza was really delicious.The staff was really polite and hospitable.Overall, I would recommend it to my friends. A must visit cafe in CP. "
3858,"Went with a couple of friends on a Thursday night, ordered Classic LIT along with Veg Caesar Salad and Greek Salad. The food, drinks and especially the music was pretty good keeping in mind that it was a Thursday night we assumed that it wouldn‚Äôt be much happening but it came out to be more than we expected. It was Hip Hop night and DJ played some really nice tracks. Staff was courteous and friendly. Overall had a great experience and a fun night."
3859,"Pathetic service, zomato says no stage entry after 7 PM. Now the real story we reached 6.40 pm at the restaurant and got the shocking reply from manager you are not allowed to enter.My opinion don't visit this shit restaurant"
3860,"Ambience is good , you‚Äôll get to listen to some good music while enjoying ur food, however I was a a bit disappointed with the service , they need to be more quick with serving the dishes "
3861,"If you‚Äôre looking for a place to chill, eat, dance with your homies, especially in the late evenings, head to this place without a second thought. You‚Äôll get great service and hospitality by the staff. Plus, the place is so huge, you have no problems of parking, the music is so good you‚Äôll want to get out of that chair/couch. North Indian food, Chinese and Italian snacks- it‚Äôs all great! There‚Äôs seating even on the first floor, and the interiors are quite good. You‚Äôll not get tired of visiting this place again and again."
3862,Great ambience. Awesome music. Delicious food. Lovely service.I gave an extra star for it's music.Must visit for a groovy evening.Chakhna platter is worth a try üòÇ
3863,This place is so big yet difficult to get seats on weekends as It gets to busy. The music here is one of the best in the area. The food and drinks are on point as well. The staffs know their menu and always guide you to best dishes If you are confused on what to get
3864,"This place is huge and located in the heart of CP.The ambience is lively and specially the DJ nights. Coming to the food part, its also really niceI ordered couple of dishes such as Mix sauce penne pasta., Three types humnus with pita and Cheesy Nachos. Hummus was really good - i like all the three flavours. Cheesey Nachos and Pasta was also good.Their LIT is quite strong and hits you on the very first drink. Mojito had less content of alchol.I also tried their desserts Brownie fantasy which had brownie with whipped cream and vanilla ice cream. Dessert was also nice.Overall, a great experience at this place. "
3865,Love for loud music and want to sit and have fun with friends try this newly opened place in cp outer circle one of its kind in cp with 2 floors and having a lot of variety of food. Will cost 1200‚Çπ for 2 and that too in cp this is steal deal for such place. Must try this place but do note service take time a lot of time.
3866,"Very Dark ambiance. Quite difficult to get the table. For group of people you can get the table n g floor otherwise you have move to upstairs in a corner. Which is not worth. Bar menu is okay, not so much costly."
3867,This place is amazing and inviting as well very cool aroma. Seating is nice not communal table. Food is good and drinks are great. Service is nice and friendly. I will hit this spot again.
3868,"A great ambience bar!Nice place for couples and people in group.We ordered chicken tikka which is awesome and farmer vegetable pizza which is not good.Drinks price are little on higher side. But they have good sitting areas with big screen in the middle.The only complaint is about some good music and services. Most of the time, you have to wait for half an hour for a dish you order. Be careful about it."
3869,"Big space, nice ambience, the food is tasty, though the non alcoholic drinks are just ok kind... have a decent sitting space as per requirement. And to be noted the best seats bear the local logo is reserved for special guests so thats a big set back. "
3870,"We Thought of Giving Local A try after considering such a Good Zomato Reviews on a Thursday Night for a Birthday Celebration. It was one of the Non-peak Days. We sat on ground floor as guided by Manager. Sitting was not very comfortable. Even on Non busy Days Service was extremely Slow. We had to repedly call gor waiters to serve us properly. We had to kept on repeting our order request and Manager was too least bothered for Guest Satisfaction. Music was loud enough giving a good feel, that is how we wanted.

Still he siding allow us to sit downstairs even though there were hardly anyone sitting on the ground level .

3886,"The whole concept and ambience has a vibrant feel to it. The different seatings, screens and music add to the experience. All the food items have quite unique names and an Indian touch to them. We ordered khatarnaak loaded cheesy nachos, kashmere kesar dahi ke kebab and drums of heaven. Everything tasted good- 4/5Must try- local shots and desi cocktails. "
3887,"The name: LOCAL along with the tag line: A Wholesale Bar, pretty much sums up the entire place. The Ambience is top notch, the food is as good as it gets (the desserts especially are amazing) & the alcohol is well priced. The cocktails & mocktails are change from the regulars with some out of the box presentation. The food is very good indeed. The crispy chicken basket is a must try! In the desserts section the Choco Brownies with vanilla ice cream are an absolute delight!"
3888,I just loved the food. The location is very good and this place is quiet spacious and very well maintained. Service is very quick and staff is very friendly. It‚Äôs a place for every budget.

I tried No daru cosmopolitan, and cold coffee both were perfectly blend and prepared.Really recommend to all my friends."
3893,"I went with a group of friends on a weekday for dinner. We had chicken tikka, chilli chicken, paneer tikka and peanuts and beer. The food was okay. I was happy to see that they have desperados and hookah (which was the reason we picked local). But the music was too loud. We had met to catch up after a long time but could barely hear each other. It‚Äôs almost like a club. "
3894,"Local is a nice place to hangout, i went local last week and it was great to be there, all though it's quite costly but worthwhile. The drinks are awesome and loved the food there.Local is a nice place to be with your friends when you have mood to dance and enjoyüòçüòç"

Yesterday I visited this place with my friends in the evening . They have huge seating area . Plenty of space to choose comfortable seats .In the drinks I have Mango Shake .

3897,"This place is amazing. From food to ambience everything is just wow. I‚Äôve come here two times and planning to come here soon.

3901,"After trying quite sometime, I managed to be at this place and to my surprise it is not that great...... music is ver very loud here üò≤It‚Äôs difficult to communicate with your partner while spending time here.I believe it‚Äôs more or less like a pub, without the sight of people dancing though.If you want to have loud music for your ears and stay in dark with yourself or probably with your fone.... this is the place for you.For the food, I could only manage to have starters..... so the haryali paneer tikka is really delicous and Masala cheeze garlic bread was soggyyyy ü§î"
3902,"Ambience is good. Music is OK but loud as hell! Food not really up to the mark.... crowd is good... drinks are expensive ....however , always choose the Ground floor seating area it‚Äôs more airy , breezy next to the DJ and nice. First floor is big ‚Äòdingy‚Äô low ceiling like a mezzanine more than a 1st floors.Beer is cheap though! If you like beer go there.Please don‚Äôt forget to follow me ;) Thanks "

The drinks were smashing (CP smash,Bottlan sharab diyan and aam sangria) , food was yummy and seating comfortable. What made this place stand out was :- although the place was full, it was not too long of waiting period to be seated.- again, despite the place being full there was no dip in service which is a usual excuse for shabby service at too many well known places.- Presentation of drinks as well as food was innovative and thought of.I would highly recommend this place for a great night out with partner...read more"

I ordered for a chicken tikka, white sauce pasta, red white and a chicken biryani. This place is quite spacious and huge with an amazing dj. As to food I liked chicken tikka pasta was okay and I didn‚Äôt find chicken biryani good it does requires improvement as the chicken pieces in biryani were not cooked properly and that favour and aroma was missing. I ordered for a Jacobs creek red wine but it was out of stock which was kind of non satisfactory so I went for other wine namely seven something I...read more"

3939,The restaurant will not treat you well. If you go on a weekend be sure that you will not get the budget drinks and they will only serve the drinks which costs higher. #modeofearningmoney and even of you step out of it nobody would care for a feedback or reasons. #customerserviceshouldbegreat and the price will not matter

3946,"I visited this place today for the first time. Its quite big and nice but the staff try to fool you. We requested for beer and staff confirmed that they only have international beers which is certainly 3 times of normal price; however few mins later to catch hold of same guy serving domestic beer to other tables. When we questioned the staff and mgr, they apologised and told us we will compensate this... and we were given peanuts complimentory. This is shameful when people fool there customers and charge them 400% but when its there mistake they offer peanuts to customers. Not a proffessional place at all."

3961,Visited once again to local as my friend decided to through his treat there. The ambiance of this cafe is good as well as the music. They have dedicated the first floor for the people with kids. The ground floor Was full so they offer us a seating on first floor with lots of noises of kids.The food was strictly average and also the reason for this low rating.

3979,"One of the best place I have visited in cp. The place is quite spacious, so u can sit comfortably. The drinks and food, evrything was up to the mark. Wat I found best was their chakna platter as rarely anyone has this on their menu. Sometimes, u don‚Äôt wanna eat much but drink , so this is must for a pub to have in their menu!! "
3980,The ambience were good but the waiters were too lethargic and doesn‚Äôt even care to responsed.The food is decent but not worth the hype. The restrooms are untidy and very disappointing

I can say they can work on its preparations.Staff needs more awareness on how to focus on clients. It was so difficult of us to get our order place as no one was listening or giving attention."
3984,"I loved the decor and ambience of this place. The staff was also very polite and friendly. We ordered a lot of things, white sauce pasta and honey chili potatoes were really good. pizza and pan-fried noodles were okaish and chicken burrito was horrible. We also ordered a moctail and a KitKat shake which were both too sweet. The place is a little expensive too. The experience wasn't bad, but food and prices could have been better."

4007,"Lov d the place totally serving so many tasty dishes.Vada pav and gol gappa shots are the perfect for a chaat lover.Dahi ke kabab were properly baked and crispy as well.Do try there desi chowmein.. yeah thats the name the street style chowmein.Paneer tikka was okayish you may avoid as it was little less salty according to me.CARAMEL COFFEE SHAKE - something you cannot miss to have whenever you visit it.In mains, we had dal makhni paneer butter masala and favorite butter naan. ‚ô•Ô∏èChocolate cake is dessert was not that good as i like my cakes more spongy as it was.Do try there other Dessert options.Ambience is little dark one may prefer it if they want to have a pub feel."
4008,"The atmosphere was really great in this bar - despite it being a Monday night it was still relatively busy.  The Long Island Ice Tea was strong but pretty tasty, although they did take a while to arrive. The huge screens showing the cricket were not necessary as no one in the bar was watching but besides that a great night, with good music (if a little on the cheesy side) "
4009,Centrally located on outer circle. Location is great. Music can sometimes be too monotonous. Drinks are at par with other places i connought place area.
4010,Was at the place on a Friday night Place  looked pretty awesome and energetic Followed by even more energetic staff Specially this attendant TASHI went out of her way to make us comfortable 
4011,"Located near Barakhamba Metro Station,at a walking distance of hardly 7-10 minutes.Local,A Wholesale Bar is a great place to hangout with friends as well as family,the food,ambiance & service everything was amazing. Few things that I had from the menu was Gol Gappe(presentation was tremendous),Dahi Kabab,Farmers Pizza, Vada Pav & Paneer Tikka;according to me the pizza was less cheesy but it tasted well enough and Vada Pav was great to have.Moving on to drinks I had few like Mojito & Locals LIIT ; I would recommend to have order LIIT instead of any other drink cause it was a Strong mixture.In the end I had few slices of Dark Chocolate Cake; I found this Cake amazing because it was...read more"
4012,"huge space.. decently done for a cafe.. the dim lighting works well.. well priced too, not too expensive.. did not enjoy the food too much though. who puts broccoli and beans in a tomato minestrone?"
4013,"Decided to check out this place for lunch. Quite a huge seating area and even in the afternoon it was well lit inside. We tried the veg pizza and pan seared river sole. The pizza was pretty standard but the fish was outstanding! Perfectly cooked and the lemon butter sauce was heavenly. Possibly one of the best sauces I‚Äôve had in NCR. Literally ate the plate clean, this dish was THAT good. Keep it up, Local!Lime iced tea was, well, too limey, but it quite suited a hot sunny day. Wouldn‚Äôt mind a little less tang though next time. Overall a good experience. Would surely visit again."
4014,"Tasteless pathetic food.  Drinks  were also very bad.. There paprichaat was not worth.. After that there shakes, they added extra sugar and made them a sweetdish, brownie was not at all fresh.  Avoid going there people.. Dont waste your money"
4015,"The service is poor and so are the drinks!The food quantity is good but we talk about the taste ist average.They add egg whites in their cocktail, vegetarians beware!!"
4016,Service very poor.. nobody cared to take our order.. some of the items from our order were missed .. we had to remind them.. food dint taste good.. non veg was half cooked
4017,"Sad & disappointing policy even for Saturday afternoon 2.30pm they have stag policy , yet hungry for business they don't refuse you but cunningly offer you only mazennine floor which is deserted! Simply walked out and so glad, right across the road there are brilliant and friendly outlets!"
4018,Good place for finger food ü•ò . Nice music. very very visible location that results into parking chaos... must try place tip- try to be seated on ground if u want to enjoy the music 
4019,"Went to this place on a Sunday evening. I really liked how the place is set up. It wasn't much crowded when we went here, however the staff wasn't very responsive to our requests. We had to wait for at least 10 minutes to get ourselves a glass of water. The menu arrived after another 2-3 calls. By that time, i got really annoyed and didn't really want to eat here but since we were too hungry and go to another place and wait there another half an hour for food, we decided to order a Piccante pizza which was decent in its taste. Since this place is known for its gigs and looks more happening after 8(from what i read in other reviews), i'd suggest you go  then....read more"

4036,We had a chance to chill out at this place with office friends for drinks and snacks. The place is quite spacious and has a seating arrangement on ground and first floor. The service is quick and courteous. Portion size is also good. Bar is well stocked with ample choices. Overall a nice place to be in.

4042,"A nice hangout place.. food is ohsm.. i ordered keema pao and it was out of this world.. besides this, i ordered Aloo parantha.. wich had quite a good stuffing with apt taste.. overall a nice experience.. "
4043,"If you had a bad day at work then surely move to LOCAL. Oh my god i even not able to forget the ambience and service I received from such an ecstatic lounge . I don‚Äôt have words to explain the the quality of the lounge , everything was upto the expectation level. Food quality was such a finger licking and you will definitely gonna enjoy. "
4044,"Ambience was good, fully jam packed on saturday‚Äôs, service was too slow, food was also okish. I had to remind my order three times to finally served on my table i have been there couple of times but i never had this kind of experience before with me. "
4045,This place has nice ambience but unfortunately for me the good experience ends there. The staff were terrible; they blatantly ignored us and seemed so reluctant to take any of our orders (which was wierd).  The only reason a 2nd star was given was because the food arrived on time. The staff and service desperately needs to be worked on. 
4046,"local..but not local.. i need to say that staff was not friendly at all..the service was so slow..we have to remind them at least 3 times for our order..talking about food1. momos..taste delicious but the chutney was not good2.dalmakhni..was ok types3.garlic naan,,it was pathetic4.butter naan..ok types5.rabdi jalebi,,jalebi was crispy and good but the rabedi spoil the mood,the worst rabdi I ate ever.but The ambience was good.."
4047,"Come to Local few days back with friends and seated very promptly. Food wise, service wise, this place hit the spot. A nice gem in Connaught Place."
4048,"This place is love. Ambience vise i didnt find it any different. looking for a cordial staff -- ehh , not the right place. But take my word for TheBrownie. Its the best i have had so farr. Freshly baked or not but Definateky warmed thr right amount and dates and walnuts...its a bliss !!!! Must try. üòçü§©Pasta was as good as a normal cafe.Chicken tikka pizza acc to me you can skip if you wish.Drinks i didnt take bcoz after reading other peoples review , theres wasnt something that appealing to try. üòë"
4049,"Visited this place lately in delhi , beautifully lit ! Great ambience ...And food is too soothing to the taste buds!Services and staff people are appreciable too. The only disappointment was, that not all liquiors mentioned were available.. might be a bad day for me, but definitely a place a would love to visit again. Thanks for having us! "
4050,"Local, a great place with great ambience and food. I loved their LIIT.. it was fancy and tasted well. Must try their Vada Pao and chicken biryani. Must visit this place guys! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
4051,Visited this place on saturday much heard about it from friends holded high expectations but was disappointed.We odered veg platter which was good then momos which was pathetic just a lump of flour no filling even the sauces served with it were too sweet n o tasteAll our drinks were very sweet we asked for a change couple of tyms stl it tasted the sameWill never recommend anyone to order asli mangoo as no mango is there its just flavoured drinkSattu ka mattu was stl betterOn n all ambience is good but food will disappoint you
4052,"Ordered the Farmer Vegetable pizza, Penne Arabiatta pasta and the Local Santra shots. The pizza was nice, could have been better with a little more cheese and sauce. The pasta, however, was a bit too arabiatta with not enough bread servings to balance out the spice.The food is affordable though and each dish is enough to serve 2.Apart from the food, the ambience of the place is really cool, it has a very retro-techno vibe to it with super friendly staff to boost it all. "
4053,"This was my 3rd visit at local CP, I found the concept of keeping everything local n street names quite attractive..Good ambience, not over crowded, not very loud, nice theme and yummy food describes it well..I tried dere bahadur thela style noodles, Karigari biryani, kebabs and mojito..The noodles made me remember my school days as it tasted very much like thela noodles but a hygienic version üòú..Biryani was also good and kebabs were very soft and yummy..So, budget_travelling_sistas points are as follows ü§ó..Food- 4/5Ambience- 4.5/5Service- 4/5Price- 3.5/5 (When compared with the name and concept)Overall 16/20.. So a great one..Must visit lounge at CP..."
4054,"After hearing much about it from friends and colleagues, I went to this much hyped place on a Friday night. Despite all the prior reservations, we found it difficult to find a table for ourselves, because the place was over-crowded and flooding with people every minute. What I liked about the place was its music, while it turned out to be decent on food and drinks. So, if one is looking to get drunk and dance like there is no tomorrow, then this is the place else not."
4055,Good service and food. A real nice place to hang out with friends. Has a great live gig kinda environment which is very soothing and has ample plenty of space for parties. If you want to grab few drinks then this place is highly recommended as the rates are reasonable and the environment is nice. Would be coming back again surely. Not Local at all. Try it out for sure
4056,"The ambiance is really big and pretty spacious, liked the place. Ordered a chicken tikka masala pizza, marshmallow and a khatta pudina mocktails. Definitely gonna visit this place again. "

4059,"Unlike others, who visit this place to party at night, I went to Social in the afternoon to drink coffee so I had a different experience from others. It was bad. The place is famous for it's night life, partying and drinks but apart from that the place doesn't hold any good. We ordered cold coffee and some garlic bread, both disappointed us. The cold coffee was just ice and no coffee, the garlic bread was the normal white bread with some masala on top. Not recommended for afternoon visits."
4060,"Food: Gol gappas: 3/5Brownie Fantasy: 4.5/5 (This was so creative, the brownies were kept in a setup of mountain and the icecream was kept as sun. So this gave a view of sunrising from montains, plus the brownie had proper walnuts and was freshly made as it was soft)Ambience: 4.5/5Service: 3/5One of the waiter was good and for the other waiter I kind of got a feeling that he wanted us to vacate the place as soon as possible, which I didn‚Äôt like."
4061,Went there around Christmas. Turned out to be one of the best party experiences in CP. Food was alright but music and the ambience were awesome. 
4062,great place... tagline goes as wholesale bar. and is very nicely done. food is good a lot of street food options which are truly yumm. twisted menu with lot of fun names like asli Aaam... liked the jalebi Rabdi... 
4063,"Visited this place tonight!!! JUST AMAZING!!! :) :) the ambience is superb and so original! We went there for quick bites, so tried Golgappe shots at first!They served 5 pcs. of sooji golgappas with 2 different waters - Sweet and Spicy. The presentation was cool. Then, we tried Brownie Fantasy with draught beer! Brownie was served hot along with vanilla ice cream and chocolate syrup on it. The portion was more than sufficient.The servers were quick! Really liked this place."

What else you can expect from a good place.We hadCheese nachos -5/5Thela chowmein- 5/5Basil margherita pizza- 4/5Hookah (kiwi & paan mixed as suggested by their staff only) -5/5Though we were skeptical about hookah but in the end itturned out to be the best among all the stuff we had.üòä

4066,Good vibe. Decent food. Good service. Cheap Shots. Not that cheap liquor.Nothing bad about the place.. but nothing great about it as well. A decent hangout joint.
4067,Located on the outskirts of CP..The ambience of the place was good both outside and inside...The service was bit lousy and the network problem caused issues with payment with cardThe food was however good especially the farmer vegetable pizza!!

4071,"Although the place is spacious and the ambience is nice but somethings were totally not good. Went there on Christmas dayMusic - music was too loud specially the bass. When the DJ came it got louder, we could barely hear the lyrics. DJ's choice of music was poor.¬†Fun ambience and an overall good vibe. The menu is quite exhaustive but they don't seem to actually have a good portion of it in stock at any given time and that is my biggest gripe with them. The pricing is reasonable for the location and ambience provided. Local Cafe "
4072,"It was my first time here. Heard a lot about the place, so decided to finally pay a visit and experience on my own. I loved the ambience, super spacious and the staff is good too.Food was delicious, especially the pizzas they serve.

4073,Local ‚Äúsimply local and desi. ‚ÄúBest thing they don‚Äôt change the desi Indian food taste.

Food - 4.8/5Ambience- 4.5/5Staff- 4.5/5Price- 3/5 Only thing is that they charge 10% service charge. Which can be ignore because food and cocktails was awesome and a must try.

4082,"I chose to visit Local on my birthday. I was quite surprised to see how extremely huge this place is from the inside. The ambience and interiors are great.  The place seemed pretty crowded for a Saturday afternoon, which I assumed then was good. The food was good although the quantity was not sufficient as compared to the rates mentioned. Availability of all beers and wine as per the menu is questionable. It was a little heavy on the pockets as well. I would say its ‚Äòonce in six months/ date / anniversary/ special occasion ‚Äô kind of a place. "

4088,"It‚Äôs a great setup with good space and nice ambience. We took the table upstairs and it was a good choice for people wanting to talk and catch up and avoiding loud music. They had good options for beers(had dos equips and desperados). Food was good. We were expecting some Good music but DJ was all into trance and it wasn‚Äôt a setup for it. Do not have a floor to dance but since it‚Äôs well spaced, you will find enough space to dance around your table.Bit heavy to pocket but good option. "

We heard a lot about this cafe and were desperately waiting to try it.We ordered plenty of dishes and each one of them were sumptuous both in quantity and quality.First of all, we ordered 2.5 lts of Heineken and it came in a dispenser and was nicely presented.Secondly, we ordered *Khatarnak Loaded cheese nachos, *Farmer Vegetable Pizza and *Peri Peri Chicken Pizza. Nachos had a perfect mixture of cheese, veggies and had a same taste as you order it from any other restaurant.Now coming on to the Pizzas both were thin crust and toppings on them were good enough. We would recommend Peri Peri pizza...read more"
4096,This cafe located at outer circle CP next to Bahrakhamba road.So many times I passed away in front of this cafe and everyone it is really attact me to come inn.So went last night with friends.What all we had tried.Chole Bhatura - 4/5 served very differently.Pizza 5/5 Amazing pizza had a after soo long.G.T chicken tikka fresh and perfectly cooked 4/5Soya chaap 2.5/5 flavour was less.LIT liked it.Hukka was ok.Only my point to give 3.5 is that I am not happy with the service and the attitude of staff.I had asked many times to bring a glass of water than after half n hour I get that.So please do take care of it.Cheers
4097,"Local is a huge caf√© in Connaught Place, perfectly located in the outer circle. This place has a nice ambience and delicious food! The service is a bit slow on busy nights like Friday and Saturday. We tried some really tasty dishes there. We ordered: 1)	Thela style chowmein ‚Äì Perfect alternate for the desi style thela wali noodles. So spicy and tasty. This was my favorite pick of the night! 2)	Fish Fingers ‚Äì Fish fingers is always a right choice. Made to perfection and lip smacking taste.3)	Chicken Tacos ‚Äì The tacos were average in taste and presentation. 4)	Galouti kebab with mini warqi parantha ‚Äì Melt in mouth Galouti kebabs full of flavours.

4099,"Being from Bombay, I was really craving a not familiar name to try on. Most of the restaurants have outlets both in Bombay and Delhi. My folks there took me here. First Impression: Woowww!!Its MASSSIVVEEE!! Though it was a Sunday Night. Most of the tables were reserved. Thank God for our reservation. We got seated upstairs. They have all innovative Menu and a lot of Delhi Things to try on. We tried: 1. Cocktail Panner Aloo Samosa- 5/52. Mediterranean Messe Platter- 5/53. Paneer Picante- 4.5/54.

4100,Good ambience..... cooperative staff..... food was fine..... nice experience..... the variety of cocktail is less so if ur going to drink u might not find ur brand.... Kunal served us well....
4101,I wanted to visit this place as soon as it opened but it was recently only i got a chance to visit this place and i was not disappointed. I liked the interiors and how nicely seating arrangement is done that the place doesn‚Äôt look cluttered at all. We ordered non- vegetarian platter and must say it was nicely cooked and was upto the mark. We ordered few more things and all food items tasted pretty good. The overall experience was good.. good service and good music. Thumbs up from me! 
4102,I like the ambience .. neatly done .. the food is average not that great though .. we ordered their Mediterranean vegetarian platter. the hummus was okay but the other Greek yogurt dip was amazing .. we ordered tandoori platter .. the soya Tikka was not very soft ... the vegetable seekh was over spicy .. over all avg food 
4103,"Food menu was amazing,specially kick ass honey potatoes,and karishma and Sohan was very polite n helpful.i came with my cousins,they really liked this place and the place and the staff was awesome and now LOCAL has become our favourite spot to hangout.5*For the service."
4104,Rude Arrogant Ops manager. Trying to defend employees giving half naked info.. I don‚Äôt recommend this place to anyone. There is a lot of ambiguity with the afternoon and evening menu.. not at all a place to come with friends or for corporate parties. 
4105,Amongst the most unforgettable meal I've ever had ‚ù§ loved the food. Pasta in Peri peri sauce . bravooo. Ambience is great.. To cheer yourself up and party great.its amazing place 
4106,ambience is good..food is ok..presentation could be much better..music really needs to be improved and way better..staff and service is decent..Sunday night was not too crowded..Can get more better..
4107,"We went there for a party on Sunday afternoon.It was really crowded but thankfully we found some space for ourselves.There were a lot of kids, celebrating a birthday party actually so it was really noisy,  children were creating chaos over there.Ambience is really nice, but staff needs to be more alert and courteous.We ordered pasta like naasta but it wasn't that good, Atleast not worth the price.We also ordered chakna platter with the drinks and it was nice.Menu definitely needs some improvement.I feel the food is little overpriced when compared to the quantity and the taste of the food.But still it is worth a visit coz of its ambience. "
4108,"This place is situated in the heart of Delhi which is CP . The ambience of this place is very nice . Food was good but not that much like I heard from people's. Dj was also nice .Sheesha was not that much good but ok it was tolerable.I ordered dahi kebab,spring roll, coffee,kadi chawal and alot of things . I liked dahi kebab  and coffee which I find best among my all things. "
4109,Amazing place to enjoy your dayAwesome music and classy ambianceLoved the servicesWe ordered1) Chicken Pasta Red sauce - 52) GT road Chicken Tikka - 53) Peri Peri chicken Pizza - 54) Chicken momos - 4.55) Railway station ki Mutton Curry - 4.56) Chilly Chicken - 4.5PAAN RAAS exotic hukka was the Show StopperMust visit specially on Friday night or SaturdayVijay kumar and sohan were extremely helpful and available for us all the timeThey served us the best food
4110,The place was very average.. the service was pathetic and food was also not very tasty.. only the hookah was smooth and nice.. the are definitely better places to visit in CP..
4111,"Went there in recommendation by my sister..huge space with nice ambience. I found menu needs a little improvement.. maybe thats my personal experience.. there were range of food items but somehow i felt menu was small.We ordered loca chowmein and mix parantha along with mango sangria.. though chowmein and sangria were good, parantha was too homely including the presentation.. maybe it was too local for me.Would visit again to try different food options"
4112,"Went to this place for lunch this saturday and totally liked it.Ambiance is great with huge seatings and great decor and music,Food is amazing though i thought the dishes were copied from social‚Äôs theme,now the staff i think they were pretty sorted and well behaved....Recommended "
4113,Worst experience ever ... went yesterday (10.03.18) for a lunch. The section where we were sitting had no servers n had to get up twice for menu card . Once the drink was served it was a horror experience ..the sangria first of all was old n very sour and to that it was served in a cracked glass which was dangerous for guest....on yelling the waiter he was least bothered n had to get up n call the manager to have the drink changed .. the ambience was not so great n even food was ok .... over all the service..ambeince was typically local ... living to it's name .. :) ..abive that they charge 10 percent service charge for such clumsy service charge ...to add we took a pizza as take away...read more
4114,It's one of the most recommend cafe. My friends often talk about this place. As it is located in CP and it's convenient for everyone to catch up.Menu offers a wide range for both vegetarian and non vegetarians. Food tasted well.Everything was nice except the seats. Sitting area offered to us was not comfortable and tables were place very closely.would like to visit again for sure. 
4115,"I just love this place, the ambience the way it has been put up. Never feels crowded. And the mouth watering food! I am a hardcore nonveg person but Mann these people serve the best options in veg! PS:- I got to know that, because I had a date, he was vegetarian!! üòÇüòÇ I can't even suggest some good things there whole menu is on point. Local has become my go to places I always tend to go there while I am at CP. My personal favorite are kukkad chawal and mumbaiya pav.. the hookah they make,, waah!! Great .. . The best place who Even has good food rare combination.. üòòüòâüòò"
4116,The food and the overall ambience of the place is really good. Even though it is a little costly but one should must visit this Local if they like to explore new places.
4117,"The place was decent and had good amount of sitting space. The ambiance was good. Tidy and clean.Though we didn't try much but the things we tried weren't a very nice experience. Food was ok but the mocktails weren't good. we ordered a lemon soda and sukha anar, amongst which none was good. They couldn't even provide a good lemon soda which is one of the easiest. Snacks were good we ordered a portion of cheesy nachos, the quantity was very good and pasta in pink sauce was also fine."
4118,Dropped in for an after work drink and stayed longer than planned.Great drinks and very friendly staff.Our server was so friendly and attentive. He really went out of her way to look after us.Will be back again.
4119,"We went here one evening to chill, eat and drink. We tried drinks I had never heard about before - like the NEELI sangria. I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of it because I guess I would rather stick to traditional sangrias and this one just seemed off. We also ordered HUMMUS and PITA which was pretty traditional and good, not outstanding. We got the PERI PERI CHICKEN PIZZA which was good - I like the taste of peri peri so this chicken pizza actually was something I did like. We also got the MAKHAN KEEMA PAO which is a MUST ORDER! It‚Äôs so spicy and flavorful that you‚Äôll keep wanting more! The POP POP CRISPY CHICKEN BASKET was more fried bread crumbs than actual chicken so I didn‚Äôt love that one...read more"

4121,"Good ambiance and drinks but the food quantity was not that good. Overall a nice place to hang out. Stags not allowed, which is a disappointment. "
4122,"I really wish I could write a great review of this place. Highly disappointed and disheartened. Food was stale, drinks tasted of medicine, ambience was boring, staff was very laid back and unprofessional. I wonder how this place has such high ratings.We ordered-Junoon ka phal- a pineapple drink that had a very strong pungent taste and smell, we tried to get the drink changed but the replacement too tasted the same.Tandoori platter- soya chap was raw, dahi ke kebabs were khatta and dry, vegetable seekh was stale, grilled vegetables were either undercooked or over cooked.Mushroom pizza- papad with unmelted cheese3 cheese lasagne- had to cancel the order because we did not had the...read more"

4125,"My experience was really good at this place....the ambience is huge and gives you a funky vibe....for me it was 4.5/5....the food was good too and i was really satisfied with the quantity that they serve for such a good price...i went there with one of my friends....and we've ordered chilly paneer , noodles and coke and we were full half way through...also, the service was really quick and the staff was really helping and sweet...thwy surely know how to attend the customer.I would really recommend you all to try this place atleast once."
4126,"Have been to this place twice and the experience was fine. Management is rude and doesn‚Äôt pay heed to any of your needs. Their music choice is real bad, couldn‚Äôt relate to it but the ambience is good with ample seating. They have tried to imitate Social and you‚Äôll find many similarities in both but the food here is bad. We tried their farmhouse pizza, chilli garlic bread, french fries, pasta, spring rolls and I didn‚Äôt like anything at all but their mocktails and cocktails are great especially aam panna shots and junoon ka fal."
4127,"Noticed this place two before month before the launch, was very keen and finally got a chance to visit the amazing Local bar.Though I don't like their branding and menu- mixed Hindi with English, it makes menu difficult to read.Beer and spirits are priced correctly; offering value for  money with the whole ambience , it was definitely a good one."
4128,"Local is situated near scindia house, just next to time coaching head office, one get ample space for Parking across road, in inner streets. The ambience here is magnificent, the courtyard is humongous. Kudos to the architect!About food - I ordered pizza, pasta, chilli potato and a kabab platter. All were up to the mark in terms of quality and quantity. Taste was fine, good to savor but not extraordinary.Service, hospitality - I was a bit disappointed when the service man didn't listen to our requests and order and we had to call them again and over again to tell the same thing.

4129,"Occasion: Wedding Anniversary celebration of best buddy. He was very much determined to go to Local, but I was not in favor. Lemme tell you, his day, I agreed to go, and it chagned my premeditated perception about this fantastic place and the rating went from 0 to 5 in like 0.5 secs as soon as I entered. The aura of the place is awesome, very prudent and brainy lighting which goes perfectly with the environment and mood. Food... oooooo...dont stop me... it was amazing... we order lahori Chicken, soya chap, red sauce pasta, all delicious. Staff was very suggestive and helpful in choosing the drinks/shots. JD Honey was awesome. The place gives the feeling of Oyster in a desert of concrete."
4130,"The ambience was really cool with music playing and people having fun. The food was so so. We ordered a peri peri chicken pizza and it was fine , a 2.5 out of 5. The service was slow and a bit weird. Since they were asking every 10 min to bring the cheque even though the place was nearly empty. But a good place to party though."
4131,This is one of the best cafee of cp nowadays .. a very spacious cafe .... from the tag line of the cafe ‚Äúwholesale cafe‚Äù we can find cafe is very reasonable at its price and its true ......still doest not take 5 star from my side because of their service.... soo lil service efforts can make complete 5 star cafeeeüéà
4132,I am thinking of trying this place ...from  long days back ...and finally on my birthday i made a plan with some of my friends to visit ..and we make a reservation through Dine-out...Coming to the food it was just ok ...Service is just ok as we have to call the   staff several times ..its really disappointing ...Most of the drinks item its not available ..it spoil our mood...and finally when we ask for bill even that they make mistake its a 50% off on drinks but they give us on food ...they did not co-ordinate with each other as i already talk to manager that we hav 50% off on drinks  ..Ambiance its outstanding ..3 rating its for the ambiance 
4133,"Food was really good and ambience too. Dishes which I tried are really awesome. Looking forward to visit again. You guys can go with your friends,family. "
4134,Outstanding ambience and interior looks. Good and proper serviced and promptly staff. Food and drinks are good and mouth watering. Nice place for hanging out @cp. 
4135,Esa hyped outlet hai yeh.Only vada pav and gol gappa shots and cp smash drink is good here rest every utem is bad.No happy at all.Pizzas were not good at all.they need to improve a lot.
4136,This place looks cool from inside not that much from outside.Big place.Service is great.Food is decent.I mainly liked the ambience and service . One can try out this place.Not so expensive.
4137,"Had the pleasure of a lazy and fun-filled lunch here recently. The food was superb, especially the black dal, the pav bhaji, the ram laddu and the chicken tikka masala. Want to especially mention the team there who are mindful, prompt, polite and elevated the entire experience..."
4138,"It is a nice place with nice ambience and good music choices. The place has very cool and funky vibes with a bit dim lighting. A nice place to party with friends. We ordered veggie pizza, which was great, hummus pita, veg momos, Ceasar salad, golgappa shots, which were awesome üòÖ and heavy drums of heaven for snacks. For main course, it was garlic naan with kadhai paneer and daal makhani. The food was tasty and I liked hummus pita the most. But the service was a bit delayed. Would like to dine here again."
4139,Full points to this place for such amazing interior and decor. The food and service both were top notch. In frame- shahi paneer and butter chicken.
4140,"Talking strictly about the food, I feel that Local is slightly below average. I'm afraid they are basically serving the kind of gimmicky food that only tastes nice when you've downed a few drinks.We ordered:Kick Ass Honey Chilli Potato- Soggy and hardly spicy. Not made well.Bahadur Thela Chowmein- Bland is the only word that comes to mind.Khatarnak Loaded Cheese Nachos- Can't describe the taste. They just did not taste nice.The place is huge and the atmosphere is loud and happening. The order arrives fast but the Servers take a long time to arrive. So, yes, the service is slow and, to top it off, pretty indifferent. They don't seem to be well-trained as well because when I asked...read more"
4141,"It was sure an exquisite visit. The food and ambiance were both extraordinary. And guys, just small bump: Coffee Tonic Water may seem a little different. Otherwise, ya'll need to visit this place ASAP. Solild 4/5."
4142,Ambience is goodHukka is available (key point) but its costly around 1200.Food is okay okay not awesome. only chicken tikka is good. Beer option is less. 
4143,"I visited with friends,enjoyed lot just amazing place to visit ,food was amazing they serve just the great quality,they are good in non vegeterian even better in vegeterian,must try items chicken tikka,gol gappa shots,marshmallow shake"
4144,Best location.Perfect ambience.Amazing crowd.If you want to party hard with some really amazing crowd then this place is for you.Food was great. Do try their Chakna Platter. With chicken momosOne of the largest property in cp.Best time to visit after 10 and they do not entertain stag entries.
4145,Nice ambience and hospitality of the staff. Food and booze both are nice and fill with many options to choose from. DJ is great and speakers will make you jump and dance whereas if looking for a chat with fellow mates that is next to impossible is only a minus. 
4146,"Awesome place,  nicely themed , well located, good staff , food is a treat to your tastebuds , reasonably priced. The only thing i feel has a room of improvement is their mocktail or non alcoholic beverage menu, firstly i ordered for sugarcane juice from their menu which was not available and then sattu drink it was also not available and then kala khaata ice tea whch didnt taste like kala khatta at all and infact was not good at all at last had to order virgin mojito and stick to a basic mocktail .Rest ordered a veg pizza, pan fried noodles , hummus and pita bread , all tasted great üòä"
4147,We had a great time at this restaurant.¬†The Food and cocktails were great and service was amazing. The service really made our dinning experience.Great spot for a fun dinner with great food.
4148,"Had an AMAZING office lunch with my clients at Local.Collection of drinks, presentation and taste of food was remarkable.Got an outstanding service by Mansi. Would surely recommend it to my friends and visit here more often."
4149,The food was scrumptious and heavenly. Mansi is an extremely friendly host. üòå i wish we come back soon and drinks were amaZing. Music was good too
4150,This is an amazing place . We got a chance to be served by Mansi and it was amazing experience.... One of the best so farDo visit ....üòçüòçManu manage was too good...  Great work guys

4152,Very nice service and tasty food. Went there for an evening outing and I was impressed. Has a very different vibe to it compared to other pubs in CP. Quite reasonably priced. 
4153,"Very nice ambience... didn‚Äôt order much though but overall vibe was nice. We had white wine, LIIT, chakhna platter and pita bread and hummus. Hummus was really yumm üòã Though parking was lil tricky but that‚Äôs just the story of cannaught place. "
4154,Hyped outlet in Connaught place yes it is the largest bust not that good.Rajkachori was good.Vada pav and drinks mei cp smash was great.Else every item I had was average.Pizzas were like roti. 
4155,"The place has a good vibe and the ambience is very well done. Considering the food, it was delicious, we got butter chicken & Mutton gravy for the main course and Chicken Tikka (both Mughlai and Malai). "
4156,Amazing place with good ambience.Although food a bit costly but everything we tried there was tasty.Sookha anaar in mocktails and cheesy nachos were too goodüëåüèª
4157,I went to this cafe after hearing good reviews but it was such a disappointment. The whiskey was diluted. They charge you for coke and soda as well which isn‚Äôt charged in any of the cafe/club. Crowd is below average. Food is pathetic. Hookah is OK. The DJ repeats the song a lot. Service charge is up to customer as per Supreme Court guidelines but they charge 20% which is highly unreasonable. I don‚Äôt recommend this cafe. 
4158,Wow so delicious . Last yesterday night I came with my girlfriend and we had great time with local. Very good ambience nice music . I love it and I specially thank to mr. Rajeeav Chef He is the one of the best chef in local he suggested me laal mass and curry Lamb chops .dude wow awesome it‚Äôs to good we love it thanks Rajeeav Chef He makes good day Please guys if go local meet chef Rajeev he make own food as u want thanks all local team  ...I came again with my family definitely ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
4159,"The ambience is great.Must try : no daaru cosmopolitan, chilli chicken and tandoori PlatterService is pretty goodA perfect place for dineouts and chilling "
4160,What an amazing place to hangout with friends. Went in the evening and had an amazing time with some good music.One of the coolest pubs/bars in Connaught Place.We started with Gol Gappa Shots. It was good but not different. Then we ordered Chicken Seekh kebabs and Galouti with wakri parantha. Both the dishes were top notch and must have dishes if you visit this place.Next up was pasta. We didn‚Äôt like it much as we felt it was quite bland.Then we had dal and butter chicken. Again these dishes were delicious with special praise for butter chicken as it had just the right flavours!!A must visit place to sit and chill with friends!!
4161,"As I love to try new places,roaming on the streets of CP I & my friends decided to visit this place.Spacious restaurant & as the name suggest Local the menu is also the same. Although the ambience is good and the restaurant is spacious & the staff is also cooperative what I did not like was the food. We ordered a chicken item which I did not like at all & them French fries which were too oily and were not even crispy & finally we left to eat something good."
4162,Poor service and staff. Went to pebble street instead and had a wonderful time there.  I would strongly request to avoid going to this place. Had a very bad experience #bartalkindia :-(
4163,Hate the food quality. Worst chicken platter ever had.  Pizza was bad too. Expensive menue just because of the ambience which is nice unfortunately 
4164,"Overrated restro. Music average, ambience is ok ok, food is avg. But one thing is so unacceptable is no water in washroom, how do they suppose customer to wash their hands after using washroom. They have  huge space but placed tables everywhere so unorganised. This is surely my first and last visit here. I am still sitting here and about to leave, cnt even wait for next day to write my review.  "
4165,"Local, as the name goes.. menu has all the options.Staff was polite and helpful. Food was good.Best was vodka flavoured shots. It is definately worth a try. We orderd them on repeat. All 4 flavours.Pasta was well cooked in pesto sauce.Place has large occupancy and ambience is well maintained. Would like to visit again."
4166,"Totally value for money!! Lovely ambience, super tasty food, good crowd. Went on Valentine‚Äôs eve. An evening well spent!! Mouthwatering pesto sauce pasta and classic thela style noodles! LIIT is one of the best. Tequila shots mango flavoured were to die for! You must visit this place once to visit again! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
4167,Went there with my friends today .Had ordered Chilli Chicken dry for the starters which turned out to be fine. However were really disappointed with the 'Coffee Toffee' mocktail. The chicken lasagna wasn't that great either. Got our drink replaced with peanut butter shake which was another disappointment. Not a good experience overall. However the place is spacious and ambience is good 
4168,"With an amazing space, name and decor, the place is seldom a disappointment. Local has a great vibe, especially on the weekend nights. With great seating options and good food (nothing too great though), i would still avoid it on it's slow weekdays.A tad bit overpriced, i would give this one a miss if other places are available. "
4169,Mansi was amazing host and gave us a wonderful experience of local!! We had the 3 way hummus pita which was wonderful and tasty!! Ambience was great will be back soon!!!

4172,An absolutely amazing place to get sloshed and is recommended to all party lovers! The music is so loud and make you dance for sure. The place is quite huge and has a good space to dance in front of sitting areas which is a thumbs up. What all I ordered-- Chakna platter- it has 7-8 types of chakna/papas/peanuts/etc essentials. For all the alcohol lovers this is a must have. I am very sure you won‚Äôt be able to finish it completely.- Spring roll- really nice and soft. Love it. - Chilly potatoes- Hard! Yes you read it right! They were really very hard to chew and not at all crispy or soft or anything good. Won‚Äôt recommend this. - Chicken Caesar palette- I wasn‚Äôt really able to...read more

4177,"Local have so much of that what we call great vibes, it's one of the most happening place of Delhi specially in evenings, the place is huge and have great great dance floor and the lovely seating areas, it's one of those places that are really famous for the most happening nights, one of the best music in class and then the place is itself in cannaught place."
4178,Jp yadav is a very good waiter! We enjoyed his service and food was just amazing!!! Best place if you want to have a joyful evening with your friends! Please come over and have one of the best time of your life! 
4179,The service was good. JP Yadav was the person who served and he was good at what he does. The food was bad though. Music and Ambience was better than other places of cp
4180,Jp yadav service was awesome. Hospitality and ambience was another level. Mozarella cheese toast was good Santra local shots must have. Awesome place
4181,JP Yadav served us. The food and service was amazing. The menu was explained well to us and the order was given pretty fast. I would recommend visiting this place and a thumbs up to our waiter.
4182,"An informal place with an absolutely new concept of a local adda... Interiors are done in wood and lightening is kept extremely low.... The food is good and quantity served appropriate.... We ordered Tandoori Non Veg. Platter, Southwestern Chicken Thin Crust Pizza, Perri Perri Butterfly Chicken and Thela Style Egg Chowmein with Fresh Lime Sweet... The presentation of every dish was lovely. We loved the seekh kebabs in platter and Chowmein which actually gave a road side taste in a restaurant setup.... Though we got a bit dismayed by the delay caused in placing the bill.... Besides that the service was good and staff hospitable.... "
4183,Had a great time here at local. The server JP Yadav served well. The food was nice and so was there service. The only thing I didnt like was the green exit sign above my head and music can be better.
4184,"I visited Local along with 3 more friends, really appreciate the hospitality by J.P Yadav. Great good and nice service. Recommended for outing with friends."
4185,"Visited this place on a random thursday afternoon for a some self date. The place has perfect party ambience with great music playing and live cricket screening for everyone. The service was excellent and really impressive! I ordered veg momos along with sangria. To be honest, the momos were bland as the salsa sauce wasn‚Äôt spicy as expected and also the sangria was strong and lacked berry and fruit flavours like normal sangria. A lot of disappointment on food quality end! Later, I tried Paneer Picant√© Pizza and it was really delicious - The paneer, vegetables, Jalape√±o were incredible and the thin crust was crispy! Although it wasn‚Äôt so spicy but it can be balanced by adding some...read more"

4189,"Imagine it's Saturday night you want to party and then you go to a caf√© which has music exactly opposite of your taste ,that's what happened with me . Honestly the aura of the caf√© is really nice ,food was satisfactory , ambience was impressive and music might be according to your taste contrary to mine but the only problem I faced was liquor we had . First we had black dog 12 years ,we were given a bottle and we ourselves broke the seal and it was really nice but when we ordered a second bottle we were served in a decanter and they ensured us it was the same but on having the first sip one could tell it had some cheap brand mixed in it  so overall I was not satisfied with the money we...read more"

4197,"The Ambience is amazing and it's unlike the very expensive places in Delhi. It has a pretty interior and the food is Amazing. Do try the cheesy nachos they are tasty and yes always, the pizza ‚ù§Ô∏è local is a good place to have a party or go out for dinner . As it's not so expensive and is pocket friendly."

First of all this place do not serve pork.. so no issue for halal buddies üôå great ambience, great service, great courtesy.. the quality and quantity of food was amazing... and in budget.

4200,"This is not even Pizza! Not even told! But recommend by the waiter! It‚Äôs a patty with toppings! How rubbish! Too loud music which is pain in ears! Everything is fine.. music, beer, crowd! But patty which is called Pizza?!! Very disappointed! "
4201,"A decent place with average tasting food..We ordered sheesha , non veg platters , chowmin and cocktails but it wasn‚Äôt at all worth the money they charged as there was no one to take care of the requirements of the guests..But have to say that the condiments served along with the dishes were far better than the dishes itself."
4202,@JP Yadav: excellent service.   @food: nice and warm food           @drinks: chilled and alcoholic @ambience: good music and enthralling experience #local#cp

4204,Over hiped worthless place they serve maida ka kulcha in name of pitta bread most of the alcohol listed brands in menu not available and the manager nd staff cant even apologise for the food nd service nd unavablity from menu simply said sir imported beer tho koi bhi availble nhi hogi white rhino pilo achi hi wow
4205,"The place is huge and the music loud, so if you're looking to sit and talk, stay away. Wanna get sloshed and party? You're in the right place.** Food review **I didn't walk in with a lot of expectations but the food was decent. The menu takes on the name of the place, and offers you 'local' food with a bit of a twist. There is continental fare on offer as well.Started with the Veggie Lovers pizza which was yum. Recommended for all vegetarians. This was followed by the River Thames Fish + Chips. Loved every bit of this as well. Beautifully panko-crusted fish, the fries were perfect and there was a bit of a salad on the side which tasted good. The Local Chakhna Platter was a bit of a...read more"
4206,J P YadavIt is the first time i came here and i got best service here from him. He provided beat food products and behaviour is good at the first time.
4207,"Before entering Local yesterday eve, suddenly got reminded of British Raj which stated Dogs & Indians not allowed. Here the well dressed guy standing on the gate said Stags are not allowed on ground floor and we will have to manage on first floor. We were 3, off from office to unwind, got the rude shock and felt like alien in our so called progressive and modern society which talks of women equality, And I fully support and do my bit for it. And here is a MODERN restaurant cum bar living in British Raj. Actually turned out to be very LOCAL in mentality"
4208,This place was fine with awesome music and awesome lighting The prices were very high when compared with the food quantity and the same goes for the drinks. 
4209,"JP yadav was there at our service in d place. And the place, ambience and courtesy was amazing. We hd a sangaria picture which was really good. The place has real hood seating arrangement and Dj. The chiken tikka and agli olio pasta is a must try. To try this place. A new nest fr people looking ou fr new and fresh plce in delhi. Happy Eating üôÉ"
4210,"Refreshing ambiance in CP after a long time.. Good food and great service but a bit expensive. You can enjoy there with your friends for a cricket or football match but the bad part is it is in the wrost quality, you can even see the score bad picture quality.Cost: 1800/couples"
4211,A friend recommended this new restaurant in CP. Guys in my group had a Galla time at this place. Ambience is top notch. Caesar salad and mixed sauce pasta is a must try. Served by Mansi Khanna
4212,Service person JP Yadav is a awesome person .He provides us best suggestion in food & mocktail. Both were awesome . It‚Äôs a great place to visit again. 
4213,JP yadav is an excellent serve...music is too light and vibrant..I love the place and would recommend to all...this infact is the best of all localities var in vicinity...try it out guys...you will fall in love with the place
4214,JP Yadav : Amazing service. Yum food...Vibrant place.... Good music...Variety Menu.Definitely a must go on weekdays as well as on weekends.
4215,Food was amazing and ambience was cool... J P yadav service was nice and his hospitality was very niceWe ordered kadhai paneer  masala and it was good.The no daaru cosmopolitan mocktail was great.Would like to visit again .
4216,"This was my first visit to this place,and the food was great. The ambience is great. We were served by J P Yadav ,and he served us well.We ordered kadhai paneer masala, triple cheese lasagna. The lasagna was ok but the kadhai paneer masala was great.The best was the no Daaru cosmopoliton mocktail. Would like to visit again. "
4217,Went to this place a couple of days back and I must say they have a huge place to their disposal. The upper floor is pure seating and the lower floor is where all the action happens. They serve good food and the quantity is also very good. The waiters are educated about their menu and are aware of what to suggest based on the guests mood. Music played there is superb!!The only instance which made me not to visit this place again is that we found a big mouse on the ceiling which was passing through the pipes. I called the manager and he was apologetic about it but I fear what‚Äôs the deal in their kitchen. Visit it at your own risk!
4218,"Went to this outlet in December with my friends.. we tried alot of different dishes.. but loved the ones i have uploaded. @Among all I personally loved the white sauce pasta, tandoori prawns, chili chicken, hot and sour soup, pomegranate drink( don‚Äôt remember the name),hummus and pita, chicken tikka, kebabs, mutton rice and the best was jalebi and rabri (ordered minimum 4-5 times)üôàThe ambiance is also great. A perfect place to chill on weekends but the only thing which disappointed me was the music. They should really work on that because good music is the heart of any bar/cafe. "
4219,"Disappointed by the service and staff behaviour. At 6 pm no beer was available. Food was good. No feedback form. 3 on 10 rating to me. Sitting, washroom and ambience is nice though but staff - a big NO."
4220,"You will find everything local here. Local tasty food, dhamakedaar mocktails and ekdum behatreen hookah. Talking about the space?? Well, they have acquired a lot of it anf you will never find it difficult to find a place for yourself along with a few friends. Recommendations: 1. Tandoori Soya Chaap2. Any burger of your choice3. Paneer momos4. Cold coffee5. Any signature sheeshaDo make them a visit and help yourself to bless yiur soul. "
4221,"look and feel was nice, but if you are expecting a very tasty food then this place will disappoints you as ambiance was good but the food was even below average. at such price this is really not what you expect."
4222,"This place is too huge, you can find the best place where you want to sit.But the service is very slow. I have been there with my family but it was a big disappointment. We have to call the waiter for 3-4 times for water , same with the food. A place i will recommend not to visit."
4223,"Went on a Saturday with my girlfriend and his brother, they loved the place, although I found it to be over spaced. Music was louder than usual, drinks and munching were served on time. "
4224,I don't like their food....The taste was not good...Soya chaap is okay okay....Serving food style and bill box is too unique...Service-5/5Food-3/5Interiors-5/5
4225,Local that is local wonderful ambience in this cafe all over cp cafe good food and excellent cocktail a hund maoctail the presentation was amazingSpecially chicken seekh kabab.murga malai tikka and malai soya chap was decent and staff was friendly and helpful all over experience is great And manejer was great hi is very great person everything was amazing wonderful experience really I m coming next visit in  this cafe Great cafe in cp

4227,"The seating area at first floor is kind of congested (really low ceiling). However, the DJ was good and kind of decent place to hang out and chit chat.The food menu has a lot of options. Tried Soya Chaap which wasn't really great. "
4228,The ambience was very nice. The non vegetarian food was very good but the vegetarian members of our group including myself were very disappointed with the veggie pizza which was totally bland. The lasagna and chilli paneer were above average but not fantastic. The place needs to work on their bar inventory as well. Out of the 15 or so beers mentioned on the menu only 2 were available.
4229,"Went there today as I had girls in company as they won‚Äôt allow male stags but they do allow female stags .Went through the Bar menu and asked for Heineken but they were not having that ,corona another no .They had 4 beers Kingfisher,edelweiss,dos something and another .No options for beer lovers in total Ordered the most expensive of the four and tasted like kingfisher so 424+taxes down the drain.Ordered two pinacolada‚Äôs but they turned out to be worst .Changed thrice but all were just not made right, in the end left them on the table after a sip or two .Another disappointment.Ordered nachos and fries which were good.In total NOT a place I will recommend to anyone for anything...read more"

4232,"Pathetic food, uncomfortable seating! Overhyped place is the word. Most of the drinks weren‚Äôt available.Monkey shoulder - ordered 1 bottle but they only had 360ml in their bar.Jagermiester - they had none."
4233,Lovely place. The restaurant is of an amazing theme of street style food.Enjoyed our food and drinks thanks to the amazing service by Ms Mansi. Will surely like to visit again :) 
4234,Really liked the place. Got attended by Lalit who took care of all our needs and also suggested some great dishes on the menu. Overall had a nice experience. 
4235,"No option in beer nd wine... Even they dont have any option in red wine, hookah quality is very bad nd no sevices,very late service,food is ok type "
4236,JP YADAV attended us excellent nd the service of him is utmost amazing he suggested us very nice choice of food to us . Nd the dalmakhani is perfectly enriched with its spices nd I just say that simply amazing 10/10
4237,I have been to this place ... Nachos was good but Gandhi ji bread omelette was not good at all.  Ambience was ok..Drinks were average. Thanks 
4238,"The ambience is really cool. The place is lively and service is also good. Order shots, hookah, pizza, burger and thele wali chowmien (the noodles did abosolute justice to the name). Every dish ordered was delicious. I liked the pizza and noodle more. The taste of the noodles proved it‚Äôs name to be correct, it was spicy giving an essence same as what it would feel like eating from any good roadside hawker. Hookah was expensive though but prices of other dishes were reasonable. Hookah was although good. "
4239,I had lunch with some of my colleagues at Local on Day 1. Delicious.I enjoyed a drink at the bar. I had a Margarita. The service was excellent
4240,"The best thing about this place is the ambience. It is very spacy and the interior is very well done. We ordered Chilli Potatoes, White Sauce Pasta and Veg Lasagna in food and they all were delicious. In drinks we had Marshmallow, Coffee Caramel and Peanut butter shake and all very really good. But the service was a bit slow even when we had visited on a Monday afternoon.Ratings:Food - 4Drinks- 4.5Ambience - 4.5Service - 4Overall - 4"
4241,Well a place in the middle of cp and obvsly its famous.But i think that's overhyped and yeah i liked the place but it was expensive.Plus it was crowded and i didt like the sitting.
4242,Food is excellent and ambiance is nice. Really JP yadav take good care of us and we have a good experience here. Really will plan to come once again.
4243,"We had a worst experience at this place, though the ambience was good, the service here is pathetic and the food is also not up to the mark. We ordered a starter platter which was a bad choice. We observed negligence of sheesha guy while changing coals, also the floor manager was way rude and not ready to give us a proper table inspite of the place being empty that day. "
4244,"Giving it 5 stars because we are just love with this place. Ambience,dj,decor everything was just lit once you enter you won't feel like leaving this place. It is a perfect place to party or hangout with your friends.The plus point of this place is that it has a full bar available for drink lovers too.Coming to food we ordered makhan wali pav bhaji and sharbat-e -khasPav Bhaji - Bhaji had perfect blend of spices and floating butter makes it super delicious and it was served with shallow fried pav.

4248,"Pathetic place to go with your friends and family. The staff are not at all professional and they don't know how-to behave with a customer.Humble request from everyone to avoid to go to LOCAL,CP.Thanks "
4249,"It's a nice place to be. The ambience is good and so is the food. It's overpriced like most CP outlets. The staff was courteous. We had kesari dahi kebab, coffee shake, thandai and honey chilli potato. All Tasted good. A must try for all CP wanderers. "
4250,1. Spacious place with seating options on ground & first floor letting you have a view of ground floor.(Ground floor has screen to let you enjoy LIVE matches)2. Food was very much average which was a big Low! (Ordered pizza & salt&pepper chicken)3. Service was averageNot too impressed.90% of Beer options as mentioned in the menu not available.
4251,"An impromptu plan got us here and never really expected it to turn out to be that happening.Crowd was less cause of the time we entered in otherwise the ambience is really peaceful.Service is great too, moreover the food especially the chicken was yum. It's not really expensive and you will enjoy here for sure. Veg was still okay not that commendable but nothing like real bad.Definitely worth a visit."
4252,"I am giving it a 5 star because i just loved this place . Ambience is too good with a lot of space, service is good too . Food is excellent here ordered pasta , dahi ke kabab, honey potatoes. I loved the concept of their local vodka shots at a very reasonable price . Looking forward to visit here again züòä"
4253,"Local has to be one of the good ones amongst the recently opened Bars around Connaught Place.The ambiance is charming, staff is hospitable, and a crafty menu has made it an experience to remember.While the food was good and the drinks were okay, the only part that disappointed me was the desserts.Including western desserts just for the sake of it is bewildering.I've Vaped Cheesecake and Raspberry Creme Brulee better than anything their real desserts had to offer. I'd like to see some innovation there."
4254,"I have been to this amazing place having great ambience. The French fries and pav bhaji are awesome....u will fall in love with the taste. Apart from that ""chakhna"" plate is must try."
4255,Visit was Extremely helpful good.Attender named J P Yadav stood there all that while to attend us.Very attentive.Food and ambience was great too Thanks. :-)
4256,"He food served was delectable and the ambience was ambrosial. Above all, the service is commendable and the helper Mr. J.P Yadav carried out his responsibility with full diligence. Cheers to Local!:D"
4257,Because there was no option of a zero rating. How have people agreed to settle with such poor quality food and service is beyond my understanding. The serving team is just busy in something that you would feel indebted if they serve you. The mocktails were just artificial syrups poured with water. They even managed to ruin nachos!Ugh!
4258,Nyc service by mansi she so cute girl nd food was so yummy nd music is good. Do try basil thai chicken. üòç ambience is amazing. Good range of alcohol
4259,"I recently visited their place again and i was really disappointed with the drinks that we ordered as compared to the first time. We ordered shots, and it had absolutely no alcohol in it.also, all the rates were higher as compared to the first time when i had visited there.And they said that the music will be loud only after 10pm. Though, the food was nice. But am very disappointed. "
4260,JP Yadav. I must say that the service provided by JP Yadav was terrific. One must try this happening joint. DJ and food was awesome. All the best for Local team..

4271,"Over hyped.Decor and music is really good, but when it comes to food and service its highly disappointing. Was not expecting such poor service. It was after 15 mins and 2 reminders that they got us 3 red bull. Pasta was OK, mushroom and garlic pizza had access of garlic and no cheese, as if we are eating a tandoori roti with some mushroom on it."
4272,A good place to have a nice feel and ambience but if you are expecting great food too then this place would disappoint you as ofcrse I like the look and feel of the place but food was not up to the mark.
4273,JP yadav served us ... he was very cooperative .. we had good time in local.. he offered us great seevices and helped us in choosig the best food there... it was overall a good experience

4275,Finally a place with ample space and still great service in CP. The decor and ambience is apt for a weekend party with their club like screens and greay bolly/holly mix of music. Each of drinks are served in a pretty fancy way and taste really great. The food tastes great too! So thumbs up for ambience food and service!

4332,We have served by JP Yadav  Very good job Fooooooooooooood. taste goodService is goooooooooooooooodNice Ambience Good jobDJ toooooooo good
4333,"Apart from the ambience I didn't find anything exciting not even the food. The food was over priced according to the quantity and tasted average. I tried chicken malai tikka , honey chilly potato , paneer tikka , chilly garlic noodles. "
4334,"Good food nd ambience, however the service is not satisfactory. We were here and had to wait 15 minutes for someone to take our orderWorst of all they did not have any Indian beer, only imported beer which are very exp. It's an out dated money making tactic that Delhi pubs often use. Specially the ones in CP, Very Disappointed. Delhi pubs still have long way to go to compete with Gurgaon counterparts"
4335,"Good ambience , lovely music ... had a really good time. Service staff was extremely warm and courteous.  Special thanks to JP Yadav for service :)"
4336,We had a great time here and JP Yadav the person who served us has suggested real nice drinks and we enjoyed the ambience a lot...  It was awesome! 
4337,"Before New Year's Eve, we wanted to try multiple cafes so while cafe hopping, one of the cafes we tried was Local. And as we expected, it turned out to be one of the best cafes in CP to party. We also liked the decor of the place and the way in which DJ is placed there. To top it all, food was also nice. We did not go there for food, but just for some quick drinks and after that day, we can go there just for their delicious delicious food! One should totally try! "
4338,"Went today evening to this place.We were seated on the second floor ,as per the interior and decor lightning was pretty dim.The food i found was average too.Only the mocktails were a standout.I hope they include more items in main course(veg)"
4339,"JP yadav ji was our server. He was great. It was my first time but really loved the place. Great music and atmosphere, highly recommend. Great place in cp to have few drinks and catch up with friends."
4340,"This is one another hanging out place i discovered with my friends. Ambience as a regular cp restaurant. Crowd as any other cp restaurant will have. Or i must say little too crowded.Service as it could have been.But the food, lovely. It serves some good pizza, chilly paneer, dahi ke kebab and special mentions for ""janoon ka fal"" a must must try drink.A little difference could it have made by improving its interiors or concept else a good place to catch up with friends."
4341,-  Really nice place to party . - The crowd is good . - try sitting on ground floor to enjoy the most . 1st floor is slightly quiet - The food is a bit expensive.- good place if you have and Drink and dance.

Everything gets better as the night progresses.Food was not as good as we expected. We ordered a penne pasta and some spring rolls. Both were average.Service was good. There‚Äôs plenty of staff and are decent at their job."
4344,"Local is nestled amongst hundreds of other siblings, the menu theme is very desi, at the very same they serve just everything under the sun with no signature dishes/specific style. Nevertheless the food is good and portions are okayWe ordered:Crispy chicken basket (4/5) the chicken was soft and tender, the dip was good. Only complain was the chicken was way too oily, like probably it did not sit on the kitchen towel after coming or of the fryer.Galouti kebab (4/5) - this was done pretty well, the galouti was adequately flavoured, the warqi prantha was a miss, that's why I couldn't give it 5/5Railway station mutton curry (4/5)My wife was the sole consumer of this dish and she did...read more"

Awesome music but food was okay.. I don't like food much.. i feel chicken was not fresh.. however, chilly potato, pizza and nachos are good in taste.. my rating is only based on ambiance"
4347,Food taste is really bad. Attebdants were busy in their own world. Place is huge but music and menu is quite boring. Wanted to explore this new place but ended up switching to closest pub nearby 
4348,"What I really love about this place is the theme. What I don't is the parking üòë. Certainly it's not the best place of CP but it's considerable. Food and beverages are upto the mark, neither too special nor too bad. For some reasons I really liked the 'thela style' chowmein here üòÇ. Staff is good and responsive. Service is bit slow(not much) but still.. "
4349,"This is a wonderful place for the weekends. They have, by far, the biggest seating area in Connaught Place. The ambiance, the food , the support staff and the  DJ were top notch.        They have an excellent menu of street foods popular across India. We had only vegetarian food and all of them were awesome. The golgappa shots , dahi ke kebabs, pav bhaaji, thele ka chow mein accompanied by chocolate brownie as dessert were  legendary. The services of JP YADAV lucknow wale was outstanding and is worth mentioning."

4361,"The music is so loud, unable to converse and i am talking about 6 n 7 pm ish. If you are going to a place with frnds to have a nice time, i think this is not a place for you because you won't be able to converse with each other. Food n service is fine. "

The peri peri chicken pizza, ginger chicken momos, cheese french fries and chicken basket were ok... nothing to love, nothing to criticize.But there are a few caveats to consider before visiting here. Firstly, their portion sizes are relatively small. Secondly, their customer service is not very impressive. For the price they charge you would expect better."

But we were shown a different menu while ordering and a different one when we asked to show them the menu after the bill was prepared. And the difference that we encountered due to these different menu was almost ‚Çπ1500."

Service- The service is pathetic, They'll take your order and then forget about it for the next hour and half until you yourself figure out what to do now.Music- The dj was on meth.. Chap was playing songs straight from the AUX and that too the years old track.. You need to work on the song selection man!Staff- The manager was not at all co-operative when asked for the unrealistic delay in the order. Instead was rude and unreasonable. "

It was neither too spicy or too bland , just the perfect blend of flavours ! 4/5  What came as an unexpected surprise was the dessert Double ka meetha - a braad pudding dessert! I m still hungover on it . 5/5 . It is a must must try and highly recommended!¬†¬†Overall good food and service! Will definitely order from here again."

Crispy chicken basket, and lamb seekh kabab was very tasty . "
4450,"This place has a great ambience even during day time. I went there on a Monday afternoon and it was amazing. We ordered nachos which were great and super cheesy (although we got them after reminding them thrice about the order) and the drinks they serve, especially the LIITs are superb.I basically went there for sheesha and was highly disappointed. We ordered their double apple sheesha which to me tasted a little sweeter than it normally does. Also, the filter that came along with the sheesha was pricking my mouth continuously. It was kind of hard and made of poor quality plastic. Moreover, the sheesha here costs a little too much, according to me. I mean, there are places serving much...read more"
4451,"The place is kind of stand out in terms of ambience, The footfall on a Tuesday explains the experience people have here. The place is big and bar is amazing. The service is on a little lower side, the servers had to check the availability of menu items and even had to cancel a drink too. The hookah though great is overpriced. The food portion is good and tasty too. Music was nice, though a trail of 90s tracks started when we're about to leave. But definitely a place to hang out with friends, got to explore it on a weekend to get the real feel."
4452,"A good place , pocket friendly. Food was good but not excellent. Ambience ok . Music not so good  , staff was nice though. They really need to work in their music . "
4453,First lets talk about food.1. Food was okay.2. Croud was awesome.3. Music nice4. Staff totally rude even at your entrance you will get bouncer who will misbehave at the time of entrance.4. None of the staff member will give you a positive feelling.5. Alcohol is good.6. One time visit is worth other wise not.
4454,"Ambience: 2Food : 2Staff 1Went there after viewing their good ratings but our experience was not exactly good.I would beging with the biggest flew that is the house is always filled with smoke and hukkah.Not everyone in this world does smoking. Some are non smokers too and non smokers wouldn‚Äôt want to sit under house filled with smoke.Food was as bad as it can be.Staff was not at all good.All the female staff were filled with attitude for no reason, guess they don‚Äôt know that they are only working there and it is guest who matters.But i must add the guy who attended our table was good with his services.Not going again there, thats for sure"

The place is really spacious and the way they have used their space is also commendable. Service staff is bit too snobbish and their manager has no concern for the customers!! Food menu is mundane and limited and is just full of cheese. We ordered nachos, pasta, pizza or garlic bread and the only taste I could have in all of them was of cheese but I loved the aam panna shots and ‚Äújunoon ka fal‚Äù mock tail.Prices are decent, Worth a try."
4466,"Looking something central for a party, this place is worth going to.Massive bar and cafe on the corner of Janpath lane. Delicious food with awesome ambiance.

4479,Really disappointed. The waiters were very rude and un-welcoming. We had to wait at least 5 mins just to get the menu and even then water was not served.We ordered 3 items and all of them were not good enough. Plus they were delivered quite late as well. Our Sunday Afternoon felt like a waste!
4480,Because that was the lowest rating that I could give to this place and that is also only for their ambience. I have tried this place two times and both the times it has been super disappointing. Their service is really bad. Their waiters are not trained well and are rude too. First time I tried their starters and pizza and the food was cold and served really late. Second time me n my friend waited for 45 minutes and they didn't serve anything. Their plates were broken and glasses weren't clean. Not even our drinks ! We left and even spoke to the manager but nothing happened. The place is beautiful and it has awesome interiors but that doesn't work really when you don't treat your...read more

4482,"The saying what you see is what you get is not what this place is about. From the outside it looks like a great place for a Saturday night. The moment you enter, your expectations increase because the layout is pretty neat. But the moment you open the pea sized menu your expectations hit the ground. A measly 5 pager where you can get ""kadhi chawal"" for 450 bucks ?? Don't get me wrong, I LOVE kadhi chawal or rajma chawal for that matter, but not really on a Saturday night with a Martini !

The presentation was fine and had instantly raised my hopes but when it came to tasting the food, I felt dejected. The chili cheese toasties like they call it, weren‚Äôt cheesy or chili to begin with.

4488,Went there in the early hours of Sunday. The service of horrible. Person in charge of our table was getting personal and unprofessional. We ordered a thela style chowmein which the waiter recommended. It was terrible. Definitely not worth the money. I'd definitely not go there again. 
4489,"Been to this place on saturday,Nice ambience, spacious but food is pathetic I have ordered lasagne, pizza and cheese nachos i was not able to take even a second bite, i left all the food orders as it is.

We had pizza, peanut masala, pasta, salt and pepper vegetables, roasted chicken. For drinks we ordered beers, sangria, red bull, a mocktail of theirs that they recommended and turned out to be good called 'junoon ka phal'. Overall, the experience was good and I'd totally revisit. P.s. editing to add that they have great hookahs too! "

4495,"Pani puri does not need any introduction. You can find pani poori vala‚Äôs selling them in nooks and corners in India. It‚Äôs one of the most preferred evening snack. At my home town you will find golgappa stalls selling spicy pani puris along with crisp and delicious aloo tikki, papdi chaat, sev poori and samosa chaat at many places. The aroma coming out of these chaat shops can make anyone drool."
4496,"Beretta is one of the popular spots in San Francisco. I was recommended by a friend so I decided to try! When I walked in, it was full. On a Thursday evening 6:30pm, everywhere is packed. The wait to sit inside was about 30 minutes which wasn't bad at all.After we got sat down, server greeted us right away. We ordered beer and chef's four cheese pizza a bit chewy but it was good.Service is top notch and ambiance is lively and intimate."
4497,Nice place to hang out with friends. Amazing decor and ambience inside along with wooden panelling on outer walls. Music was too loud for me. Service was satisfactory.

4498,"Just around the outer circle, lies the huge local sign board that catches your eye along with the wooden panelling on the outer walls. Local is a fun place to hang out with your friends, family, perfect for a casual ""hang out"" session. The ambience of the place is amazing and will surely distract you from the average food served there, for some time.The drinks were amazing and the music was good.Not a very special experience, just like any other normal cafe, good for hanging out with friends."
4499,"One of the best places you can visit to party especially on weekends. If you happen to visit on weekday then you won't be able to enjoy this place to the max. The service is good and the major reason why it pulls the crowd is the alcohol, you will find reasonable prices with such amazing decor. If you don't have it in your bucket list already then do add it, you won't regret. "

Definitely a great decision as the place have in house dj right in the middle of the sitting space and it rocks big time. We really had good time. What makes it more amazing is the name of dishes. Chai ka punch, no daaru cosmopolitan, aam mojito and so much more. Most of them are named after famous places in Delhi. You will love it.I personally recommend their cocktails, they are way above your expectations. Food was equally amazing, good experiments and presentation.If you are in a group then this is the place to go."

The staff that you next meet is polite and professional. The dishes are well done. They have one of the most innovative drinks menus out there. It involves the classic favorites along with the freshness all adventurous foodies hunt! No daaru Cosmopolitan and Marshmallow shake were my personal picks. The cocktails looked impressive and classy. The aura of the caf√© reflects grace and fun- all packed under one roof! The white sauce pasta was perfected with a creamy sauce.

Food is HIGHLY pathetic.. these guys don‚Äôt even know how to make a chocolate brownie ice cream... everything ordered from appetisers to main course was disgusting..Parking valet guys ask for 100 bucks ... that‚Äôs their customer service....Dont waste you time and money by going there. horrible and terrible food.... very expensive ( don‚Äôt know for what)Why Zomato doesn‚Äôt offer a a negative rating.. minus 10 rating to this...read more

4555,Discriminatory staff. Uncourteous waiters. Pathetic ambience. Over rated and over priced. The food sucks big time and the drinks aren't great either. Head  over to blues across the road. Much better place.
4556,"Bad service. Unwelcoming behavior. As soon as you reach the place, they start judging you. Flashy lights but did not enjoy my time there. Left in a hurry. "
4557,Had a great and amazing time here @ local. The food was perfectly blended with every quality a standard dish holds. The pizza section has a little room for improvement. The drinks and shakes were on point. The ambience was soothing. Last but the thing i liked the most was the service by the complete staff. It was more of a home look a  like service by them. I so want to come and spend another meal here as soon as possible.

4570,"The place was fantastic and the volume of the music wasn‚Äôt an enemy of the eardrums and the voice box (I hope you get the analogy) Yet, I rate this place three stars because the service was terribly slow! It was only when I and my fianc√© reminded the servers of our orders that we placed atleast 20-25 minutes ago, it was served to us in the next 5-7 minutes. I observed many servers just roaming around and hardly ‚Äòserving‚Äô anybody!

When I entered the lounge, I couldn't believe my eyes, as it was quite big. They have seating on ground floor as well as first floor. I loved their screening concept. The 4 screens are placed in a circular manner in the centre of the lounge so that everyone can get a view of the screens.One more thing I noticed that the chairs were different on each table. Every seat was different from the other.I didn't like the food  that much. We ordered the following :-1. Chicken ceaser saladThe salad was okayish. Quantity of chicken was very less.They added some...read more"

Haven‚Äôt received food even after 30mins and staff and manager shows careless attitude even after complaining. they are ready to send you back with bad experience and no food instead of making their customer happy.

Very spacious and comfortableThe food was excellent and the quality and quantity of food was worth the price It is totally value for money  and the service was also very quick .The only problem was that there was a hell lot of variety of food but we could not order due to unavailability of tandoor. . I guess that was just a temporary issue A must visit place for friends and get togethers üòò
4625,"Full points to this place! Warm and friendly staff with great food. We ordered the chicken Tikka pizza, crispy chicken and the loaded nachos. My favorite has to be the crispy chicken. It's almost like the KFC chicken. I think that the place is pocket friendly for those, who wish to get drunk. 6 shots for 175 is super cheap!!! I had 12 shots and went hope happily. Aam Panna and Kaala khatta shots awesome!!!! You cannot miss this place for the world!!! It may seem like a small place from outside but when you step inside, it's got a lot of space.

4646,We went there on a saturday evening the food was very good but the staff was very forgetfulabout the order everytime we ordered. We had to wait for the double time for our food
4647,"Visited this place last nite. It's a big place with a upper section too and private lounge. In the middle of it there is DJ console. Ambience overall was good. We ordered a lot of food(Punjabi can settle for less right üòú). So we ordered gol gappa bombs, thela chowmein, chilli cheese toast, samosa pav and honey chilli potatoes. Everything was good in taste especially samosa pav. Courteous staff and servers . To each its own but I found prices not to much. Overall great experience will visit again."

Loved the chicken pasta, well made and ample amount of chicken. Can avoid the vegetarian pasta for sure.Drinks: Well priced, good for large groups so that you can avail the benefits of wholesale price when ordering in bulk.Service: Good. A lot of people are there to tend to your requests. Courteous staff."

4657,"They Dont respect Customers .We went their on friday evening to check out the much awaited place on our list . But they stopped us on the gates as one of us was wearing Sandals .On being questioned for the reason , the man standing at the gate made fun of us and refused to give any reason . Such an irony that they have named it *Local* and they expect only fine dine customers . There are so many *  better * joints in the vincity , all open handedly welcoming customers as they reasliss the value of customer satisfaction and how much damage such incidents can do to the Brand Equity .

4658,"Recently visited this place which is just on the outer circle of Connaught Place and let me warn you before hand, it just looks small! From the inside, the place is so huge that it has its own terrace sitting, Second floor sitting, smoking area sitting and open floor sitting. Usually the place is fully packed up at late evening even on weekdays. The Menu they serve is so exquisite! Infact locally international! They have so variety of dishes, starting from Our Simply old Indian Masala Papad to Egyptian Style Hummus and Pita bread, you name it! We ordered French fries, Veg Momos and Masala Papad for starters along with peanut butter shake and coffee toffee Mocktail. Trust me, you've never...read more"

Decor is local as the name suggest and it's a good place if you want to know about the Delhi in general üò¨ menu is a highlight too... We just took drinks so will be soon writing about food once I visit it again. Till then go there and be a lo‡§ï‡§≤ Ankit Jari "
4662,Such a beautiful ambience especially the lights! The pasta was nice. Terrace is highlight. Jitender Soni was quite amiable in his hospitality. 5 stars. 
4663,Great ambience nice food!!! Jitender soni was our server and he helped us with everything! From food to sheesha drinks! Thanku local CP we had a great time! Place for family and friends! Must visit!
4664,"Local is one of the upcoming hangout options in the CP which is a not that easy as CP has many established spots which has proven their mettle with the time. So, local has everything for your weekend moods - Dark Ambience, Sheesha, Comfortable Seating and not to forget the amazing food. Loaded Cheese nachos with peanut butter shake is must try, if you are planning to visit Local. The presentation of food is perfect for those insta clicks. I also tried to capture some, you can give it a look. Waiting for Local to get enrolled in Zomato Gold. :) @Local CP "
4665,"We hit ‚ÄúLocal‚Äù a little bit early and it was first time. Nice ambience, juicy Tandoor Chicken & Amazing Chicken Soup. Prices are reasonable and chill for the pocket. But they ask for couple entry after insisting they allow me and my Friend for couple of drinks. "
4666,"Overrated place. It's pretty huge from inside, very spacious and you would not bump into a chair or table if you are walking around. That is pretty much the most exciting thing here.¬†Apart from it, looks like a regular lounge / bar with loud music and a biiig glaring screen at the center which is so much in your face that it puts you off. And it plays random stuff. When I went, there was a dating show for gays playing on VH1.¬†The food is average. I have just stopped expecting quality food in lounges now. The service is average. Because it's dark and so huge, your steward would've gone somewhere else and you would have difficulty in finding him / waving to him to get your food. About...read more"
4667,A huge place for party but shit expensive. I have visited the place but did not found it worthy. The food was ok and that great for which I would to to spend more so I ordered achari paneer tikka and spring rolls. Paneer was fine there is nothing special in their menu and spring rolls were not fried well so didn't ordered any thing else and left the place. Was not satisfied with the service and food.
4668,Perfect place to spend some quality time with your dear ones. Perfect ambience perfect aura perfect food and the best part was service . It was indeed a very nice time spent here
4669,"So finally i got a chance to visit local on a Friday night in a group of 4. The place is centrally located and quite spacious but the seating arrangement was not so comfortable. Food was nicely prepared chicken tikka and pizzas were really well prepared. The chakhna platter  and spring rolls should be avoided. Drinks are priced moderately . The Dj was average . We took an exit at around 10 and checked into MTV FLYP as we did not find it so happening. Overall experience was average. It will not be my first choice when visiting CP especially when u have townhouse,FLYP AND Tamasha just across the road."
4670,"my rating could have gone up to 4.5 but unfortunately due to just one thing it didnt. I have no complaints about the food or the ambience. The chairs were very uncomfortable. Why i'am pointing out this thing is because people come and sit for long hours and if the chairs are not comfortable enough then they might wanna leave early, the way i did. Rest people going there will get amazing options in the menu. A+ to the food."
4671,New place in the town for all the party people.The ambience is perfect and its is quite spacious and very well lit. The food was delicious specially the pizza and dahi ke kabab.The drinks were good.Overall a great place to hangout with friends and family 
4672,"This place definitely lived upto my expectations. I went there after getting a recommendation from a friend and also I wanted to see the balcony area of Local where I have seen so many pictures on Instagram. I went there today and the place has got really amazing vibes. Just as you enter the cafe, you will be warmly treated by the manager who will get you an appropriate place to sit. We chose to sit on the 1st floor because the view was amazing from top and we also got to see the balcony area which has beautiful wooden furniture and grass like background to give it a classy look. The balcony area was closed for sitting but we did manage to click a few shots there. Now coming to the food...read more"
4673,"It is located at a prime location. I went there on my birthday and we tried lot of things. Pizza, pasta, garlic bread. I felt Hummus Pita and Wok salt n pepper are the best dishes I had there. "
4674,One of the best place to party when in Cp . Drinks are reasonable food is nice. This place is new hope they maintain their standard. Looking forward for next visit. 
4675,Nice place with great music. They have a large indoor area that makes the place look huge and airy unlike most of the lounges. Seating is also nice. Food was good. Delivery was very quick. I would love to visit again..! üòäüëç

4677,"Ambience is good but the DJ and the music is not upto the mark. For all the music and dance lovers, this place is not recommended.The drinks menu was very limited and disappointing. Strong beer was missing from the list.Chakna Platter was the cherry on the cake on the disappointment list .The only good thing is the Ambience and the interiors.Overall= 2.5% star rating"
4678,"Went to local on my anniversary(it was wednessday) with some friends for drinks and dinner...gone there with high hope but was disappointed...dnt had all drinks mentioned in menu...staff was really disappointed(according to name and legacy of junkyard cafe), I ordered gaoulati kabab after 20-25 min and recalling them 2 times i was told its not available. Spoiled my mood, it is expensive but it doesn‚Äôt matched any normal restaurant bar. Not at all any comparison to any other club of CP."
4679,"I visited this place on a Sunday afternoon, even in the day light this place was dimly lit, crowded and very lively. I abosolutely loved the ambience and the interior of this place and would love to visit it again. This opinion is not just based on the classy interior and lively ambience but the most important thing for me I.e the food and the service was only bang on. Though their drinks menu was very limited and for me quite disappointing. The service was prompt and they also charge 10% service charge for it which I think is a clear violation of the the GST statute but I wasn‚Äôt surprised since this aren‚Äôt the only good place that fails to understand this statute. I tried the...read more"

4682,Loved the Aam panna shots along with the ambience and service! Not at all over priced like some of the cafe‚Äôs in Delhi! Would like to come often! 
4683,"The place is situated at the outdoor circle so its very very easy to locate the place. the interior and the theme was just mesmerizing, the prices should be a little bit low."
4684,"This resto is right at the corner of KG marg that also provides you a valet parking for 100 rupees. So, no worries about parking. It is spread over two floors with exceptionally good ambience. The DJ plays very good numbers from One Love to Despacito. They have a separate smoking area with sitting also available. Staff is very friendly and quick. They know their part of game. Let‚Äôs talk about food and beverages. We ordered:Dahi k kebab- just one word- perfect. Just perfect. Perfectly crisp, perfectly soft.

4686,"The rating 4.5/10 is because the food served is really tasty and good. Plus the service is fast and the waiters are really friendly. Have visited this place three four times before writing this review. The lights are a bit dim. The music is not too loud. Perfect for couples as well as group of friends. Smoker's zone is also there. They also serve Bira which you won't find in their menu. Try their chhole bhature, pizzas are good and chicken wings were average. Also their street style chowmein was amazing. See the pics. Do follow me on Instagram Sweta for more."
4687,"In my view if you don't drink, this is not the place you would want to visit. I was highly disappointed by the food here. The menu is overpriced and the quantity per dish is too less for anyone. We ordered a lot of food but were not at all satisfied by the quality or the quantity of the food. So in my opinion if you are a teetotaler, there are better places to visit in CP for you. Full marks for the ambience though."
4688,It was a monday evening and we decided to try Local. Being pretty early the place wasn't crowded much. Ambience was good and music could've been better.Let's come to drinks. There isn't much option after 30ml pegs. Either you opt for 30ml or go straight for 360 ml types which is a bit too much.About food. We ordered French fries which were perfect. Peri peri pizza was a downfall. No taste n bland.The overall experience was okay. 
4689,The ambience and the crowd in Local is pretty mesmerizing. The food and drinks (cocktails) are pretty amazing. It is a good experience to visit local. 
4690, I visited with my friends for lunch.. the place is nice and spacious. But food isn‚Äôt great. We ordered a pizza and pasta. The pizza had some bad smell of oil as if something wrong with its cheese or veggie. The mocktails were not great either..!!

4692,The newest in town! Loved the ambiance and food over here! Went on a Friday evening and the buzz was great! Awesome honey chilli potato and malai tikka. Will visit soon again :) 
4693,Worst pizza ever. We ordered their mushroom garlic pizza and the base had no sauce?? The noodles were badly done too. It was a very disappointing experience
4694,Very nice ambience. Perfect place to hang out with friends. Food- ordered achari tikka and pizza. Both were great. Specially the thin crust of the pizza was excellent.The khatta pudina mocktail was good as well.The waiters could be more attentive though.
4695,Good Ambience and food.Highly recommended for party lovers.Would definitely go there again next time.Service was though little slow but it can be due to weekend.Overall a must try place.
4696,"It been time that Local has opened, and till today its one of the best pubs I have been too. The ambience, the food, music and specially there service, everything is too point. The first time i went there was on a saturday and it was jam packed, yet there was no goofing up in the service of food quality. There are alot many options to choose from when it comes to food and drinks, we ordered old school LIIT and one crazy named drink Botlan Sharab Diyan. Both the cocktails are enough to make you happy high without ordering the second round.

The sheesha was smooth and had good flavour. We tried the paan and mint.Food was just amazing. Perfect in taste and flavours. Must try the galouti kebab, veg chowmein, dal makhani, butter chicken and kadhai paneer. Quantity was also excellently done.Service despite of a crowded place was efficient. The staff was courteous.Great place to hold a party or a get together."
4699,"Local never fails to impress me.This time I went with friends for a Halloween event.The place was jam packed with party goers. We managed to find a table. Ordered for a kiwi paan and spring water sheesha, a few drinks like beer and cocktails like old fashioned and stuck to our comfort food. Had paneer tikka, dal makhani, kadhai paneer and dark chocolate cake as a perfect end to our yummy meal. Taste was divine.The music was outstanding. We danced a lot.One of the best party places in the heart of the capital."

The ambiance is incredible, it is very spacious to host big parties, the music sets the mood right, the only thing I wish was better was the lighting since the place is extremely dull. Since today is Halloween, I got the perfect chills there due to its decor. Couple of ghosts here and there, a few dead corpses and coffins. What a decor! Totally spooky! Here is what I ordered : DRINKS - ‚Ä¢ Cold coffee - basic, had vanilla ice cream in it, not that cold, sweet ofcourse.‚Ä¢ No daaru Cosmopolitan - had that fruit punch in it and the spices balanced the drink well.‚Ä¢ Caramel Coffee - lacked the taste of...read more"
4704,"Was here on a sort of short visit. Visited the restaurant last Friday around lunch timing. The decor is pretty classy, yet comfortable. Slightly dark, but manageable. Craving something cheesy to munch on, we ordered a loaded nachos. And then didn't disappoint in taste at all! The quantity, too, was good. Next on, we ordered for Honey Chilli Potatoes and a Fresh Lime Soda. The soda was average, but the potatoes were, again, quite tasteful. For the mere 3 things, ended up paying 1k. Good as a drinking place, probably, but a bit on the high end for food. "
4705,"Nice place to hangout with friends. Your party mode gets on over there.Food is also good...Loud music...dark interio...Always seen jam pack during weekends.Thank god they provide valet service...but they should try making it cheaper or complimentary.I personally faced poor service over their twice.Overall a good experience, only thing to look into is their service during peak hours."
4706,"Local, located in Connaught Place is a spacious happening place to go with friends. Here DJ area located on the ground floor is the centre of attraction.

Little chicken chunks well prepared. Delicious. Drums of heaven: Good no.of. well prepared chicken pieces with right amount of spices with spring onions etc on that.

4708,"Apart from having cool vibes, happy music, good food and huge space there are 2 things about Local which are worth mentioning..-> Their staff, Dude they give me a feeling of some commandos in action.. Very well dressed, well spoken, always active and highly humble!-> Their music! Love love their playlist!¬†Also, thing to note: i don't think they allow stag entry so check before you decide to go there!¬†It's not very different from other CP outlets but it's certainly better from most of them and is my new favorite these days!"
4709,"Amazing place to hangout with friends. Amazing ambience, great music, superb service. Definitely visiting again.The food goes completely in sync with the name of this place. Every dish that we tried here had local street food like taste. Actually it is surprising to find such good food in a CP restro. Not a single dish we ordered was bad, some of them were even highly impressive."

Yes, sometimes the place' ambience takes over its food and I am mighty impressed with this magnificent restaurant cum lounge cum club of a place. The booze was a li'l expensive though and they again (like it's almost a thumb rule for all dining out places today to cheat you in drinks that they serve) kinda cheated and diluted the drinks. My LIT had more ice cubes than the daaru itself, which was a bummer to say the least."

The attendant, in his eagerness to please I have to assume, said yes sir I got it before we could even finish properly. He returned after few minutes with my beer and his drink (no lemon). My husband reminded him saying ""I'd asked for a slice of lemon"". The poor guy gave an enigmatic smile saying ""yes sir. yes sir, be right back"".

4731,"I visited Lo‡§ï‡§≤ yesterday. Ambience is awesome! Food was good too. I ordered No Daaru Cosmopolitan, it was good in taste, but I wasn't impressed much by the presentation. Service was amazing! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
4732,The place is an all rounder serving with you the best of food and drinks to the ambience and crowd. They attract you so well that you just can‚Äôt get over them. The service is amazing and place is ‚ÄúLit‚Äù as expectedly. The menu serves you a lot variety with a twist in their name.
4733,After hearing so much about this place planned a outing with freinds and wanted to check why this place is talk of the town . The interior and the decor with the mood setting music adds up to the dining experience.¬†Food :- Tried chicken tikka pizza and chilli chicken which was delicious .Drinks :- Most disappointing thing they dont have beers which we asked for and upselling brands which are expensive . Moreover they dont have corona :( ¬†Hahahaha¬†The most bizzare thing when going out just saw corona being served to another table. I personally asked the FnB associate why it was refused ( we dont have ) to me and served to other guest he simply gave scripted reply please speak to my...read more
4734,No doubt the place is supercool. Great Ambience but food not so good.. Tasteless .. We ordered Chilli cheese toast which was good (3.5/5) lacked in crispyness of the bread or base .. ordered veggie Pizza which we requested to customise like add on for jalapeno n more of spicy but it was tasteless.. we returned it as it was not according to our taste (1/5) but then nwe replaced by Chiili Paneer (4/5) good taste. Mocktails very common not much variety n order Caramel coffee shake which was good.(4/5) . Once if they work in the taste preference the place will gonna rock.. More variety in food & mocktails are expected. 
4735,They open bars to couples only... What's that...! Such a shame... Grow up Local....Headed to Tamasha and yes they were fun.. I wish there was a zero rating üòÜ
4736,"Great place to be with nice ambiance,but service is missing.food is great especially the way it is presented.Restaurant is awsome but need lot of training to staff and manager should be role model not occupy on phone on all time.We asked to changed table but no response from him.Need to wait for atleast 20 minute to take order..Place is good but don‚Äôt expect a service there better go to Haldiram in CP for service.."
4737,"I don't know what.. but this place had something.. even before it opened in CP.. I used to see this opening soon sign there and was eagerly waiting for the doors to open..And when it did, I got a chance to host a party there.. woohoo!!The place is enormous and amazing.. we went there on a Saturday night.. and had fun..The food is good and yumm but nothing extraordinary. Even the drinks felt diluted.. Though.. the prices that they offer are not very high.. so.. putting the prices and food together.. that's a good deal after all.We were there till midnight.. And longing to Dance.. but the music played was not much of a Dancing kind.. so we were just disappointed by that..To conclude.....read more"
4738,Bad bad and simply bad. .. Nowhere does zomato mentions that this place has a stag entry policy.. We had heard good vibes about this place but as everything that glitters is not gold ..This place is a prime example of that. I simply refuse to acknowledge that how and I mean how u can refuse your customers based on a weird rule for stag entry ..So all in all what they r are referring is only couple's can have entry here.  And when I want to hang out with my friends ...no no u guys are not allowed to have fun and have a gud time here 
4739,"I have been there with my two friends and it was worth spending ur bucks there, as they have a gud space with a satisfying ambience as well. Food was fine, need to improve the quality of pasta, sheesha was awesome but it won't last long. Music and service was also fine to me. U can click some pictures there as they have large space to roam around. Overall experience was fine. "
4740,"Great spacious place with the most incredible EDM music. Excellent to hit up with friends. We tried the LIIT, crispy chicken platter, chicken wings, chicken tikka pizza, masala peanut, & Singaporean noodles. Everything tasted good."
4741,"Visited this place today with my fiancee.Ambience was good but the music was very boring. We orderd monchow soup. It was very delicious and served very nicely. Then we had thela style chowmin. It was ok , not very delicious. Lastly we had our main course ( Dal makhni and lachha parantha). It was tasty too. Then as we came out of the place after paying the bill to take our car from velet, I was told by velet to pay Rs 100 for parking. 100 rupees is not such a big deal but i felt cheated because nowhere in delhi we are charged by cafe's velet parking. This was utterly disgusting and unfair on the part of this cafe to indulge into such a malpractice. I would request the manager to look into...read more"
4742,I came here with my friends in CP local outlet it was amazing place of you and my service for Mr Sachin Kumar is a stupid up there and I like such as person because he has good knowledge and he is a good boy.. I like such a restaurant and thank you so much Mr Sachin for giving me your service... their management is very nice 
4743,Awesome place.. Awesome ambience.. And the food is super hit. Tried their many street food items and all were too good. This is a must visit place for weekend outings. Just loved it.
4744,"My friends and I popped in here for an impromptu rendezvous and the staff graciously found us a table for 4 (on a Sunday!). Though the place is known for its economically priced shots, it stayed with us for its amazing ambience. Food and drinks are value for money, if not in quality, then in quantity. The lax service, on the other hand, left something to be desired. "
4745,"Easy to reach destination with attractive exteriors, a big lounge with decent sitting capacity. Coming to Service, not amazing but yes it is decent. I didn't have a good day as most of the items served were over-salty which spoiled the taste!!Fish tikka was good in taste though marination was again more salty. Veggie Lover Pizza and Thela style chowmein were saviour.Brownie served at the end was really bad in taste.All in all Overpriced and nothing to hype about lounge, good for friends meet!!Think twice before visiting!!Many good outlets with a better taste and food servings are located in the same area!!"
4746,"I tell I m not a great foofdie but yes I m a drinker and drinks are good. Kamakazi and aam shots were fab. Apart from that  I am a big time music fan and the dj here on 15th was pathetic. Around 12 people even started to throw tissues on him but still he didn't played their choice. Big time no for music and dance lovers. If you just have eat, drink and chat you can visit the place"
4747,"We were a group of 10ppl and we were treated as if were a burden to them. Our IDs we're checked which was completely fine but there was a guy called piyush( I think) right at the entrance who was very rude. Food was v average. The best part was the music but even after paying 19k for a table, u end up treated like shit, it spoils everything."
4748,"It was an afternoon visit with a friend, very dark, dull and shady ambience. Menu as well not so exciting. Standard food items and taste okay. "
4749,The place is just like the name suggests ‚Äòlocal‚Äô. The pace is huge it probably has the largest seating capacity in Delhi but have the worst customer service. We sat on the first floor and the place was relatively Empty and still it was hard to get hold of a server. Every time we called a server he would say one minute and go to one of the corners where all the other servers were just hanging out and not doing any work. The servers just don‚Äôt listen and just gather in one corner and chit chat. Coming to the food don‚Äôt even know where to start. Defiantly one of the worst tasting foods in Delhi. At this time when every other place is bang on with their food this place just fails...read more
4750,This is such a quaint little place to enjoy a drink and tasty food.My friends and I stopped in on a whim for a drink. We were so pleasantly surprised by the service we received from our waiter.It was our first time here and this place exceeded our expectations!
4751,Went here with friends for a get together last month and was quite impressed by the interiors. Such a huge space but food was just fine. Service was quite. It's quite a happening place and feels local. 
4752, Chicken Sorcery hot is so much yummy and mouth watering. It is soft and crispy and the taste of the chicken is also delicious that if you are the non veg lover then it is the perfect dish which can make your day a perfect day.
4753,"The USP of this place is that they justify their name ""Local"". The taste seems so authentic as made locally and so are the prices, truly local. The food here is really delicious and drinks are equally refreshing. I had Cold Coffe and No Daaru Cosmopolitan. The No Daaru Cosmopolitan is one of the best they have. Truly Cosmopolitan. Must-drink. Even the Coffee is marvellous.For food, I had Vada Paav, Chowmein, Mushroom Pyaaz Matar Sabz, Dal Makhani, Railway Mutton Curry, Lachha Paratha and Rice. The Vada Pav is so crunchy and flavorful. Amazing taste and flavors. The Chowmein was so yumm. It was exctly as we use to eat at any road-side stall. The Indian main course, Mushroom...read more"
4754,"After hearing so much about this new place in CP I thought of giving it a try also I wanted to check it myself as well if the place is worth the hype?I visited this place last week on a weekday with a friend. We visited here for an early dinner and still the place was half filled. As soon as I entered the place i was stunned with its beautiful interiors! It is a huge property with two floors, ground and first floor. The high ceiling made the place look even bigger. We started our meal here with couple of drinks- ordered for a cold coffee and Junoon ka fal. Junoon Ka Fal was a pineapple juice based drink and it was too sweet for my taste buds so I'll suggest you guys to avoid it but...read more"
4755,"If you are bored of those lounges in CP that just look a copy of each other, then Local will offer you a much-needed relief. Well, food is not exactly the high point of this place. But yeah, if you want to grab some drinks and have a good time with your friends, then this is a place to be.¬†AMBIANCEFull marks for the ambiance! As you enter this place, you will receive club-like vibes, especially due to the vibrant, LED screen just in the middle. The colossal roof height makes it look even bigger. If you want some privacy with your friends, you can choose a table in the smoking area. The first floor was not operational when we visited the place. The overall raw feel of the walls...read more"
4756,"Amazing place to hangout with friends. Went their this tuesday. Amazing ambience, great music, superb service. Definitely visiting again with new people.We ordered quinoa salad, veg spring roll, mix sauce penne pasta, tandoori soya chaap, dahi kebab, hoegarden pitcher, botlan sharab diyan (cocktail) and virgin mint mojito. Everything was great in taste, superb quantity and quality. Highly recommended."
4757,"My experience was average. The ambience was good and we ordered crispy chicken after that curry chicken and naan, it was not good. Chicken was not cooked properly. "
4758,"As the name suggests, this place is very cool enough to hangout with friends.It is just the local hangout place to have good food there.The paneer momos was the best part of our lunch.In beverages section, I took khatta pudina it was refreshing though."

4763,"Local- It was my cousin‚Äôs birthday eve..so after wandering for 1 hour in cp we decided to go local as heard good about the place. First thing that disappointed me they didn‚Äôt even served us water. We were served water after asking 2-3 times for it :( . Then if i talk about food, we ordered pasta that was okayish in taste. Honey chilly potato was good in taste presented nicely. Veggie lovers pizza was amazing üòç.  It had the best and perfect toppings. Chole bhature were just literally heart touching üôà.

4765,"AMBIENCE/ SERVICE- 4/5Went for dinner on Wednesday night and the place was packed. Unique ambience and massive space that makes it stand out.

4769,This was a quite nice place. Didn‚Äôt liked ambience that much. Staff and food was delivered on time. Order hummus n pita bread which was nice. Also ordered chilly potato. They were fresh n crispy. Will go again 
4770,Loved the ambience....dj was suppeerrrr amaaziiingggg....good music....good food....total value for money....ppl should go visit local for sure
4771,"Bookmarked this place since long based on the rating and reviews here, but was highly disappointed on knowing that stags are not allowed. For what reason guys? Is it a high-end club? Or if you assume it to be then it should be mentioned here in Zomato that stags are not entertained, atleast we should have not wasted our time planning and visiting you."
4772,"We have been seeing so much of this on social media that we had to pay a visit.So we have planned out Saturday evening here, the ambience is good, interiors are well built with two stories, each table having dim lighting. But as you here the hype of the place you tend to expect more that may be this place is something really different from those which are already opened in the market. But to our surprise there was nothing that matched the hype, yes it‚Äôs new, yes it gives a club sort of feeling but what else.Hence, to us this once just like others, the menu is continental, indian and bites which goes well with your drinks.We ordered Chilly Mushroom which came in a big plate th...read more"
4773,Food - 4.0Ambience - 4.5Location - 4.5Service - 4.0Cafe local is a good place to go with your friends and have a chilled out time. A very dark and soothing ambience adds to the mood. Had ordered Kadhai Paneer Masala with Laccha ParanthaVeg Spring RollsFood was abpve average and the service was bit slow.
4774,Went there with friends on sunday.. it was bit crowded.. they really need to work on there management..they were very rude..Food doesn't even worth the price.. the regular hookah was so costly and it wasn't even a good one..noddles so bad and tasteless.. Honey chilly potatoes were so bad that we didn't even finish it.. chilly paneer were fine but not upto the mark.. the music was so low that you could hear people talking 5 tables far from you.. it made my experience so noisy.. i'm giving it 1.5 stars just coz of the ambience.. i'm not going there again or my friends.. 
4775,"This weak I visited this place with my friends and it was full of crowd. It was my first visit at local restaurant ! Gone there for enjoyment with old friendsNo doubt ambience and music was really nice.First we ordered sheesha and drinks ( ultra beer ) something wrong with the beer that was smelling (LIKE CARTON) One more thing restaurant was empty on ground floor but they were offering the table on first floor without asking guest preference.We asked for table to change because of high AC was on head but no response from manger side, crowd was there that is why that's understood but the drinks spoil are mood and we asked for the bill and moved out in 25 minutes from there."
4776,"Great service and courteous staff! The manager, Mr. Jay was very considerate. Food was delectable and drinks were delicious. Would definitely come again!"
4777,Newly opened cafe in cp place was huge n ambiance is also good food was ok but oty is very less as par there price its a street food concept best place for street food lover
4778,"Absolutely in love with this place. I rarely come to CP but in between a meeting ended up grabbing a beer here. Perfect music for the afternoon. Very well prepared ceaser salad, dim lit yet lively ambience. People should check it out... "
4779,"The best one in Connaught Place for sure. Huge place, amazing interiors and quality food. Local is the not so local hangout venue for the chill seekers and foodies out there. Also, not very heavy on the pocket. Food-Veggie pizza- huge pizza, enough for 3 people. Perfect crust and appropriately loaded.Loaded Nachos- crunchy and true to its name, fully loaded. All in all, good place to catch a bite. Though service could be improved. Recommended."
4780,I have been twice and always enjoyed myself. Good music and great drinks. I even brought family and friends there on this visit. Definitely a nice cool out spot.

4784,"Tried and disappointed. We found the ambience and the floor setup appealing but the food was below par. The worst thing was that they managed to mess up the Pizza.. My friend ordered for marshmallow shake which was too bland. Later on they replaced it with cold coffee. Few eatable things were- soya chap starters and no daaru cosmo, ice tea n cold coffee. Basically it's a good place for cocktails n photography. Regrettable fooding. "

4787,"So it was 40 degrees outside and I was shopping when I saw the place and wanted to go in for a couple of drinks before moving on. I was alone,  allowed inside but then a waitress came running saying stag not allowed. And it was a Tuesday afternoon at 3. I have no issues with the crew,  they were polite but the management needs to look into the policy. Am I supposed to get my girlfriend each time I feel the need of a drink? Not recommending it or visiting it either. "
4788,Amazing place with amazing food and amazing hospitality by Vijay ‚ò∫Ô∏è #mustgoo My favourite dish here is mutton chawal... ull love everything about this place 
4789,so i m gonna rate a few thingsAmbience-> Awesome(5)food-> awesome(5)service-> good(3)apart from service there is nothing that could possibly undermine this place p.s the bar has some quality liquor!ü§§
4790,Very nicely served by mr.jay great ambience friendly nature fully satisfied with his service and i‚Äôll always party at lOCAL and will always suggest LOCAL for parties
4791,Amazing and a very lively place even on a Monday plus a dry day. Good food and good sheesha. Courteous staff and very approachable manager (Mr Jay) Loved it ‚úåÔ∏è 
4792,Best place to party in Delhi as of today. Even Sunday nights are as good as Saturday nights. Crowd is excellent; food is ‚Äúlocal‚Äù as the name suggests but with the best kinds available like Thela Chowmein. Drinks are decent. Overall a chill place!
4793,Staff n rules are highly discriminating on the basis of attire wore by both males n females visiting the the place...we had a worst experience visiting there when one of our friends wasn't allowed to enter during the mid of our party at Local for wearing Puma slippers...the staff claimed that they denied the entry because of him not adhering to the club rules as laid by government of India to wear formal shoes...no one is allowed to enter in slippers in any club in India...it's against India law...so rude behaviour of the managerial staff...
4794,"I went to this place after reading a lot about it on blogs and the internet. Especially, about their wholesale prices for liquor. There‚Äôs nothing that‚Äôs too special about the place. It is an average place for a good weekend evening. Undoubtedly, the place is big and spacious but the music wasn‚Äôt good enough. Food was okayish. "
4795,Great ambience and great food...spacious place and full of life..special mention for Jagdish who really took great care and served us with a smile..

4800,Just lovely .Great ambience right from the moment you step inside. The name might be local but the place isn't. Loved the concept of retails vs wholesale üòÑ. The hookah was nicely made.The staff was very courteous and service was amazing at least can say about Rakesh Rawat.üëå

4803,"Centrally located in the heart of Delhi, Local is yet another chilling place for Delhi people with some good food and spacious seating. We liked the food, the ambience was good but not very different from the usual ones.We loved the drinks! Pizza was tasty. Music is fine. "

With the fanciest cutlery I‚Äôve seen, Local definitely lives up to all the attention and hype it‚Äôs getting. For food we ordered chicken breast in Peri Peri sauce served with mashed potatoes and veggies, and Shish Tauk. Both our starters were super filling and so delicious that we barely took minutes to finish them. For drinks we ordered an LIIT and their ‚Äòlocally‚Äô priced shots.

4806,"Good place to hangout with your friends on a Saturday evening, surely the place if u wanna empty ur pockets ;). Food and beverages served taste good and a 5* for the ambience only the service is slow and servers lose their mind on a Saturday night. We got a bill for around 30k for 10 people and the management was not ready to give us a table even though we reached at aound 7 or 7.30. Make sure u talk to the manager first before walking in and take a deal instead of going for ala carte."
4807,"With CP already flooded with cafes, opening of a new place there doesn't excite you as much as it used to a year back from now. Though the story for Local has been totally different which has been getting a lot of attention and has created a huge hype for itself. And in midst of this herd of cafes, if a place is this much talked about, you ought to try it out. So we planned to visit them for lunch to check out what exactly is the hype all about."
4808,Fries!! And d shots tray was unique we had 6 shots each and enjoyed it. 4 seasons pizza was gud. Fish tikka was yum and plz guys don't forget to try their thele wale chowmein ( I had non veg) and totally loved it. Thele wale chowmein is a must must try along with d ambience. This place is definitely made very differently and is best in cp ambience wise!!
4809,"Not like an other place in c.p. i never expected ""Local"" to be this huge..it has that rustic look in it. I was instantly in love with this place... The best part was i being lucky at this place because whenever i planned to visit this place i always manage to have a table without waiting for it. Otherwise there is huge waiting over here.. And its worth it..So food was delicious, tummy filling as presentation was also very good.We ordered many vairety... And all were fab.Being vegitarian.. We generally dont get much option but at local.. We hogged like pig and food quality and quanity made it worthy. Zabardast cheese nachos.. üòòChole bhature.. 3.8/5Paneer corn tacos.....read more"

4813,"Don't have many pictures coz I was busy enjoying! I love local! It's a very nice place. Nothing different as such from the other places in Cp, but it's great! Only minus is the Dj. Doesn't play Bollywood much even if requested ://Food is pretty yumm!I had chilly chicken, drums of heaven, chicken malai tikka, veg spring rolls, fish finger which were really really yumm!!Nachos, pizzas and tandoori chicken were okaaay. Hooks is slightly expensive than other places.Service and staff is superb!!"

4815,"The Gentleman at the front desk told me that persons wearing sandals are not allowed. Such rules for a ""local"" bar makes me wonder in which era I am living."
4816,I have been to local cafe and i found the place full of people  engulf in dancing  .. such a huge place .ambiance is toooo good .. and the staff is  soo polite and humble .....   and the managers  like Vishal and nitin are the coolest  manager  i have ever met.....keep rocking guys...
4817,"First, their list of entry rules make you so annoyed! Secondly, My wallet went missing in this shitty cafe! I went crazy as it had all my cash, cards and DL. When confronted, the manager and team were not ready to take the responsibility of the stolen wallet. Instead they said you might have dropped it somewhere passing away the blame from them. I asked them to show me the cctv footage which i got access to after waiting for half and hour. The 'Local Team' and me clearly saw the sweeper sweeping away my fallen wallet from the floor and taking it away. The staff went mad and kept looking for the right sweeper! While returning the wallet the manager tells me 'Sir, he had by mistake taken it...read more"

4820,"Amazing food , ambience , decor , service and i cant even begin to tell how reasonable it feels at the end of the experience..Loved it so much that i went here back to back on a weekend.. Four cheese pizza pasta ( red and white) mushrooms .. chaap.. kebabs.. drinks.. everything was fantastic and the bill was pretty reasonable.. Worth every penny ...crowd was amazing..Service was amazing .. Vishal Chaudhary hope u r happy seeing my review ;)"
4821,"The place is a must visit at the centre of Delhi. Just one thing that you need to remember don't wear shorts or sleepers, they won't allow you in. The ambience was good and you have so many different options to sit and enjoy your meal. We tasted Afghani Chaap, Salt and Pepper, Samosa paneer chat, coffee peanut butter shake, triple cheeze Italian lasgna and Veggie pizza. All the dishes were lip smacking and sumptuous. I am looking forward to my next visit desperately and try out their other offerings. "
4822,"Read some great reviews on zomato about this place so i decided to go to  this place on my birthday. I went with a friend of mine .The ambience is nice similar to a lot of cafes in cp. Nthing very great. The staff was courteous and prompt in service.Coming to the food we ordered a penne pesto pasta,honey chilli potatoes and paneer tikka tacos. Pasta was more like white sauce nthing great. Chilli potatoes and paneer tikka tacos tasted fine.In drinks we ordered two no daaru cosmopolitan. Which were nice and refreshing. Overall its a good place to go out with your freinds and enjoy a drink."
4823,The best thing about this place is the ambiance. Very impressive interiors. Food- was average. The service is a bit slow even during non rush hours. A decent place to go to on a Saturday night. Drinks menu is good! 
4824,Rate - 2/5Service -2.5/5My experience was not so good with this place !I went to this cafe on next day of opening ... it was weekday !! I ordered Local  chakhna platter and one pint of beer !! Service was poor ... we had to wait very long to get the food and second most important thing which I feel it's expensive place to visit !!I didn't find any awesome kind of option there !! So I don't suggest to go there for some good outing or for a date üòÇ
4825,Amazing food and amazing ambience. The fast service makes it great. The place just changes after 11 pm when the crowd sets the dance floor on fire. The manager (Mr.Nitin Jayand) is very polite and makes sure everything goes smooth. The perfect place for weekends. 
4826,Amazing place Love the experience over ........only the music is repeated ... Nitin helped helped ...lokash told us to come to this place  told us to
4827,Was hosted by Nitin here. Brilliant service for a Saturday night and amazing music. It‚Äôs the only place in Delhi I would recommend to anyone who isn‚Äôt from here. GOOD USIC LIVELY AND BRILLIANT DANCE FLOOR 
4828,Ambience is amazing with different types of lights and sounds effects. The quality of food is good and the best part of local is the location. Overall It is good place to hangout with friends.
4829,"Visited Local-CP on a friends birthday in August. It was pretty packed and lively for a Sunday, especially considering the fact that it was newly opened back then. Good space coupled with good music is what comes first about this place! Second comes the choice of spirits being offered in the menu. Sadly, I couldn't try the food since the kitchen got closed by the time I'd reached. The serving style and presentation is okay but overall service has some scope for improvement.¬†A good experience on the whole. Would visit again. :)"
4830,Good place to hangout with your friends. A variety of items to choose from both in food and drinks..
4831,Local is one beautiful and spacious new entrant to the array of lounges and restaurants in CP. The place is huge with wooden interiors and dim yellow lighting which compliments each other perfectly. The whole place gives out good vibes with jazzy music which makes your evening a pleasant one. ¬†The whole concept of Local is to bring all the flavours from hidden corners of your locality under one roof.
4832,It was an awesome place.. With beautiful ambience.. Comfortable couch will make your moment more special.. Food quality is superb.. Music is so relaxing.. Interior is fantastic and will make you feel nostalgic.. Fast and quality service.. Must visit there once..
4833,"This place is surely over hyped like many others. The only good thing about this place is its prime location. Staff was friendly and pretty efficient in its service. However, food had a low factor. We ordered :‡§¨‡§π‡§æ‡§¶‡•Å‡§∞ Thela Style Chowmein which was ordinary van-like Chowmein but at a whooping price. ‡§§‡•Ä‡§ñ‡§æ Chilli Cheese Toast, it was a below average dish. ‡§ó‡•Å‡§™‡•ç‡§§‡§æ‡§ú‡•Ä Ka Aloo Tikki Burger, again an average burger.‡§•‡§æ‡§™‡§æ Style Veg Spring Rolls.

4835,Came here for food and drinks on a Friday afternoon. Laid back vibe and a good spot to catch up with friends. ¬†Loved the ambiance and everything about this place. The chicken tikka was so delicious and chicken nuggets were one of the best I ever had. ¬†The cocktails were perfectly crafted as well. A happy experience indeed.
4836,The food and ambience is really good. It was raining and they had helpers carrying umbrella for the customers ! That was really sweet. The drinks are prepared well !

4838,Local is a welcoming surprise in terms of its spacious interiors and excellent food. I was here the other day with my friends and boy what an experience! Started with the VADA PAO with tasted delicious and was kept simple without trying to make it fancy. The RAJ KACHORI was okayish. The burst of flavours was missing for me. The CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA PIZZA is one outstanding chicken pizza. Loved the juicy chicken chunks seasoned well. Highly recommend this. GINGER CHICKEN MOMOS were a surprise in terms of the flavor. Absolutely loved the juicy chicken filling with a hint of ginger. Definitely coming back for this!THE ALOO PARANTHA was the STAR DISH for me. Honestly wasn't expecting a...read more

This place is highly recommended.Sweet place...................................................................................................................................................................."
4841,I mean this place doesn't deserve to be rated... I'm sorry guys but your supposed dress code policy doesn't even have sandals ( not slippers but leather sandals) allowed them go check your whereabouts... Keeping a name so casual and then being so formal in your policies... Get a life.... There are almost 100 cafe in CP...
4842,A really good place to enjoy your weekdays as well!! Located in the outer circle and easy to spot...!The interiors are soo pretty specially the LOCAL written!! Great ambience and good food. We ordered veggie lovers pizza and mushroom pizza. Their crusts were amazing thin and so crispy! Thin crust pizza fans should surely try this place. Kick ass Honey chilly potatoes also tasted good though the quantity was less. Pink sauce pasta had little veggies and less quantity!Good music with good mood! Superb combo ..!Would surely visit this cafe again!
4843,The ambience is so good. Had a lot of fun with my friends. One of the good & happening restaurants in CP. Pretty good choices amongst dishes and drinks. 
4844,"I would say this is over hyped. Menu choice is too limited and what ever we ordered wasn't that great from pizza to drinks to stir fried noodles. Never ever imagined in stir fried noodles it can actually be Maggie and not noodles. Staff doesn't know what we can order if ask for help, it takes them too long to understand that we need a menu to order. Decor is good and ambience is really nice, no doubt. Found it really expensive, for 4 pax without alcohol bill was Rs. 4,772/- (this does include Hukkah). "
4845,I ordered peri peri pasta and veg momos over there.. The taste was worst.. Will not visit again.. Staff is rude as well.. Orders took more than 30 minutes to come.. Music was not good
4846,"Ambiance, light and music was good. The food was delicious. I ordered panner tikka masala, chicken tikka, Hummus pita, murgh malai. The food was great but was a little delay in serving. Overall the experience was great and would be looking up to dine again."
4847,"Ambience is nice but need to improve a lot on food quality. I have been there once and frankly not planing to visit again. To start on with firstly we were 6 people and they offered us a very small table with two extra chairs on asking them to change it they said we are overbooked, but many of the tables were unoccupied. Then came the order two dishes were served when we were almost done and was about to ask for the bill upon that they gave us one dish which was not ordered so we returned it.

4852,The ambience is pretty nice..not a place to get clicked..but yes you can click pictures outside of it.Food is not so amazing.Just okay in taste.
4853,"Local would be my current first pick if I had to go anywhere around CP. Why? Just for that package.Good music, good crowd, good vibes, good food and the prices would make any college student happy. Bored of going to Social but going anywhere else doesn't give you a 100% satisfaction? Then local is the only answer. I had chhole bhature, vada paav, Biryani and even golgappe, the taste is not extraordinary, but it definitely fulfulls all your craving. When it's the booze game they have the whole sale concept which is marvellous. Almost at MRP and the crowd is elite. The staff is courteous and the overall feel is perfect here.

It was exactly that and we absolutely loved it! The ambience was great, It's quite spacious! Even the outdoor area was very bright and picturesque. It's a perfect place to hang out with friends or family. You can either go in the day time or at night, you will only have fun, I promise!

But with the fast lifestyle it is not practical most of the time to indulge this way. Keeping this in mind a lot of eating places are surfacing offering the authentic street food in comfortable upscale and lavish settings.And that‚Äôs exactly what we did when we visited a newly opened restaurant serving authentic and traditional local cuisines in the famous CP area of New Delhi.

And servicing is fast. Overall good experience. Visiting again soon."

4868,"Local has truly come up like a gem in the middle of the good ol' CP. Interestingly, it has a standalone location in the outer circle, far from the crowd of other restaurants. I can put my money on my fact that this is one of the biggest restaurants in CP. The massive circular shaped ground floor is so big that it has also accommodated a special sheesha section with a totally different theme on one corner. On the other hand, there's also an upper floor bordering the corners of the one below, making the place looking even bigger.

Well i must say everything was pathetic in taste and while sitting the staff kept on asking for getting a cheque even when we were eating food. I was done at the starters itself and could'nt have lunch there. Never go in ""THE LOCAL"" if you wanna spend a great time with friends."

4898,"With the opening of upmarket pubs, resto bars and lounges, delhi's night life has begun perking up. Heart of delhi has got its newest resto bar for the glitterati and the young.

4901,"There are reasons for me to give 4 rating to a potential 5 rating place, and that is the high price for liquor other than beer and poor choice of music. Had Heineken Draught beer for myself and wine and vodka for my friend. That is why the bill shot up. Ordered Chilly Chicken, Anchari Paneer Tikka and Honey Chilli Potato. All were good except potatoes were not cooked properly, but hey it doesn't hurt. A great place to have beer and snacks. And yeah the music was not that interesting. Need little bit of work there. ¬†But I must point out that service was really good. And the ambiance is awesome !!!! Full marks there. :)"

I called at 2pm today to make a reservation and spoke to a girl called Myra who enquired about the no. of people and confirmed my reservation. Much to my shock, on reaching there with a group of 11 employees for celebrating a farewell, we were denied entry because apparently they don't allow stag entries and only couples are allowed.

The two floors huge space with the amazing lightning and DJ console in the centre creating the ambiance outstanding. From the aperitifs till dessert everything was yum. Cocktails, mocktails and shots were amazing. Got chance to get served by Pradeep and I must say the great hospitality by him.Thankyou very much Miss Karishma for treated us nicely and made our occasion memorable.

A spacious place where evenings get better with the time, one doesn't want to miss. The food served here is good with all the flavours intact and the staff was very courteous.  The best thing I liked was their personalised service and attempt to make it an awesome experience. Go for some awesome evening and great time to LoCaL!.."

While on the booking we were told that they dont allow the stags entry, which is such a disgrace to the industry that they rationalise. I did not mean that these policies are baseless, but i think that industry should allow stags on profile basis. Today is the time where management makes it own rules - Right to reserve admission, but no one knows when the regulations get the tables turned like service charges.So now you will say that you are still charging service charges let me clarify you being a legal tax expert, the transactions are being entered by restaurant and customer, where restaurant acts as an...read more"

4930,I visited  this place for dinner with friend on a Monday. Local cp is a grand corner property and easily attracts your attention. The ambience would be more happening  during the night.the  concept of this restroom is the present regular food items in innovative forms though I felt the prices were I bit too high.The menu is conceptualised around  local delicacies.Excellent service from staff.. Thumps up for allspecially thanks Krishma she helped us all our meal
4931,"Worst place to visit. P. S- its not always the food, its also about the place or people who bring up a normal place as an extraordinary place. The people are so negative who work there and the bouncer who stand outside are so rude that one will not feel like going in. They behavior is such as u will feel that they are doing a favor by allowing you to go in. My experience was very bad,  the place is big but the people who are running it have very negativity approach. "
4932,"I am usually not very keen on ordering Indian street food at restaurants. A very obvious reason being lack of authentic flavours and the unnecessary glamification of these dishes. However, the newly opened Local promises you no-nonsense, restaurant quality Indian street food {among other things} at an impressive price point and also lives up to that promise. They've got a massive space, bang in the middle of CP on KG Marg and it's nearly impossible to miss it while driving through the outer circle."
4933,Bad management. Poor service. Table was available still had to wait outside 20 minutes before getting the entry. Irrational policies made by the management. People were rejected on the basis of their clothing. Over priced sheesha.
4934,"Local is one happening place in CP, the interiors are well designed and has a happy vibe.¬†They serve mostly local delhi food like Gol gappe, Momos, Raj kachori but also our basic party food nachos, pizzas and pastas.

4936,Nice place to hang out with friends . Been there with my friend and trued out their local shots. They were cheap and wonderful. The food was also relishing. They had good music and hospitable staff. Hope to be there soon again .
4937,The restaurant decor was nice but the music playing was pretty sub standard. The chicken tikka was juicy and the cosmopolitan was lip smacking. the sandwiches were too cheesy though.
4938,"Local in Connaught Place is the new kid on the block. It is a massive restaurant with plethora of seating arrangement. The place is done in a studio way and has an eclectic ambience with peppy tunes playing to set you in a perfect mood to party. The centre of the restaurant has huge screens showcasing the latest of music videos. This place is going to be a big hit among the regular party goers. The menu features a lot of local dishes from Mumbai and they are pretty good at it. While I was at it I relished the Angrezi Chicken Burger, Pao Bhaji, Chicken Momos and Veg Spring Rolls. The burger had grilled juicy chicken patty with melted cheese sanwiched between two huge pieces of buns and...read more"
4939,"When you have so much competition around, specially in a place like Connaught place, it becomes difficult to stand out. Local stood out for me because of its great theme and ambience which makes it quite happening even around day time, but it's got one of the most enterprising and professional staff I've seen around. Specially want to highlight Karishma, who's great with her recommendations and ensuring smooth service to the table (chilli chicken and mango shots are great), Nidhi for taking extra care for us at the table and Deepak who put up a great show for us at the bar with his innovative shots. Highly recommended place if you're heading to central Delhi for chilling!"
4940,"Went to local for a lunch cz hearing alot about it these days. The ambience was really nice, had a lounge like feeling at noon time as well. I ordered kick ass honey chilli potato and it's taste justifies it's name because they really were kick ass with sufficient quantity. Then I ordered triple cheese Italian Lasagne, it was really cheesy and had a tangy taste. The service was fast as well so overall I had a good experience and can come here again. "
4941,"This place offers good food, good ambience and great service to start with but a dull menu doesn't let you browse through much amusing dishes. The place is nice, huge and a little dark in the afternoons but the lighting at night makes it look very vibrant and classy. I tried honey chilli potato which had a nice and crisp flavor and lasagne which didn't look very great but it tasted amazing as what matters.The service was quick and the staff was nice and friendly. Everything bieng great about the place with a little here and there over the place. "

The serving size is not that good, but the food tastes amazing!!!!If you are done with Tamasha, MTV Flyp etc. Do give this place a chance.Cheers!!!!!"
4972,"It's a huge bar and that's about it! The service doesn't really match up to the level of expectations one can have after entering the place. The food taste doesn't compensate either. We ordered chicken fingers, Afghani chicken, nachos, and garlic bread and none of the dishes stood even close to being rated 5 on 5. The hookah wasn't grand either. Adding to all of that, the DJ was by far the worst I have experienced in the cardinal location of Delhi.. To summarize, kindly avoid!"
4973,Lovely ambience and great food. The server Mansi was very polite. The music could be better. We had veggie lover pizza which was worth the money.
4974,Probably the best place to hangout and staff really helpful and friendly ... special mention Mansi khanna probably the best person around and help me n my partner all the evening.....big thumbs up
4975,if u really love exotic indian food  wid some indian street bites i would prefer to visit this place again n again ....moreover i found staff was amazing like vishal n gourav  i already met this gys at HRC new delhi   ... they suggest me something n i love it..... ü§òü§òüëåüëå

4977,"Second visit to this place. Really disappointed with the food and service. Hookah was not at all good. Ordered hummus pita- just not good, chilly paneer- was just okay and one of my friend wanted to have aloo tikki- had a bite and had to return it because it seemed stale and cold.Previous visit was still better but would really think twice before recommending this place."
4978,"I went with my friends  to the restaurant yesterday  it was well serverd experience  there food and drinks  was on time, service is great Sanjay my table polite and accurate.ambience so nice. It was outstanding  place cp. I am visiting  again my group ."

Keeping in mind, that I went in the initial days, I understand the run for achieving the perfection in food, however, most of the dishes served on the table were quite fantastic.

4996,Amazing place ...had a party there staff is very hospitable special thanks to their manager Nitin for hospitality.Would Recomend ever1to try out once. Mr komal service was excellent 
4997,"Visited on 15th August. Had a really bad experience with the servers and with the Hookah. Servers were very rude to say the least. We ordered Pizzas, Paneer Roll, Hookah to start with and we had to end it here as the servers notified us after 20 minutes that they won't be able to serve Pizza. Hookah was one of the worst in Delhi. Paneer roll (or whatever it is that they call it) was however edible."
4998,"The name says Local but i bet u would be stunned with this gigantic place in front of u with the dj console in the centre n a special place for smokers to chill, eat food n have ur drinks. Hookah lovers wont be disappointed too.. Suggestions as follows :-1) Mix sauce pasta2) peri peri chicken pizza3) Local Shots (limelight) 4) Mushroom Mattar with lachha parantha. (Indian Delicacy) Suggested by a very humble manager Karishma, she helped us all throughout our meal. **visited last sunday. "

5000,The food was good but the ambience was average and the music was way too loud and boring. It was not disco music just boring songs played louder than necessary. They can do much better with the music. Service is good though. Pravesh and deep
5001,"A huge place in cp which can accommodate 1500 people at a time, it has already created much hype in delhi , though the place is beautifully done , interiors are pretty cool . But the food is average here. We ordered spring rolls , nachos , noodles , pizza and pasta , out of which only pav bhaji was okayish. The drinks were fine though. One time visit place."

5010,"Amazing place, fine service, delicious food....the music is awesome.. Good place to hangout with friends.................. Keep rocking guys.... "
5011,"Didnt have a good time, as the food was not that good, customer service was horrible.Place was not good, staff is very very bad, way too arrogant, staff asked me 500 rs bribe for change of hooka, other guy didnt tell me complimentary breads with veggies, made me ordered twice the bread for 2 couples. service is very slow. had to repeat for things a lot of times. cutlery & utensils are way too local.i wont recommend at all.Name defines the place: LOCAL"
5012,Amazing place food is awesome and DJ TOO..Best served : Thank Deepaküòä for the wonderful service.... enjoyed a lot ...Friends birthday party New place at cp
5013,Mr vishal so called manager came to talk when he was stinking of smoke. Had to request him to stand and talk cause it was unbearable. Where does something like this happens?? 360 ml of whisky is served with 100 ml of club soda. How is it possible to have that much alcohol with so less club soda. Ok agreed club soda is paid but where in the menu is club soda priced. But aerated drink is for 85 rupees but we were charged 35 rs for a printed soda price of 18 rs. That calls for a complaint to customer court. I will surely go ahead and go with it. 
5014,"The latest entry in this segment, coming up with the concept of ""Drink Dil Kholke"". They believe in the saying ""The more, the merrier"", this place will not burn a hole in your pocket if you place a bulk order and gives you great deals on wholesale order.Excellent place for a group party and even if you are someone with a good capacity. Pocket friendly is one of its USP."
5015,"One of the newest restaurants in CP, Local is a very versatile, decent & comfortable restaurant. It is located at Scindia house. It is spread across a HUGE area and offers different options of seating as per your needs. The highlight is the four-side screen around the DJ. It reminds me of the centrals screens in NBA basketball stadiums. The music is great here. And the staff is very well trained and professional. Very humble, professional and helpful too. Service was great."
5016,"A place that can offer you all the options from food to the partying disco lights and spacious evening so you should definitely try local situated on Connaught circus.It‚Äôs very reachable and easy to find because it's situated on main road.So this place is huge,a nice one for party poopers.I went there with my friends.The staff was little amateur but I liked the ambiance of the place.The dim lights and spacious seating arrangement along with comfortable sofas would relieve all the stress that you've gathered throughout your week.I ordered:Kashmiri kesar Dahi ke kebab:they were really delicious.Soft and crispy at the same time.I loved the green dip which was offered with...read more"

5020,"Do you like savoring Street Food? I am sure it‚Äôs yes from most of you. I too love relishing them in their locale surroundings on the streets. But with the fast lifestyle it is not practical most of the time to indulge this way.

They have a nice menu with almost all the items we think of while eating outside in a restaurant.It's located at Scindia house at the end of KG Marg right opposite the Junkyard cafe, parking is the only issue because of its location so I would suggest to park it at the Scindia house parking or below Junkyard cafe.

Ordered chilli cheese toast, thela chowmein with some drinks. Everything was a delight ,but this place doesn't have much options for the vegetarians. Decor and ambience is a thumbs up. A must visit on the weekends sometime."

5045,The menu is very interesting and the place is set up quite brilliantly. The staff seems a bit amateurish and the food was mostly great. But paneer tacos were really disappointing. Overall for the set up with huge screens in the middle and the concept they deserve another chance and just hope they improve on the few things that keep them from being extraordinary 
5046,by far the best place ive visited in delhi! chilled out place ... amazing variety of alcohol ... the food tastes bomb...moreover the staff is so friendly and helpful...especially Karishma the manager! shes an awesome host and organiser !!! must visit for everyone .. surely my hot fav in Delhi!

The kind of floor space they have ensures that you will have a space to yourselves, whether it be a date or just chilling with a group of friends.The menu is quite extensive with a number of options in food and beverages to suit everyone's liking. I can't name any one thing that is good, only because everything is! The service here is great, just ask for Jagdish. He'll ensure you don't wait too long for anything.The ambience here is great. Just the perfect lighting with good music. There's ample seating so don't worry about waiting. Great crowd.All in all, great deal!Cheers!"
5060,"A new kid on the block. The location surely takes advantage as it has got huge seating space. The ambience / cutlery is influenced from Social, so are the prices. You might get a feel of Haldiram by looking at their menu's first page ;) The food tastes just average and prices are decent (quantity is per prices only). You can give it a try for relatively cheap alcohol and food. The staff is just ok when it comes toCourtesy (we weren't allotted a table for 7 even after requesting for hours, ended up accommodating by joining 2 tables). Get your table reserved on the weekends."
5061,Really good place. Had a good time. Our Server Gopal Sagar was particularly courteous and nice. Paao bhaaji was amazing. The music and the ambience was really good. The variety in hookah is really good. I went with my friends and had a really good time. The prices are affordable as well. All in all a good place! 
5062,Amazing ambience!! Nice people ! Liked the staff ! Would love to come back again all the time.. Karishma and vishal are amazing and made our time more worth it. Appreciate their cooperation. Food is just astonishing. This made my weekend really worth it.

Just the place is too big and you can come in big groups and enjoy without much waiting. The biggest problem is parking. There is no proper place nearby and they don't offer Vallet parking as well which is much chaotic in weekends for anyone going.We ordered tacos which were very normal and not much of taste, Garlic bread too was very dry. Though we liked dal makhni and naan.."

5072,"good food at fair value. order burgur, sandwich and kababs, and all good taste and very light after eating. can take children also, very nice environment."
5073,"Visited this place on Wednesday afternoon with my friends. Being a weekday and afternoon the place was not packed and the music was also light and soothing. The best thing about this place is it's interiors. The ambience is wonderful and the place is very huge. They have given a vintage yet sophisticated look. It is actually very classy. On the other hand, it standa by it's name- Local. The flavors of the food and the crockery were kind of raw. It did justice to it's name. The dishes were decent enough. However, the drinks were amazing,especially Caramel coffee and Red wine sangria. Pan fried noodles had a 'desi' taste which was kind of amazing. Out of all the dishes ordered, the only...read more"
5074,"Now this the place where i will suggest everyone to go for. Perfect ambience,  spacious, beautiful decor and their whole team is very cooperative. We went their  last Saturday. We had ordered humus and peeta and chicken wings basket. Food is quiet tempting. Music is also good. Most importantly prices are minimal so if you are looking for some amazing place without hampering your pockets, one should definately go there. üòäüòä"
5075,Place where you feel special 'the food was sooooo tempting specially fish burgers and staff was very friendly thanks to vishal the manager ..he is tooo good
5076,"Went to this place on a Saturday night. We were told at the entrance that there is a waiting of about 45 mins and will have to wait at the bar to which we agreed. However, to our surprise when we entered we saw that there were many unoccupied tables and we were given a table immediately. Though the ambience is good but food is not upto the mark. We had to change our order for drinks thrice as what what was mentioned on the menu was not available. Dahi kabab were too less in quantity and tasted bad. Chilli cheese toast were crisp and tasty. Chicken tikka was average. Overall, the food that they serve is way too average in taste and service too slow."
5077,"A beautifully done place, with alot of varieties and variations, with a complete feel of local food in a luxury way!The taste of food ü•ò goes well through expectations, the best things out of all were parantha with makhan, shakes, sangria, gol gappee.Comfortable space.Easily accessible, and you can take sit in different areas, with variations if seats and a different way of screening, this place goes will and is not that expensive.A hygienic local hub is now here!.A must visist!"

5081,Most impressed with vishal( the manager) took such good care of us. Will come back soon üòä. Chicken tikka was awesome and so was the drinks üçπ 
5082,This newly opened cafe in CP caught our attention with its name 'Local'. Though the ambience was very nice but I didn't find it matching with the name of the cafe. The place is quite spacious with different types of seatings and you can choose from them according to your comfort. They also have a separate smoking section. I went there to celebrate my friend's birthday and were quite happy with our experience there. We just could not get a place to dance as we were there in the afternoon. Anyhow the music being played was good. We ordered some food and it was nice. A little bit costly but definitely worth trying. The service was quick. The staff was also quite helpful and humble.

5085,"Brilliant place. Very spacious. Excellent food service. It was my wives bday and this place made it extra special. There is a guy by the name of Dildaar, his service is amazing.

5091,"Latest addition to the sprawl of resto-bars at CP. Love the ambience and the huge seating arrangements, each with a different level of comfort (as per one's choice). Ordered for beer and parsley fish finger (got over before I could click pics).The portions were pretty unfulfilling but I liked how crispy n tasty it was. Our first batch was a tad bit salty but Karishma and Nitin got us a fresh batch. Chef Gautham was kind enough to come to our table to check on us and Rakesh who waited our table was super proactive.

5092,Went there with my lovely gang on a wednesday night. I must say the food and the service was great. Especially Mr Nitin and Ms Karishma (Managers) Mr Rajesh Thakur (server) and the most important person Mr Gautam chef personally came to our table and made sure we had a good time.
5093,"The name of the place has been rightly chosen...as you will find all sorts of food which is available in the well known food joints in Delhi yet this one with a little twist. Had their Chilli chicken,pizza's and railways wala mutton  accompanied by butter naan. Their naan was so mouth watering that we need to ask for an extra portion of it. The mutton were too mouth watering and suggest you to give it a try. As a wholesale bar, we can select any drinks which are not even close to expensive but it was quite memorable dine out.

5098,This newly opened cafe serves a great deal of food.Perfect place for some good maagie and we had some good time due to our host Mansi. Must visit to a have a good time.
5099,I visited Local last weekend and I m glad to write this review. I really appreciate the service and response that I got from the floor manager and the ground staff. ¬†Food and Ambiance too has impressed me a lot. Will visit this place again.
5100,"We were looking for a new place to go to in CP and that's when we found local. Btw interesting logo. Went with friends on a Friday night, had good crowd, good music and its a really big place. You can definitely go with a big group of friends. We ordered paneer tikka and it was very average. The soya chaap was really bad and was completely dry. And the mezze platter was decent, not bad. Overall it was average. "
5101,"LOCAL, CPWent to Local CP yesterday with a friend of mine as the weather was superbly amazing! üòâTo be very true this was not the first time I was hearing about Local, CP and it was due for me to visit this restaurant since a very long time. Finally I was super happy and excited that I was visiting here and that too with one of my best friend. This restaurant is quite visible as soon as one enters Kasturba Gandhi Marg because of its giant hoarding. I took my seat and as usual, my friend was late so I decided to look at their drinks menu and to order something for myself in the meantime. What I saw that unlike other places in CP, they're the only one who've confidently written about...read more"
5102,"Celebrated my Independence Day here üòâso yaa I couldn't try their cocktails but their mocktails was average okayish..Like we all know Connaught Place you hardly have huge clubs so count this in as one of the gigantic and LIT place.Place is spread across 2 floors (ground and first) and have pretty terrace too, place can accommodate 200 pax easily, so yaa you can plan your private parties here.Over all food was good, cuisines I suggest for vegetarian is Soya malai tikka and pan fried noodles with veggies saut√©ed in spicy sauce.Food - 3.5/5Service - 3.5/5Value for money - 4.5/5Considering locality, ambiance and food one must try..I would recommend this for private parties."
5103,"Well as I heard about there atmosphere it was nice. But coming to good quality it's pathetic we ordered chicken pizza in which I beleive we hardly found chicken and when we complaint to steward he just ignored and went back. Not only this in terms of drink they have huge variety of menu but when you ordered you will hardly find the one of your selection, infact if you ask the steward he is also not aware of it and took long time to revert. However the steward suggested to ordered their ""Bharat Italian Chicken Wings"" trust me I have never had such pathetic wings ever. They charge you very high price but In terms of quantity it's poor. If you want to spend such money should be...read more"
5104,One of the good things that happen in CP is that its amazing cafe's gets updated with more crazier cafe's and one of the latest addition to the list is this cafe üòª It is one of the roomiest cafe of CP with an amazing ambience and great music üï∫üèº My suggestion would be to prebook the place as one could have to wait outside as it is mostly jampacked ü§ûüèª
5105,Very bad experience ..i was there on last sunday i.e 20 aug 2017...we were total 7 people but they had given us table for 4 n promised that ..later on they will provide the place for 7...but this didnot happened..n food quality was also not up to mark...i will not suggest this to anyone...
5106,Don't have option for giving negative points. .newly opened outlet that behave like out of world lounge. Stags are not allowed in weekdays even if you've from corporates . Don't know how long they can servive in CP with such a bad attitude in city like Delhi and connought place where majority of corporates are located... 
5107,Corporates are not allowed to enter just because stag entry restricted.that too on monday. . Don't know what they want. It is acceptable if its weekend but on weekdays a big NO. 
5108,"Really liked the place. The vibe and the atmosphere. Went here on a Sunday for lunch with a friend. The place is nice to spend some good time. The food is also good. Couldn't try much of their dishes, just had the arrabiata pasta. Trust them when the server mentions you that it's spicy. We took him lightly but in fact it was very much spicy! Would be visiting them soon :) "
5109,So Local is the new lounge in CP! We expected alot from this place but were quite disappointed. First of all they serve herbal hukkas!! Like seriously?! I really didn't like the food also. We ordered white sauce pasta and mumbai paneer aloo samosa chaat which was average. Sandwich was toasted but only had tomatoes in it nothing else. They MUST increase their food quality since they have a great ambience. 3 stars just for the quick service and ambience. 
5110,"Hey I went to this place yesterday night, the ambience the DJ, space and all were very nice, however the food which was not upto the mark.-Most of the items in the menu were not available be it kathi roll, pizza or infact choice of beer. - we finally ordered some tacos with onion rings which was average and there were no onion rings and i don't know why but me and my friend both have sour throat after eating that. - Pasta was not cooked properly (the penne was raw) i informed the waiter about the same but he did not do anything. "
5111,"This restaurant is located in CP. The ambiance of the place is done up well. The interiors are really nice. The seating is pretty spacious too. I was with my friends when I went there and we ordered : Honey Chilli Potato, Cheese Penne Pasta, Paneer Tikka Tacos along with Cranberry Juice and Peach Syrup.The beverages were awesome however the food could be a bit better.Just one complaint - service was a bit slow on the day we dined in.Rest its a nice place one can definitely give it a try."
5112,This 1 star is only for the ambience.....after waiting for around 10 minutes we got the place at the first floor. In order to make ourselves comfortable we chose to siton the sofa seats but we were asked to sit on the seats with chairs since were only 3. this is something I have never seen at any restaurant ever. then we again waited for 10 minutes and nobody came to either serve us water or to give us the menu to decide....so we chose to leave the place.Highly irresponsible and uncourteous staff. Very disappointing. 
5113,"This place rocks, The food is very flavorful and when you order your food spicy, it delivers. You'll want to share your food for a more authentic experience. Also, the vibe is really interesting"
5114,"Place is very spacious with nice ambience. Food is delecious. Had dim sums ,bada pav ,pita & hummus , dal makhani. Hookah is great too. Staff is friendly and service is great."
5115,"The staff is very negligent. I ordered 4 pints of beer, after 20 mins another wait came in and I told him that i had already placed an order. After another 10 mins another waiter came in and I told him the same thing but this time I told him the name of the beer. Then I was informed that the beef was not available. Out of like 8 beers listed in the menu just 3 were available. Out of which 2 had a price which you can say was quite the opposite of ""wholesale"". All this while, the staff kept poking us to change table as we were just 2 and the table was for 4 people. I saw the staff doing the same to other people. Even the manager himself came in to ask me to change the table. To...read more"

5118,Very impressed with the concept of this place.It's huge plus really different concepts of the DJ console in the centre of the space which is giving it a nightclub feel.Food was very nice and good testThey have coloured shots for Rs. 45
5119,Great ambience however service is too poor. Management is extremely rude. I asked for a glass of water after placing my order and there was some strange smell in water. The same was highlighted to a gentleman in blue suit( seemed like the manager). He without acknowledging the complaint took the glass and placed a bottle of mineral water on the table. That was too rude. Servers kept forgetting our drinks orders again and again. Had to remind them and it was a bit frustrating. I asked for a draught beer and the server said its not available so we ordered another round of drinks. After half an hour we we asked for the same draught beer it was available... strange... all and all not a good...read more

5121,"Recently opened new cafe at CP. Excellent ambience. Very spacious. Two floor sitting plus vip sitting. Service is good. Live screening. Tables are too small. If four guys sitting on table and order 4 items, you haven't that much space to keep food on table. Very limited variety of food. Quality food is good. Mocktails are okk. For those who drink, guys so many brands of whiskey, vodka, rum, beer. Personally, I didn't enjoy that much with my friends. Only one time cafe.."

Music was Fuddu for a sat. night till 11.30pm and after that it was only a B+ only."
5123,"We are planning to throw a party of 50 people so we decided to check Local's menu and talk to the manager once to book the place however the staff on the entrance is very bad we understand they were full but the staff denied to show the menu that too very rudely. I will never recommend a place with such bad hospitality, you are loosing customers"
5124,"As the name suggests it's a LOCAL place. Just huge but LOCAL. Didn't have all the whiskeys in stock as mentioned in menu. Ordered wholesale whiskey but didn't serve in packed bottle. Didn't have all the beers mentioned in menu. In fact had only Budweiser. That too not cold enough. Beer buckets were out of stock. For food we ordered pizza, nachos, chowmein, malai Chaap, chakhna platter, pasta and chilli potatoes. Pizza and chakhna platter was best.

5125,"Totally digged this place! A huge establishment in the heart of the city. This is where Delhi's old charm meets modern rustic chaos, given city's rocky history displayed across the whole space. Here you can gulp down mouth watering spirit shots at jaw dropping prices!The service team is efficient enough to cater to the huge influx of delhi janta, even on a Saturday night!The food is presented well and is sumptuous enough to later drool over. With such an exquisite food and beverage offerings, this super cool space will give a neck to a neck competiton to the other up scale pubs. "

5130,Amazingly huge space in CP.The concept is really different. The food waa good too. Very different names on the menu.Coming back here again for sure.
5131,Such an amazing place with tasty food & Really good service.The concept is never-seen-before.would come back again n again for sure.Highly Recommended
5132,Went there with a friend to check out the food and drinks. this place opener with much gusto. We ordered a few beers and vodka with tonic water. Nachos and paneer tikka tacos. Nothing new on the menu. Verg highly priced food ans drinks. Below average food. Discourteous staff. They asked us to leave the table as soon as we were done with the alcohol and told us that we can sit at the table as long as we are ordering something. Never going back there again. Gobar your own risk.
5133,"A real travesty!! Local has good ambience, design is refreshing, not cramped - but the staff is more than competent in ruining your experience. The waiters are very courteous, but it's the mid level management - like the gentleman in a black suit (that urgently needs drycleaning) standing at the entrance.¬†At the very entrance you would be made to feel obliged for even being considered for entering the joint. My friends had been waiting for me inside, so I sought to rush into the club.

5134,"Huge place with NO TASTENo doubt this is one of the huge lounge in CP with an awesome location but definitely they need to change their chef asap.Ambience is awesome but not able to find even a single dish which is mouth watering or even worth mentioning.Sheesha too was like without any flavor and it seems more like exhaling smoke only.Staff seems to be in learning phase but will give them full marks as they try to do everything in best possible way.I believe management needs to understand ambience, music and location needs to be excellent but one thing which will bring back people will be tasty food only."
5135,"Well the place is huge! So points for ambience and location. But the food isn't good. I went with a friend,  ordered baked nachos and white sauce pasta which are pretty basic food items, nothing fancy. But even these were bland without any flavour. Nachos were soggy and pasta was too dry. The service and staff is good though! May be a one time try cafe but won't go again."
5136,Dis is a huge place with a dance floor almost in between...Proper place to dance n party hard...Even alcohol is not so costly..Has a nice bar section..Serves hookah..D food is equally delicious...Totally recommended place...For groups n all..
5137,"I visited the place yesterday for a friend's birthday treat. Unlike our expectations, the place isn't as it is potrayed on social media. Worst thing was hookah. It was plain and a total wastage of money. Pizza was still fine. But then the red sauce pasta was pathetic. It was undercooked and too dry. We asked them to get it fixed. They repeated the order and it was all the same! Only good thing is that it's spacious and has a good feel to the overall place! Lot of improvement is required guys! All the best!"

He went back, at 9:00 a third waiter came with something else again told him this isn't our order, he went back.

The place is located at one of the most prime properties and is spread over a huge area with a very Monumental Feel attached to it. Keeping up with the ""Local"" theme, the utensils and the food both have an old world touch. We ordered-1. Achaari Paneer Tikka- sumptious chunks of Paneer (Cottage Cheese) marinated in sour cream and then roasted to perfection.2. Vegetable Pan Fried Noodles- mainstream taste of regular pan fried noodles more towards the spicier side.3.

Simple decor and comfortable seating.Food is not worth the money at all. We ordered Italian chicken wings which had gone wrong majorly.

5157,"After hearing from a friend about the astonishing cafe, I pressurised my cousins to have a sitting over here .As I was the one having extremist expectation it turn out to be opposite of all.Confirming it's name with its value as ""LOCAL""On the entrance I was said that the cafe was full and I have to wait for some time to get a sitting but when I asked them to let me check the ambience , I founded ""N"" no.

5158,"Ambience is a plus, unfortunately the food doesnt do justice to the place. We ordered chicken tikka masala, chicken ravioli and hummus with pita. Pita bread with hummus was the only plus on food. For drinks we ordered sukha anar, flavoured ice tea and khatta pudina (all non alcoholic drinks) which were also okay in terms of flavour. I would however appreciate the service, they are a courteous and welcoming group."
5159,"Lo‡§ï‡§≤ is not really Local..Its awesome place to visit..Go with friends, family & Lovers..Very good place for parties.There is 2 floor first floor is really Beautiful..Food, Shisha & drinks all good..If you are Delhites then you have to visit once."
5160,"So Local, CP it is. Was eagerly waiting to visit this new extensive place in town. Local, the wholesale bar in the heart of Delhi has already shown its charm with exquisite interiors, place and superb ambience.This place with great lightning & awesome DJ console place creates a next level craze in the crowd. The music was really good.The food was the only thing which I found disappointing. The presentation was good but the management really needs to work on the menu, flavours and aftertaste. This colossal place should add some more appealing items to the menu, and chef some more effort on the flavour. But from the items I ordered, I liked peri peri chicken pizza & tandoori chicken, &...read more"

Highly recommended by F4FoodChattur ¬†Foodie .What an uplifting place ...A priceless gem!!This place was on my bucket list for a long time. Finally it got down from there into my frequently visiting places' list. Never could have imagined the excellent party hub which exists in this world if I wouldn't have gone here. Next time our gang would fill the outdoor terrace for a private events.

5162,Management does not allow stag entry even on Mondays. It's not even that it was the weekend or there was a long waiting. I mean they've recently opened and that's how they are treating potential customers then this isn't the place to go whether a stag or a couple 
5163,My friend suggested we check this new place out in CP since there was lot of buzz around it.Experience was very disappointing.  Cocktails were bad. Non vegetarian starters were very decent.  Mango Shots @45 and spring rolls were the only positives. Place is spacious but not supported by food and drinks. Wouldn't really give it another visit unless something new comes up here. 
5164,Have been there last Sunday ...it's near KG Marg road outer circle cp... Ambience was huge and nice... Service by was good although food quality and quantity was nt that good .. ordered chilli honey patato ..which was too sweetCheese loaded nachos was ok okN shakes was average tooMusic n dj was good...

5166,"The best party place I have visited in a long time. The ambiance,  the food and the innovative cocktails just blows you away.  Make sure you visit the place at KG Marg,  just opposite N Block and very much visible to anyone who passes by. "
5167,"This newly opened place in CP has created a hype in the market & I had to check it out.Visited on  a Saturday Afternoon & the place was packed. After waiting for 5-10 mins, we finally sat & ordered.The food was delicious, the service was flawless & the ambience was very pleasant & lively.Definitely worth the wait."

5170,Huge space in CP.. one that's never seen before.The variety of food is fabulous. Interiors are very well thought of.The place is something that's unusual & had to be visited at least once

5173,"Local cp , a new entrant in the restaurant hub of delhi , Cp is a massive place with impeccable interiors and great food , this place has already created hype in the city. The place gives you the vibe for a party place ! The food was decent in taste and drinks were okayish . All in all a decent place to hang out with your pals‚úåüèª"
5174,"Absolutely hated this place. We were having a reunion of sorts and were waiting for our friend to arrive. He mistakenly wore slippers and wasn't allowed in. When we asked for 15 minutes to let us finish the food that we had already ordered, we were replied to in a rude tone. When asked to see the rule book regarding the slippers thing and pointing out that there was another group wearing slippers we were told that they were allowed cause they had ONE girl and we were 3 stags. When probed further, they simply said that club rules apply and they reserve the right to admission and mind you all this happened at around 4 pm so it wasn't exactly lit then. All of this could've been resolved had...read more"

5177,I went to Local yesterday (11th August 2017) along with 8 friends.They have to improvise a lot in many fields.1. The place has low lights which makes it difficult to click pics (even for the official photographer)..Lighten up guys2. The DJ should lower down his ego and play songs that make people dance and NOT trance only..A new DJ is required3. The food should have a complete makeover.. The food does not compliment the drinks. Normal people don't have hard drinks with a pizza and popcorn...Variety is required4. Seating is good5. Service is excellent. People like Naqvi are polite and service guests really well6. The beefed up Guards at the entrance are not required.. They scare...read more

5179,Nice ambience...And perfect service by mr rakeshNeed to improve music Its is better then my bar headquarters I think youths can try this local bar
5180,"I decide to try LOCAL this time. A newly opened lounge in heart of Delhi- CP. Ambience was great of this place. Service staff was also good. The only and kind of a major issue was with food and drinks. Neither shake or mocktails were good nor the food was up to the mark. But if we ignore the above facts, than it's a great place to grab a drink at quite reasonable prices. "
5181,"The latest in the Connaught Place. Local is a place which has opened it gates for the masses. It's huge, probably 400-500 seater restaurant with a unique concept of wholesale with a style console in between. Those who drink a lot have to be regulars here to drink all the time."
5182,Poor service!Untrained staff...food was ok...reasonable pricing...Huge place ...but nothing special!Not at all recommended for your great weekend plans ! 
5183,"Awesome experience... Superb ambience... Taste and food quality superb... And the best of all... The buddy.. Pradeep,  the service guy... Awesome!! "
5184,"Last night it was my friend's birthday and we all decided to go to this place, dat I heard many good things about!The place is very easy to locate and is lit beautifully opposite Tamasha. The place is really big and nice. The staff is courteous and polite. When I asked the DJ of the night to announce my friends name for a birthday wish, he rudely said NO! Food: we ordered Loaded nachos, soya malai tikka, peri peri chicken pizza, crispy chicken, tandoori chicken and masala maggi.The food was good and decent enough.Music: nice!The place also has a smoking zone which is good for smokers!I must name, VISHAL, the manager was too cute and courteous ‚ù§"

5190,"This newly opened place in Cp was quite good. Food was very delicious but the quantity was very less. We order soya chaap, dahi ke kababs and it barely had 4 piece each. The waiters were courteous and sheesha was just amazing. Ambience was 3.5/5.  "

5195,"This place is right now one of the best places to party in Delhi. Perfectly located in the central part of CP, very hard to miss as its beautifully lit from the outside.The spot has the DJ placed bang in the middle and the whole restaurant/club around it. Also, the in house DJ is really good.The cocktails are super tasty and the food is great too.All in all it's a tough competition to places like Social, Soi7, etc.Pradeep was a great attendant. His service will be remembered. "
5196,"Went there on a Friday night with some of my friends. Just loved the place ( you will know what I am talking about once you see the place) The food was great, we ordered the Bachpan ki Maggie and Chicken Tikka, which were both great. The drinks were good too. In all it was a great experience and a recommended place for sure."
5197,"Tried aloo and pyaz ke parathe. They were so filling and yummy. Definitely gonna come back to try out other dishes. Coolest new place opened in cp. The service was good, will be visiting it soon. Cheers "
5198,"Loved the place and the ambiance. The space is quite huge, one of the biggest properties in CP. The DJ console is on a higher level (you need to visit the outlet to know what i am talking about) and plays trendy english songs. Loved the experience, will surely come back."
5199,Great place. The property is huge with beautiful interiors. The food was amazing. Had the chocolate shake it was so good that I ordered another one even after I was full. Should definitely check this place out.

Then we ordered bottled water And coke cans which mrp was 35rs/can/bottle but they charged us 95rs/can/bottle for it.

Good lights, abundant sitting options, awesome DJ table which is in centre playing some nice music and interior is worth to mention. They have two different menus according to time, till 6:30 pm prices of booze is comparatively less and then afterwards a little more.Tasted cheese loaded nachos which was good having cheese , kidney beans and cream on top of it and then tried veggie lover pizza which was disappointing in taste.

5202,I have been waiting for a place where i can see a huge crowd gathered in a single place. This place is a dream come true. You can do a festival here. Totally upgraded and international concept. The best part is the space they have. Because of the the dj cansole in the center. This place has huge space for to accommodate people. I really like the indoor smoking area as now you will not cut off from your party people. Really a good spacious place.

5213,Massive place on the corner of kg Marg.. Outer circle.. This place will catch your attention. The restaurant has two floors. Ambience is pretty descent.. Nothing flashy or elaborate. Was pretty packed to my surprise even on a weekday. Food was good and so were the prices. Looking to get a quick bite after work with your friends in the heart of the city.. This place will definitely give others a tough fight for business. 
5214,"Ok, yes this place is huge. Such a relief from those tiny cafes turned into clubs. They have a dress code of smart casuals so and that makes so much sense, why would people go clubbing in crocs or slippers. Kudos to the management for strictly enforcing it. The DJ is pretty amazing, he can judge the pulse of the crowd and play for them. He is a fan of Linkin Park, so when Numb came up was choking.. So we had their 8 bottles combo which is cheap and then we tried their 2.5 Lt. pitcher which was refreshingly quite nice. The beer was fresh..

5217,"Why to visit LOCAL:1. Service: Contrary to popular belief, their service was not that bad. When i was thinking to order sheesha/hookah, but concerned about the price (899+tax i.e. standard price in cp), service representative cordially suggested me sir you may not be able to enjoy it fully coz your friends are not taking it. Even the suggestions by other waiters were really good in terms of quantity and value to money food items. However, staff was less trained. The waiter whom i gave the first order was not the one whom i gave second and henceforth. Novice, docile and less organized.2. Ambience: I mean seriously this big with awestruck lightning exposure. That LOCAL in hindi with huge...read more"
5218,Interiors are new and flashy. But looks hurriedly finished. Service is awful. They have no idea who is to take the order. One of the waiters spilt drinks on my friend and never offered to apologise or compensate in anyway. The cocktails r just thrown together. No real art in it. Not worth the price. Ssly very bad customer service.

5222,Quality of food is very third class They serve you cold food Pita bread was very hard Please don't try the food Ambience is good Music was good 
5223,"Rating of 2 solely for the ambience, otherwise a big no if you‚Äôre expecting good service and food. Went there on a Friday night and was taken aback by the how big and beautifully decorated the place was. But the staff couldn‚Äôt manage anything. We ordered for two appetisers at 9:20PM and there was no sign of food on our table till 10:15. We were continuously asking them and they said the food is on its way. But at the end after talking to the manager, we found out that our order didn‚Äôt even reach the kitchen.If they are trying to make this place big, they should really do something about their service."
5224,"Huge place on KG Marg, CP. The interiors are so well thought of, execution is amazingly Done.The menu got us really excited as the names are unique & quirkyMust visit !!"
5225,Went there for the launch party and it was superb! The place is quite spacious with painting's of monuments in Delhi place in the upper level. The revolving DJ console is new and gives you the vibe for a party place. The wholesale bar concept lets you enjoy more drinks while you pay less. Highly recommend!

5244,This is a new place which opened last Saturday only. The ambience is different. This restaurant have a lot of seating space. The food is priced at a much cheaper rate. Alcohol are also priced at a very nominal rate. This place deserves a spot on your checklist. 
5245,Wish there were negative ratings. The place sucks big time. Service is really bad. Food is below average.One cannot hope for repeated customers just on the basis of ambience.

Not like other cafe‚Äôs or restro bar. The owner ( Mr. Tiwari) has really come out with a different output in the heart of the city. Bravo... food is good but what will attract u is the menu.. unique and clear. Had some momos and biryani with drinks. Nice food with different flavours.. not just usual but nice.
