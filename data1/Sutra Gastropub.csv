0,"The whole experience was amazing, loved the place, the ambience and the music was apt.Since I am a vegetarian I ordered tandoori aloo and it's a must try I loved how they served it in a different platter! The place is very hygienic, the people serving us wore a mask full time. If you're planning a visit make sure you sit on the roof, they have heaters too to make you feel warm and the rooftop vibe is different and amazing."
1,It was a lovely ambience pub. Food presentation was so pretty good. I love their chilli mushrooms & Daal Makhni. We have also enjoyed amazing live music performance.
2,"We had a memorable evening, one of best lounges in Cyber hub. The live band was awesome which added to the liveliness. Happy hours makes you more happy. Crunchy nachos & Tangy flavor of the peanut masala was awesome, must be due to some secret sauces they use. Always recommended for a fun-filled evening with friends and family"
3,This place has finest vibe. I loved the ambience and all interiors. This place is worthy for your Instagram shots. Every part is creative and unique. But food and drinks disappoint me.. first quantity is so poor according to the money. It is quiet very expensive on your pocket. Not a place for college crowd. But yess it is the place for date‚ù§‚ù§
4,"wandertastesaloni : I celebrated my birthday in Sutra. I chose this as it was newly opened and I am in love with the ambience üòç. If you are a photogenic person , choose this place for party with friends and loved ones. Its a pib with such a good decorations. The food and everything is fine ‚ù§"
5,Staff was courteous and ambience was really amazing
6,"Amazing food and ambience is to die for , best ambience ever!!"
7,I went with a couple of my friends on a Tuesday night and it was a ladies night. We heard the music from outside and it was really great. The DJ was cool too. The ambience and service was great. We mainly ordered starters and it was good.
8,"*Pre Lockdown Review*Pretty Looking place with extensive food menu. The ambience, service and everything was upto the mark. The drinks were the highlights, you can opt for any drink you like. I was amazed by the presentation on the food and the taste. Refer to the pictures. "
9,Ambience was supercool.Food tastes amazing.Mojito was refreshing.Loved their food platings.
10,Another one of my noida food adventures this place was discovered by chance and I must say the whole theme to the restaurant/cafe is quiet different and unique to be preciseThe style of food and the plating as well were nothing I had seen before or copied from any other placeAnd that it what I like the most about this placeThe unique styleThe food was good it tasted good won't say it was one of the best one but it was damn nice and I really did enjoy the food so a really good restaurant all in all
11,I come here every weekend. I love this place! Manager and staff are the best! Amazing food and the best cocktail in town. Highly recommend place for food and drinks lovers.
12,"It was dark, gloomy and dull start to the Sunday! And we needed something to pick us up for the remainder of the weekend. What better than a good hearty dinner in a cosy dinner joint! And we found just the right spot in Sutra.."
13,"I visited Sutra sometime back with my office teammates. And yes the place is totally worth the hype. The staff is well behaved and very courteous. In spite of a huge gathering the place is very well maintained. I fell in love with their outdoor terrace, but sadly it was reserved by some other group on that day.¬†Talking about the price, Sutra is moderately priced. One can easily dine with around 1200 rupees per person. The only thing that I found different here was that the Bollywood music started very late and the whole group was turned off by that ,¬† because that is something we were specifically looking for. Don't judge us for desperately wanting Bollywood music to dance on. It was...read more"
14,Very good service ..mr.satyveer singh
15,"Nice servicing from nishant ,hemant . Impressed by their behaviour Nice ambience and most imp good manager Shubhamü§üüèªüëçüèª"
16,"This is the most happning place I have been to! I cannot wait to come back again on a saturday sonic night when DJ SRB will play again. The DJ was incredible. So was the ambience. The pasta, chat pizza, virgin mojito everything was good. I hsve never enjoyed dancing to this extent."
17,"Sutra was one of the most unexpected restaurants that i have been to. I had an amazing time here. The ambience is what attracts me the most. The lavish seating, the decor, outdoor seating, grand bar and live music makes this place worth it. The dishes rage from 400-550 for veg and around 700-900 for non-veg. The presentation is amazing. We had bhatti-ka-kukkad, and it was served on a tile platter in front of us, which made my friends more excited. The pastas and the pizza were amazing. The dim lighting makes this place LIT for a dinners. All in all SUTRA you didn't let me down."
18,"So we went on a Sunday evening!!It was my wife's pre Birthday Celebration, after scrolling down lot of options ,i choosed Sutra.Epic place,good ambience and top notch hospitality ( being a Hotelier myself) ,i was satisfied with their excellent service( amid crowd rush), food quality is superb,authenticity you guys maintain.Bharat was handling our table and ensured prompt response to whatever we ordered in short while it was there, polite & smiling, its ofcourse the place that matters,food,ambience but if you have guys like Bharat its cherry on the cake( its not the brand which shines itself,its their people who make it Shine) Thank you Bharat for making our moments special & Sutra...read more"

29,Had nice winter afternoon lunch here with my friend . She has martini and I had lemonade with watermelon flavour. In food we had quesadillas and aglow Ambience was perfect
30,Visitied this place quite a few times now and have to say its one of the best places to be in Noida.
31,Recently I went to this amazing outlet in gardens galleria in Noida known as sutra gastropub. The ambience is really cool and amazing. I ordered Kolkata fish roll and paneer tikka which tasted really amazing.
32,This is an amazing place!! The ambience is beautiful and the food is the best!!Ordered new age samosa and Kolkata fish roll from here. The samosa was something new had never tried before and it was perfect!!Totally worth the cost. The ambiance is very amazing and has good vibes.Highly recommended!!!Taste-5/5Ambiance -5/5
33,Went to Sutra Gastropub with my friends after reading the reviews on ZOMATO. The ambience is amazing and good for a good get together. We ordered the mushroom risotto and the pasta. The food was pretty good and tasty. The rates are good for the quantity provided. Overall had a good experience.
34,"Their open area seating is phenomenal..Loved the ambience..The vibe here is so magical and you'll love the place for sure...Coming to food what will attract you at first place is their impressive presentation of each of the dishes they serve..Then comes the taste which again is very nice..I liked their summer corn avocado salad that has two of my favourite elements , corn and avocado...Also I liked their tandoori achari mushroom which had a perfect balance of achari flavour mixed with smoky tandoori mushrooms..The service was impressive as well.."
35,very very amazing. love the place love the food. love the ambiance..................................
36,"I am writing this review for Mr. Chandan Datta, Brand Chef. Please see the attachment wherein I have given my feedback to Sutra. Couldn't even get a feedback book and had to give feedback on a piece of paper. That too was not received by your service team and was lying on the table while we were leaving the place. Very disrespectful!! Ambience, Food and music is good but I am not sure if I will visit this place again üòí"
37,"Chef's recommended dish egg curry wasn't available, the service was too slow and especially unnecessary best table spots were marked as reserved. On discussing with manager and wasting 20 mins we got the desired table."
38,This place is like a dream pub and it has everything like dance floors and privet place as well so you can enjoy both . Went there on my date night and loved it. The ambience has something wow the food was great ‚ù§Ô∏è
39,"Very nice place for couples , where you can enjoy a evening in solace away from all the distractions and chaos"
40,The place is good. Interiors are amazing and the feel is awesome however it is atleast 1.5 times the normal cost of a good pub in Noida.If they improve their cost for two this could be THE party place in Noida.
41,"Ambience is AWESOME! Food is good. Service is disappointing. Staff gets a bit restless about taking away the dishes on Saturday nights, while you‚Äôre literally still eating. He came and grabbed my pasta bowl before he was even done asking if he could clear the table. Happened twice on the same day. Cant you see that I‚Äôm still eating? Or maybe just finish your question before grabbing the plates and let us tell you if we want the table cleared. It‚Äôs very annoying to be given such a service, esp when you‚Äôre spending a couple of thousand bucks on drinks and dinner at a good restaurant."
42,"Hi Readers,This Sutra outlet has an amazing ambience, delightful interior decor and an amazing and spacious rooftop.The staff is very professional and music is groovy.However, the liquors are a bit expensive .The food is moderately good , but it totally depends on ones taste. But if you are looking for a nice evening with good music and good rooftop , Sutra Noida is the place."
43,"The ambience, specially in the evenings, is very good. The menu is highly creative and the servers are fast and polite.However, it will make a hole in your wallet."
44,This is a third class pub which is extremely unprofessional. I would recommend nobody to go here. There are alot of better places around. 0 out of 5 rating. If you want to spoil your night do go here!
45,"We ordered a bottle , the chasers also are billed including non bottled soda and water, coke and ice . The manager refuses to remove service charges and says he will remove happy hours and remove service charges , how is that inter linked ?????Bad behaviour and bad service .Don't know how to manage clients ..Not coming here again in life"
46,"I like food,live band,and staff service is very good name is neeraj who is well active and knw how to give best service...I m very much impressed"

61,Ambience is so good just as food . Perfect for nightlife
62,I quite liked the place and the ambience. It witnesses a decent crowd and the staff is good and co-operating. One may explore it as another good option in garden galleria.
63,If you call them for table reservation they will say it‚Äôs first cum first basis. When you reach even though their are tables vacant they will still not allow you to be seated coz they have the tables reserved for a wider group. You will asked to go on the roof and then you will face the same situation. Use to like this place but not anymore. Spoiled the entire moment for us.
64,"Roses are Pink - Red and White sauce combination pasta at @sutra_noida in Gardens Galleria mall, Sector 38, Noida.Despite the heavy rush on a Saturday night the food was impressive, quality is top notch, only felt that the quantity could be better. I really liked how perfectly spiced the garlic bread was, hope they served 2 slices of it along with one serving of the pasta.Another beautiful main course from @sutra_noida Can‚Äôt start the description without mentioning the presentation of this one! The naans was cut into thick strips and hung on threads, with kebabs placed at the bottom on a bed of pickled onions along with spicy green chutney. And the kebabs were cooked to perfection...read more"

72,Very lively ambience...good music and very courteous stafff specially Bharat Singh who is very helpful indeed
73,The lady manager on 9th January night was very rude and unprofessional. She kept bothering us unnecessarily on stupid things. Things like this don't happen in other cafes. Very dissapointed. Apart from that everything was great.
74,"This place has my heart .New age samsosa is must try üòÄüòÄüòÄ .Also, thanks for the recommendation Mr. Vishwajaat."
75,Service by vishwajeet !

77,The restaurant is very well maintained. It is very spacious and not too dark as we see in most pubs. It has good variety of drinks and cocktail. The live band is amazing.
78,"Went there last night to celebrate my b'day and it was a big spoiler. Too fancy place, show off and poor quality. Food is way too expensive for the quality they deliver. Vegetable salt and pepper tasted raw, Dal makhniand garlic naan had no taste. Only rice tasted little better. Staff friendly but very limited menu and portion. No smoothies, shakes or common veg soups to offer. It's unbelievable you guys don't serve paneer tikka, every small restaurant in Noida does. Totally a bad experience and money waste. And the music was horrible and so loud. It's a place only for drinkers I think."
79,Great ambiance. Deenbandhu was a great host and help.
80,Service staff was really good specially mr. Satyaveer singh. Live music was really good.
81,Amazing service... great staff specially mr.satyveer singh

97,"well rating just on basis of customer service over the call!!! the person who picked up the phone was so arrogant and rude... as a group of 16 pax anyone would check for the deal available and would try to seek anything best can be offered. but the response from other side was so blunt crisp and loud. there is a way to say that we won't be able to handle table for more than 20 minutes. its not the first time anyone saying that to us over the phone. its was more of commanding and daunting way as if ""aana hai to aao, else jao kahin aur dekho"". on happy hours he said its till 7:30, when we said on zomato its showing till 8:00 p.m the reply was "" jab dikh raha hai to puch kyun...read more"

109,Much hyped place but It‚Äôs only good for parties and night scenes. The ambience is great with both indoors and rooftop seating. But it is extremely expensive and the food tastes bland. Must not try- Spicy Fried Chicken Ladi BAO Red sauce pasta Paulo chicken pizza

The spices were unique and the fish was very soft. Next i had was red sauce pasta. It was in a perfect italian style. Loved it.
111,I am very happy with the work of Chef Gaurav Sharma. he is such a talented young man with an amazing personality
112,"Great food, ambience and service but when it came to courteousness, you miss it strongly. After spending a quality time for more than 2 hours on the terrace, thanks to your lady bouncer for Corporate event, our night was totally ruined. I have been many times to Your Cyber hub outlet and get regular messages but my first time in Noida with friends turned out to be a complete waste despite us having a great time. Very unprofessional and disrespectful staff."
113,"The resto-bar is having wonderful ambiance. The food quality is very good except few items like chole taco. We tried their starters,chinese,north indian dishes. The portion of combos in the main course was very less. We ordered kadhai paneer combo & got just 1 roti & little rice which wasn‚Äôt even enough for 1 person & we were told by one of the restaurant‚Äôs staff that it‚Äôs good for 2 person. We expect to get more if we r paying for it.."
114,"Nice ambience.. DJ was average but pretty loud. You can dance and dance.. food presentation was good, quantity was average.. cocktails were good, though not too much variety.. service and food taste not upto the mark.. overall an average experience .."
115,"Sutra GastoPub great place with awesome ambiance. Over here you will get a luxury feel as the place interior too good to neglect.They have huge place for dinning and separate area for dance floor as its a pub.They have really many options to drink (both in mocktail and cocktails).When it comes to food, you can never go wrong with pizza, tikka, nachos, dahi kebab etc.Overall great place for parties or friday night."
116,"I went to this Sutra outlet last week with my family and we ordered one boozy pizza (don‚Äôt remember the exact menu name) . It it‚Äôs description it was nowhere mentioned that honey would be there but what we got a chilled pizza with honey at its base. We complaint about it and the manager said he can himself see the honey over the pizza and he took the pizza ( 4 full pieces as out of 6 pieces me and my sister took 2 pieces ) from our table. It was quite shocking for us that 5mins later the manager came back with the same pizza (2 pieces left) and said , Chef has tasted it and he is saying there is no honey into it.How can they serve back that chef tasted pizza back to their customers....read more"
117,"I visited sutra for the first time yesterday with me friend, and it was very well my last time also, the ambience and all is very good, it's the staff that is problematic. The service was very slow even on a weekday. At the time of billing we politely told them to remove the service charge as we were not satisfied. The staff was so rude he outrightly refused to remove it saying it is mandatory, we then called upon the floor manager. The floor manager of the place told us to 'NEVER COME BACK TO THIS PLACE AGAIN'.This was really shocking and I think this is the first time ever I've heard a staff say to its customers that dont come back to this place again"
118,"I had visited Sutra on my birthday. While making the payment of the bill, I requested the representative to get the service charged removed because the services were not worth the service charge charged. But I was forcefully made to pay the service charge even after multiple requests of getting it removed.The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 provides that restaurants billing ‚Äòservice charges‚Äô in addition to taxes is optional and the consumer has discretion to pay ‚Äòservice charge‚Äô or not. The trade practice which, for the purpose of promoting the sale, use or the supply of any goods or for the provision of any service, adopts any unfair method or deceptive practice, is to be treated...read more"

127,"I had booked a dj for my party for 2 hours which costed me 3000 rupees which was payed in advanceThe DJ just played for half an hour. When I asked for a refund/negotiation the manager Mr. Shubham told us not to 'argue' with him as we were not dancing when the dj was playing. When we told him it was none of his concern he shrewedly us that he doesn't want to talk to us anymore and that he will not negotiate even a single rupee then after almost an hour or argument he offered us complementary liquor as a negotiation without asking for age proof and insisted us to take it even when we denied and told him that we were underage, they even threatened us that they‚Äôll call cops.

128,"basically in race of doing different, these places are loosing the authentic flavours. for eg. not providing onions rings and mint sauce with chicken tikka. unnecessarily big serving dishes, which donot even fit on table. "
129,Sutra is a really good place to visit in Noida for having great food and ambiance. They have a lot of seating capacity. The ambiance was too good. And Even the food was good.Service and hospitality was good. We tried Mushroom croquettes and pizza in appetisers and Mohito and Summer cooler in mocktail. Summer cooler was not good but all other items were.So overall a good experience. A recommended one.Plus they do have live music and DJ so that‚Äôs a plus point.
130,Such a lovely place to visit your loved ones.Food was amazing also the place has such a fine interior it will automatically attract you.Service was amazing and crowd which is our second priority after food is also so goodBackground has soft music and so much positivity we could feel that day.You should definitely visit this time place once and feel the vibe of sutra 
131,"Sutra Gastropub is one of my favourite open air restaurants. The place is perfect for romantic dates. The place has lovely ambience. Whereas the food goes, the place offers endless options of dishes on their menu. The place is a multi cuisine restaurant. I liked their Jaipuri tikkis and mushroom gulwati bruschetta a lot. I tried some more dishes at this place and all tasted really well. I highly recommend this place to people looking for great tasting food in great ambience."
132,"Hand DownSutra Gastropub is one of the best restro bar located in Noida Sector 38 . Yesterday night me and my friends visited Sutra Gastropub. It is as wonderful place to hangout with friends . Ambience was fantastic and energy , crowd was top class , they have huge menu , we ordered pizza , mini dosa , starters and Drinks , All food items was hot and fresh , drinks was cold. , Pizza was overloaded with cheese and toppings , Mini dosa was best , samber was fantastic , made with right amount of spices , starters was also good , good to go along with drinks . Great ambience , staff was friendly too , server was fast and on time. Quality and quantity was top notch. I would love to visit again"
133,The whisky served did not seem to be genuine...the taste of Black Dog whisky was not that it is used to be. 
134,In all my years of gastronomic experiments I have never seen chicken kebabs served on a bed of cold marble stones accompanied by plastic green leaves!! The quality of the fish was squishy and bland with a layer of chutney on top. Disappointed! Liked the ambience and service 
135,"Poor service. Small tables and big plates which dont fit. In race of doing something different, they have actually made it bad. Unnecessarily big serving plates."
136,"They have a beautiful curated menu with all the pics depicting the presentation of their food, which is quite innovative in itself. We ordered I ordered Dahi Kung pao tofu, Kebab doughnuts, Pindi cholle tacos, Kurkure roti Eleanor pizza served with sabzi and raita aloo mother. Wonderful food."
137,"This could be your new party place in NCR.Visited it once, thought could not give feedback for single visit. Visited again and each time It was great fun.The dishes are great and with some twist and fusion.The crowd was awsome and so was the music and ambiemce.Taste - 4.5Ambience -5Service -4.5"
138,"This is now the new go-to place in Noida. A great mix of good taste and presentation. Try the dahi kebab, dosa starter and chilli chicken. Desserts are also a must have. "
139,For ambience i would give 5/5 marks but this gastropub is quiet expensive as compared to the quantity of food it provides. Some unique dishes in fancy plates can be seen here. Every dish was tasty. Dj was awesome. Rooftop area is also spacious and you can have a value time at rooftop. 3marks just because its expensive and quantity of food is very less. 5 pieces of mushroom for rs 500+ is too much.
140,The Food presentation is really out of¬† world.The food is very wholesome and mouth watering at the first sight.DJ plays some good tracks which makes you groove.ALL staff were good.Very happening place. Must visit in noida.
141,"Sutra serve unique dishes.Specially it's ambience is what you vidt this forPerfect palce to take your girl out on a date1.

Kothu lambKothu lamb is a dish cooked with chilli, ginger, tomatoIt was a very delicious dish.My experience at this place have these two dishes were very amazing.I truly loved my experience"
142,"A great night life place in Noida as far as I know. A pint of beer will cost you around 350 bucks. The vibe of this place is remarkable. Great place to party with friends and family. We ordered mango ginger chickn and mirchi prawns, very tasty and appetizing. Good serving size for everybody. Service was good.The booze rates were substantially good but it was a great experience."

144,Visited at a lunch time directly order to snake & main course but steward did not inform us that this is combo meal. I have order food which I cant use in same time. Also order extra biryani and roti. This is the way he is running resto. Very pathetic service. G M is also not replyed properly also fight for service charge. 
145,They haven't give any info for combos and no buddy gives any suggestion for food. More the 3 manager are there but need to call them no. One borther to come and ask for feedback. Stater comes after main course
146,Awesome place to hangout!! Loved the service. Ambience is good! Do try the pizza. It was Soo yummm. The paneer Tikka is also a must try! 
147,The place has an amazing ambience and the food is also good. The waiter Mani was very attentive and helpful.It is a place worth going.
148,I went there on this weekend and I had a great experience . The staff was welcoming . Food and music was amazing . And the ambiance has a great soothing vibes . 
149,"Visited this place recently for a friends birthday and blimey what a great place in all aspects. The ambience is so great and the vibes all around are too goo. The crowd that shows up here is classy and the interiors are so upscale and unique. The food they offer is so unique and presentation of food is also recommendable. We had lucknow tandoor pizza, overloaded nachos, dashi kebab doughnuts and all were great in taste and perfect explojsion in mouth. Will definitely visit again and try there other outlets as well"

152,"Really superb place. Very upscale decor and gives a feeling of luxury. The live band was so so good, don't have words to describe it.. simply awesome.. Food presentation is really out of this world, something that I have seem till now. Quality of food was too good and we were sad that our tummy were full but we wanted to eat more.Took away 1 star for service and pricing of non alcoholic drinks. I found non alcoholic drinks to be priced really high. Service was very slow and we ourselves had to find a place to sit. None of the waiters came to our help.But even after really bad Service, I'd definitely recommend this place."
153,"This newly opened cafe is surely gonna be the favourite hangout spot for many people. With a beautiful ambience and good music . A feeling of cosiness. We had mango ginger chicken, roasted chicken and mushroom dumplings. Both mango ginger chicken and roasted chicken were delicious in taste . For mains we had kadai paneer and kadai chicken with some breads . Both the dish were mouthwatering. We end our food journey with nitrogenated live destruction. Must try this . Presentation of the food is really awesome. Definitely visiting them again."
154,"I had an amazing time this past Friday at Sutra Gastropub, the crowd and music were on point. All of the staff I interacted with were very friendly and attentive, highly recommended!"
155,Apparently 'cheesecake and tacos' wasn't the answer the interviewer was looking for when he asked me what my weaknesses areüòÖü§ìThe first taco I had from @sutragp was the pindi chole tacos and now another dish added to my must have food journal......Price - 335 Rs.#tacos #mexicanfood #foodie #tacotuesday #food #foodporn #taco #instafood #mexico #delicious #mexican #foodstagram #nachos #yummy #comidamexicana #yum #foodphotography #tacosarelife #salsa #tacofusion #pindichole #pindicholetacos #lovefusionfood #sodelicious #sodelhi
156,Its an incredible spot to home base and the atmosphere is truly awesome.One of the best places to have great beverages and food.We had the White parmesan cream pasta and it was delicious. The amount could have been progressively given the costs are truly steep. With everything taken into account it is an absolute necessity visit place for its sheer magnificence and great nourishment!
157,This place has all my ‚ô•Ô∏è. It's truly a spectacle to sit here and eat in the open rooftop. The food is very wholesome and mouth watering at the first sight. It was a perfect blend of traditional and western cuisines and a true gastronomic experience. üî•üî•üî• I can vouch that this place won't disappoint you. Must try üíê.
158,"Sutra is one of the best nightclubs in NCR. Apart from its large variety of cocktails, what impressed us the most was the presentation style of the food. The food here is different from what is usually served in restaurants.The ambience is really good. We ordered chilly chicken and Isabella pizza as savoury items. Chilly chicken was good but the pizza was average. For the desert, we ordered Mille fueille crunches. It had exotic flavours but this isn‚Äôt something everyone would like.The mocktails are worth trying."
159,"I orderedKung pao tofuDahi kebab doughnutsPindi cholle tacos(not recommended)Eleanor pizzaKurkure roti served with aloo mutter sabzi and raita, not that worth itAmbiance was great"
160,"Wow is the word... Amazing place, went on Wednesday night with office colleagues... Huge space, we preferred indoor considering weather and they had Sufi night. Amazing band, I must say. Now coming to food, simply blown away with their menu and specially the way food is served. Presentation of food is mind blowing and so is the taste... Tired almost 10-11 items and none that I could say was bad. Will definitely come back again.."
161,The Dj and the ambience was great . Enjoyed a lot . One of the best places in noida to party with friends.
162,Its a great place to hangout and the ambience is really awesome.One of the best places to have good drinks and food.Inderpal is a great guy who is always present to serve good food and drinks according to your choice and never let you wait for long.
163,I went there for my husband's birthday and we enjoyed a lot. A perfect place to chill on weekends. Great vibes and awesome DJ. I loved everything except food. Food was not up to the level we ordered three dishes and liked only one. Otherwise its an awesome place. Our attendend mani was very joyful and courteous . #mustgo #lovedamibience ‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è
164,"Sutra, Noida has beautiful ambiance and very nicely done interiors. It is aesthetically pleasing and if you want the insta-worthy pics then you must give the place a try. We had the White parmesan cream pasta and it was very tasty. The quantity could have been more given the prices are pretty steep. All in all it is a must visit place for its sheer beauty and good food!"
165,"So, it was a great place overall.1- Ambience here is amazingly wonderful. The see-through ceiling really does the trick.2- Food was good too, which is surprising considering its ambience is more hyped. People really need to acknowledge the appreciation its food deserves.I'd give it 4 stars. Because the air-conditioning and music could be a l'il better."
166,"The place is very nice with good interiors. Most of the dishes were really nice except for few( chaat pizza(very bland), mushroom potato soup) . The staff was really helpful and courteous. We went there for lunch but I am sure ambience will be much better during night. Overall a nice place. And yes quantity of food served is less according to price. Full marks for the food presentation. "
167,"I had been here with friends. Recently opened in NCR I liked it. Quiet compact but totally amazing. Decent crowd and ambience. Tried Dahi k Kabab and Chicken Seekh Kabab over there, loved both cuisines. "
168,Amazing service and ambience. Loooove DJ Paurush. Keeps us rocking. And our server Mani whi makes sure no matter where we're dancing he gives us the best of service . He is so enthusiastic that it adds a charm to the evening.
169,"This was our first visit to Sutra as heard alot about it from friends and family, so thought of celebrating our first marriage anniversary there. The ambience was really good and the display of food and presentation really excites you. But I have been to many pubs and gastro bars and in comparison to others the prices are quite high and portion size is too small. Also the service is slow, even though there were only few people to dine in. We had to ask again and again for stuff and sometimes they forgot to serve the essential sides of a dish like with penne pesto they didn't provide oregano or sauce. We had to change our seats because of mosquitoes so no maintanence regarding that.We...read more"
170,"We went there on a weekday, it was crowded then as well. I‚Äôm surprised how crowded it would be on a weekend. Anyway, moving on. Food was delicious to begin with. Presentation was good too. Ambience was pretty cool. It was hot that day so didn‚Äôt go to roof top area. The only bad thing is the staff. They were unresponsive. We asked them so many times but they were busy in doing god knows what. "
171,"just nowThis is purely because of the attitude of the manager. When we asked him to remove the service charge , he told it is mandatory coz its mentioned at main entrance. You really dont want to spoil your mood arguing about these things.. but one should be atleast honest to the customers as they have not mentioned about the "" mandatory service charge"""
172,Beautiful ambiance ..... lovely place ü•∞üòçüòã‚ò∫Ô∏èüòç delicious food
173,visited this place today for lunch and it was pathetic. Ordered mini masala dosa and pizza chat. Pizaa chat was smelling bad so we told them and they offered to replace it with another dish which was also very bad and finally we decided to ask for check.. Not sure about the drinks part since we did not go for that. Also there were rats running around. They should take care of the cleanliness and food. People can't eat the ambience.
174,My first time at Sutra and I felt like being transported to some alter universe. The interiors are such a statement and every corner is beautiful.Coming to the food they have a really interesting and exhaustive menu. The good thing is that the menu has images too which makes it easier to choose. One drawback though was that there was no signs on the menu for veg/non veg which creates lot of confusion for a vegetarian like me.We ordered white parmesan Pasta. It was delicious with lots of veggies.The only negative of this place is the price point. The dishes are quite costly and the quantity is also not much.Overall a great place to hangout with your gang as there is a lot of...read more
175,I've been here four times now and can't wait to go again. It has amazing interiors and very interesting architectural elements. The desserts are their speciality for sure. There's no doubt you'll love the ambience especially if you choose to sit on the terrace. Would 100% recommend!
176,Very Rude staff 
177,"Went here when it had newly opened. Was very impressed with the interiors and the vibe the minute you enter. With amazing music and service, the menu was a complete surprise. Very exciting and exotic. And so was the taste of the food. Amazing experience. Be it their ambience or food or service. Highly recommend it. Also, do go see their rooftop. Great vibe for a nice windy evening or winter lunch!"
178,"This place had my heart from the moment I walked in. I was awestruck by their splendid ambience and soothing vibes.They have a beautiful curated menu which is quite innovative in itself with all the pics depicting the presentation of their food. Unquestionably the food here is awesome n miles ahead to others. My taste buds were thoroughly tingled by the various delicacies they have. And cherry on the cake is their Live on Table menu of various dishes and desserts.Now about our culinary experience, everything we tried here was lip smacking, enticing and beautifully presented.As it's first day of Navratri..

181,"Went to this outlet to snatch snappy beverages with companions. Atmosphere was great however entirely swarmed at ends of the week especially.¬†We requested a great deal of mocktails and beverages alongside certain sides and singed rice. Nourishment and beverages were great just as moderate.¬†Staff was amenable, music was great."
182,"Amazing place to visit. One of the best Club I went till date in my Life.. & the gesture from Amit Gautam who is in charge of Sutra Pub in Noida. He really cares alot for his guest and always ensure that everyone is enjoying theri space in the Club. The ambience, Food, Wine specially is one of the best to take up to the charge. Tremendous rooftop which will be displayed only by Worlds Best Tokas Photography. I really want each and everyone in Delhi NCR to must pay visit to SUTRA GASTRO PUB NOIDA.. "

184,"This was our first visit to Sutra. Had crossed it many times, and seen good ratings on zomato, so we chose to check it out.Ambience was very pleasant. Staff seemed courteous. Food was good.Presentation was indeed brilliant. Bartender also checked on our drinks, if they were made well. The only downside, and the one major reason which spoilt our evening, was our server- Inderpal. Bad service, horrible rather.- First off, I'm placing my order, and he just walks off mid-order - He had no recommendations, on me asking him, for the drinks or the food menu; seemed as if he's looking at it for the first time as well- Didn‚Äôt even tend to us for a good 20-30 minutes, compelling us to...read more"

Once the vibes taken care of, everything else is on auto pilot.Tried a few dishes - well presented, out of the ordinary preparation and new hits on the taste buds.Drinks - slightly overpriced, but heck, you won't be thinking twice when you're here.Overall:-Taste - 4.5/5Ambience - 5/5Service - 4.5/5Value for money - 4.5/5"
187,"This place has good rating on Zomato however my experience was not even close to the expectations per the rating. Firstly, menu design is really poor. If you are a vegetarian you really have to read 21 page menu line by line to infer whats on the list. We finally ordered 2 veg starters, both of them pathetic. Service was bad even on weekdays leave about weekends. We left in half an hour as we didnt intend to waste money and time at this place."
188,We went on weekend with friends. Drinks were really nice. And we had great time. Special thanks to staff Mr. Mani for being so helpful with the services. üòÉ

190,Its quite unfortunate to say...we went to this place with so much expectations but the staff out there was so rude and not at all attentive. Though the ambience was good ..dj was good but food was completely tasteless and less in quantity.

We were a group of three and ordered pizza, tandoori chicken‚Äôs live preparation Bhatti Kukkad, a few mocktails including sangria, Mojito and summer cooler and each one of them were too good. Later, we also ordered litti Choka, nitrogenated love destruction (live) and dahi Kebab donuts. I loved the crispiness of the kebabs and I just felt the need of a good mint chutney. The pizza was decent. The best part of the meal was Bhatti kukkad because of its aroma, it‚Äôs quantity and most importantly its taste. We totally loved it. The dessert got us excited like a kid.

199,The ambience of this place was really nice. It had a pleasant and calm vibe for a casual lunch out with friends. The pizza was good but the Jaipuri corn and dal Tikkis were super delicious and one should definitely try them out.

211,"Awesome ambience!! Dj was super good!! You simply can't stop dancing. Ordered potted puchka, boozy Bettina (pizza) and Jaipuri tikki. Potted puchka were yumm but we're too expensive for just a small portion. Boozy Bettina was super cheezily good. Jaipuri tikki totally disappointed us. We left it half eaten‚òπÔ∏è. Overall it's definitely worth a go."

The dj was placing some really cool songs and we all grooved to it. The bar was stacked up with almost everything we had to ask.Almond chicken was something that we wanted to try as we saw it for the first time and it was amazing. The way it was cooked. Loved it. Kurkure roti globe was such a beautiful dish. We couldn't stop eating. Love this place. üî•"
214,"Went this place in Noida with friends named as Sutra Gastropub. Amazing atmosphere, beautifully decorated. Unique name of restuarant so it's unique menu varieties. What all we ordered there were:-1. Roasted chicken thigh2. Sausage fried riceChicken is my all time favourite and chicken thigh was super delicious, something i tasted. Amazing spicey flavour. Fried rice was also good. Overall good quality food and deliciously made."
215,Sutra is a brand by now- my personal feeling. It has an amazing ambience and this one was no different. It looks so beautiful in the nights. The staff is very courteous. The food is mind boggling. What I tried this time was fish peera and dahi kebab donughts.Fish peera was really tasty. I loved the taste. It was cooked so well and even the presentation was beautiful.Dahi kebab donughts was in a two in one dish. Daho kebab flavour in the doughnuts. Wasn't soggy at all and tasted just fine.This place never seems to disappoint. Recommended.
216,"Went to this place with my friends. This place called Sutra Gastropub is located in Gardens Galleria is a newly opened Pub with a lovely ambiance and classic Bar. This place is a party place, so if you are searching for a party place then this for you. The cocktails and other drinks are very good. The live music is the best. "
217,"The best place in Noida for sure. Food, drinks, staff everything here is amazing.Best place to spend your weekend. "
218,Please never organise any event in future.Attended Lucky Ali event which was more crowded then Mumbai local train.Poor arrangements as well
219,"Just loved the ambience of this place!!!!Went there for a dinner and a live band was performing old Bollywood songs. The interiors were vibrant and so catchy. they have an outdoor seating area as well at the rooftop.We ordered overloaded nachos which was like regular nachos, Murgh biryani, Sicillian chicken, Laal Maas Risotto and Lucknow tandoor pizza. Among these the pizza stood out along with the biryani.For dessert we ordered a Shape of Earth (live on table) dessert.The person stood there and kept on making it with a funny story. I'd like to visit this place again and again just for their ambience.Ambience:5/5Food:4/5Service: 3.5/5"
220,"Went there for Lucky Ali concert and it was a total mess. Not sure, how some event can be so mismanaged. Forget about seating there was no space for standing properly. The food options were also limited and the food tasted bad. Won't recommend this place to anyone. "
221,Overall a good experience!!
222,"We went to this place for the first time and created very good memories here, thanks to the Jena the person who was taking care of our table he helped us out in every way. The ambiance is actually amazing, must try at least once, you will come again and again. "
223,"We went to the pub few days ago. Its was really premium restaurants with amazing interior and one of the best ambience.the music, lights everything is just feels good.we had pizza with some üç∫. First thing we noticed that Thier presentation was just beautiful. services are good. Staff was polite. pizza was really yummy my friends and me Loved it. Its a recommended place and sure will go Thier again."
224,Only and only good thing about the place is Decor that's it. For mocktails they have limited 5-6 options. Food quantity is very less and some dishes in veg are of no taste. You don't have option to choose service tax they will take 10% service tax because it's their policy. Mocktails are too costly as compared to other known chains
225,Wow this is new entry in garden galleria and ambience is just awsome. Its must visit with friends. Though its definitely too heavy on pocket with portion size really small but one time visit is must. I love sitting area near stairs. They have good DJ but would have loved if they have played more of punjabi and hindi songs. Food was fine and so were drinks. Service was good. Reducing 1 star for price and small portion size. We visited on friday and it was housefull. 
226,"We went there and really had really good time there. Place is up to the mark and had big menu we had pizza and some chicken along with beer . pizza was just so good thin crust with ultimate topping there was chicken and onion and cheese.we also had some fried chicken but that was also so good that was party so we really enjoyed the food, environment, ambience and all. It 5 star restaurant."
227,"Experience was great, we were a group of 15 people, they took good care of us. Calling them up for a reservation was a good idea. Thank You Mr. Bhuvan, you were very generous and courteous. Will definitely come back here for more."
228,"Feeling was extremely amazing. Staffs were truly helping.Great feeling and music We request few dishes, for example, chicken chilly,Veg fresh ,Fish fingers,Chicken masala Chicken and fish were delicate and superbly spiced.A must visit for every one of those gathering sweethearts out there.Service was so great and upto the imprint and an ideal eat in. Love to visit again and suggest others as well..."
229,We had gone for a weekend party with friends. It was crowded so the service was a little slow but overall the ambience and outside seating was good. We tried various drinks and food items. Most of the items tasted good. 
230,"We had dinner at their rooftop area. The ambience is great, perfect for dates and parties.We hadMexican pizza - yummyChilly paneer - must haveAglio e olio - must have."

The introduction of the nourishment is excellent. You eat from your eyes before you even taste!¬† A ton of choices for vegans, various kinds of seating accessible to suite all."
241,"This is a cafe and bar which offers cuisines such as North Indian, Continental and Chinese. Also, the prices are lighter on pockets considering it to be a massive competition to others, the place is worth every penny spent. The ambiance is lively with live music and a lovely outdoor seating arrangement. If a night-person, this is the place you are looking for. Theor staff is really courteous, Mr. Neeraj and Shubham helped us to serve at the best with a great hospitality. Really loved them as a host and server. Must try: Tandoori Chicken, murgh lahori and White Sauce Pasta. In drinks - LIIT"

The menu was picturesque with food photographs which made it even easier to order. They offer wide variety of cuisine from Indian to fusion food, Italian, asian. Their desserts are a must try.

The ambience is just amazing; the food is food too, nothing extraordinary about the food or drinks but definitely good. The staff is super friendly; i remember one of the staff offering me a complimentary cranberry vodka shot when i asked for a glass of water at the bar, saying water only after 1:00 am... haha that was so cool.

248,"Garden Galleria is our new favorite place for night out. In recent times number of famous pubs opened in this area. Sutra is one of the new addition in Noida arena. It's located as an independent pub next to Decathlon. Ambience is marvelous and expecutalor. It's very spacious. They have made arrangements for different DJs on ground and first floor. I like this idea. Sometimes we have seen only one DJ is available either on ground or first floor,which makes difficult for visitors to approach him. Food is very delicious. Price on the menu is quite reasonable. I am very impressed overall. One of the finest pub in Sector 18. Must visit for all party lovers.Food : 4/5Services :4/5Ambience...read more"

They have  an amazing ambience for both who want to sit indoors and also who have a liking for rooftop seating. One of the few places which have a great food as well as drinks menu. It is a totally instagrammable place with really cool corners to get your pics. Another great thing about them is their lip-smacking food.

252,Pleasant introduction of nourishment. Not too bad sustenance. Astounding sustenance and incredible atmosphere! We Order Bhatti ka chicken and Isabella pizza.The chicken was incredibly delicate and very much cooked. The pizza base was delicate and the fixings were excessively great. It's great spot with an astounding administrations and their introductions of nourishment is magnificent and the absolute best part was their condition sustenance was exceptionally delightful and all around served.
253,"Went there for a get together party, good place but lack of management, we were total 10, but the was unable to provide a table, they asked us to search for the table, after 40 mins of reaching there, we got the table which was for only 5 people, that was depressing.If someone is paying bill amount of 10K then in return he can expect some hospitality, atleast provide a proper table with chairs for all members.Food was fine, music was good & loud. Ambience was good.#SutraGastropub #GardensGalleris #Sector38 #Noida #DelhiNCR #Zomato #YummyDiaries #Fooodist #KeepEating"
254,I had seen this place from outside and was already impressed by its look. Red brick walls with plethora of greenery can never go wrong! The interiors were breathtaking. The area with the glass ceiling was spectacular. It had different ambience in every corner of the restaurant. We started with Mini Masala Dosa and Dehydrated Tomato Onion Kulcha. Mini dosas were surprisingly so good. It shattered all expectations and delivered a succulent dish which I ended up craving for more. Kulchas did their own magic. They were filled with crunchy fillings which tasted amazing. The spread complimented it beautifully. Next was something that i was looking forward to from the beginning : Live at...read more

259,Sutra has been one of the most buzzing property in the Cyberhub from the time it opened a few years back there and still is one of those party places which is always looked forward to. The brand upped its game by opening a humungous property in Noida with a breathtaking ambience and a very interesting food menu to look forward to. We were very intrigued by these both and thought of checking this place out on a Sunday.
260,A spontaneous decision to satisfy our hunger pangs in Sutra turned out to be amazing. Highly courteous staff esp Neeraj and Balwinder.. The chef was quite polite in understanding the little imperfections in Caesar salad and gave us another dish on the house.. Loved their Lavander fizz and Noodles.. My dearest hubby despite being full could not resist the temptation to finish the bowl of noodles. Do try their chholey taco as well... As for the ambience it is one of the best esp the look of openness and greenery even in the centre inside of the restaurant. 
261,I visited this place on sunday there was live music going on and it was pretty good. We ordered this bhatti ka murgh and it was really delicious as it had fried and different sauces with it like salsa blueberry flavoured sauce and was served along with the lacha pranthas. Overall a nice experience.. will visit again. 
262,"Such a spacious and lavish pub , Dance floor superb, i have been here multiple times!! Gentle staff and cool environment, it‚Äôs become one of my favourite spot now .. Cheers ü•Ç "
263,"Amazing place, Lovely vibes, Being from Dubai I have been of best places around the world but this place again won my heart when it comes to NCR - Kudos to the staff for lovely customer service, Ambience is all about the love and Eve u want to spend with somebody special, the only 1 drawback - Guys keep your tables cleaned from permanent spots - it gives a bad impression about the identity of this place. Overall an amazing place to spend an eve. "
264,Awesome place.. best DJ.. exquisite decor.. and on top of everything.. the warm and sweet people there as the crew.. thanks Bhuvan and Shubham for all the help that you extended !! Will be back for more.. for sure.. loved the experience.. !!!
265,I wish i could rate more than 5 for this place! Food and ambience are outstanding! Ambience of various types was available based on your choice. Live music performances with great decor and ambience. Food was in good quantities with such unique taste! Cocktails could be much improved. I would look forward to going here again!Women's toilet has pictures of cute men and men's toilet has pictures of pretty women! But the most amazing thing that caught my attention is that none of those pictures shows the body of these people! Just their smiling faces staring back at you!! üòãüòã
266,"Such a lavish place in Noida SEC 34. Been there last weekend to celebrate my special evening with my fiancee. Loved the ambience... crowd and vibes of the place. It looks amazing in night time.Food was great... quantity was goodWe ordered mushrooms bruschetta , litti choka and Italian pizza. For drinks we have signature cocktails.Rooftop area was nice and quiet for nice dinner date.Although it was expensive than expected... 6k for 2.Lastly we had mawa cheesecake which was cherry on cake . Great experience üëçWould love to visit again soon."
267,"Delicious food, good service, and live music are the main quotient of Sutra GastropubThis place offers an open-air sitting as well. They have some good drinks on the menu along with sumptuous food options.‚ñ∂I had these cheesy nachos, and they were really worth the price. "
268,"Definitely among the most beautiful pubs I have ever been to. The Live Rock band uplifted the visit even more. Ordered Pasta, Jaipuri Bites, Pizza. Food was delicious! Especially the Pasta, had to order it again.My top pic for getaways in Noida!"

Yes it's costly than expected (6k for 2 person).Would love to visit again soon.Thanks team üëç"
270,The service was so bad that I got a bp inspite of asking for a black label large. I mean wtf. The worst part they did it twice. Not sure if it was royal stag but surely not black label. 
271,Amazing place...Awesome food...Lovely ambience and music too...We 3 BFFs had an wonderful pre friendship day celebrationüíïü•∞üíãLoved to go again and definately must go place once
272,"Highly unprofessional people.. Food was average but the worst part was the hospitality of the staff. Moreover when the whole country has moved from service charge issue they still have a service charge mandatory policy and they have all the time in the world to argue with an explanation that it is our rule, you have to follow. Overall unpleasant experience."
273,"The Aura of this place is nice. Food was amazing. We been there on Saturday night with friends. Although the place was packed we get honoured to get in. The staff is cuertios, polite and friendly. Had a good time. Special thanks to Baljeet and Rajesh to find us a table and entertain us. Will suggest the place to go out with friends ."
274,Service  was great with wow food with best service given from service boy jaiveer  5 star for him and table very well handled by manager Baljeet Would suggest people to try it with best view great music and Ambience.
275,Bad service. Really loud music without any air coolers in the open roof area. The servers were only serving on one of the floors and they had three total number of floors. The outlet manager was obnoxious. His excuse was that weekends are really busy so some times these things happen. Food portions were really low. That is why the zomato rating is dropping like clothes in a Sunny Leone movie. I am never going back there again for sure. 
276,Superb food quality... amazing taste... all at a wonderful cost. I recommend everyone should try at least once... Thankyou Sutra for giving us such an amazing place. Thumbs up.
277,"Wooowwww... Quite relaxing.. amazing staff, I would like to thank Satish, Shubham, Gaurav for attending us in such a nice way. They have places for different requirements and that's the best part.Food taste is amazing."
278,Amazing food and great ambience. I liked the staff service.Terrace view is awesome . Liked the live music.delicious food and nice theme.Enjoyed
279,"Excellent ambience, amazing experience at this place, tried tandoori achari mushroom, pasta and dahi kebab everything was amazing. üíØServed by - Jaiveer"
280,"Finally find a place in noida yo hangout in noida,Great place, great staff, special thanks to inderpal for his service. satish is a great host.i will be coming back soon with my friends."
281,Amazing place to visit with your friends. The hospitality and ambience is commendable. Appreciable services of whole team of Sutra especially restaurant Manager Jay Kumar Chaoubey. Keep it Up and always shine like this.
282,"Great ambience, lovely food. Staff is so helpful and caretaking specially Jaiveer, great server and so easy to talk to. It is definitely a must visit. "
283,Ambiance 5Food 4Service 5Music 5Over all nice experience. It was just a random visit but didn't expected this kind of place. Indoor and terrace both are nice. 
284,highly appriciable place in noida . visited several times coz of its effective rates and lively ambience.i loved this place for parties
285,"Yes as per assumption good food, nice service, great ambiance. Really a amazing place to visit. I been to other outlets as well but this new venture of sutra is best amongs them. Me and my friends was waiting for a good one in noida and got. Thanks to sutra team üë´üë´üë´. "
286,"Have visited this place, had a good time. The environment is really good, the music is nice though need song improvising and some themes. I really liked the food and drinks. My only advice is to curtail the price of food and drink as the served portion was way very less and not proportioned to the price they charge. Overall had a lovely time. The attendee Anoop who was assigned to our table during my last visit is very professional and good."
287,Just being as polite as i can be. This is what you get for serving non veg food to vegetarian customers and then acting like goons threatening them instead of apologizing. I wish zomato had zero stars coz 1 star is more than what you guys deserve.
288,My friend visited this place last night. She has ordered vegetarian dish but they have served non veg dish and after asking for apology they were threatened by the bouncers ü§¨ What kind of a place is this where they don‚Äôt have any ethics. What‚Äôs the point of running such hospitality where you don‚Äôt know how to serve your customers. This is disgusting. Today on asking for veg dish you people are feeding non veg tomorrow you can feed anything you want . 
289,"My friend was here last night with her family and friends, all of whom are vegetarians, and they were served with non vegetarian dishes. On asking for apology they were threathened by the bouncers. Its unacceptable when pub owners don't admit their mistakes and refuse to offer a simple apology.While Zomato is in the recent news with a positive message, it is hoped some action can be taken against such arrogant and harrasing pubs to maintain the highest standards. "
290,Rude behaviour of management. Worst place to spend your time and hard earned money. Please drop the idea of going there if you are planning to go.
291,"If you have vegetarian friends or relatives please do not go. Read my experience here.We, a group of friends went there and ordered vegetarian dishes. The staff served us with non veg. Some of us who have religious ideology even ate those by mistake. On confronting the manager we were threatened by bouncers and they didn't even gave us the bill. All we asked them for was an apology.Highly unprofessional staff. The quantity of food items was very less and taste was just fine.Please do not go there if you are a vegetarian they mix these things up all the time as said by the manager himself."
292,"Went here on a Friday for a team party. This place is only good superficially. Good looking place, good looking food. Thats it.Food is just basic with only a good garnish. Will never visit here again. Quantity is also meagre. You'd have to order a lot of the same dishes. Would rather visit it's better counterparts inside gardens galleria. Much much better food.Drinks too only look good. All cocktails are watered down. And the staff doesn't even rectify the matter when informed about the situation. Really bad experience.Place very clearly can't handle large groups. They also missed 2-3 dishes, out of which 2 didn't arrive atall and one arrived after an hour of ordering, cold, despite...read more"
293,Finally one nice place in Noida for pubbing Excellent food and drink menu. Sad they don‚Äôt serve Old Monk ( not sure why)Music was good and it is pulling right set of crowd. Double thumbs up
294,Pathetic service and the staff is patheticWorst experience everHad visited for the team party and they responded unwell and unethicalDon‚Äôt try it 
295,"Had been to this place a couple of weeks back. It was a Thursday eve and We went for a corporate party. So we had pre-decided typical menu.Initially we had trouble as they were not able manage well. But later it was fine.Chicken and fish, both starters were good. Honey chilly potato is definitely a NO GO. Good cocktails.Didn‚Äôt find the service good enough for a big group.Would like to visit again with a smaller group, I am hoping it to be a better experience."
296,Amazing food and great ambience! Though a little high priced but the food really tasted fantastic! The complementary mango tarts they offered tasted a little bad. Noodles were exactly how I would have expected them to be. Red sauce pasta was heavenly. And tandoori achaari mushrooms were out of the world!
297,"It is located between garden galleria and wowAmbience:5/5 ( Beautiful decor, nice set up and amazing roofop)Staff: 4/5Food:4.5/5 (pizza - must try)Mocktails: 3.5/5 (over priced)"
298,"Standing out amongst a whole bunch of outlets at a single place, this Gastropub does it well.I was there with couple of my friends that too during daytime on weekday.I was very attracted to their menu items, they were what other pubs were offering but with no tongue twisters :pItems served were delicious and upto mark, almost 8-10 different items from all possible categoriesBest part was their presentation and service guy was also very polite.You guys deserve 5*.The tarts were complementary "
299,Sutra Gatsropub is a famous place in Gurgaon and have visited that place quite a few times so I wanted to try this place in Noida. The ambience was lit and attractive. I tried their mini masala dosa which was really tasty. The sambar also had a delicious flavour. Also their kung pao tofu and broccoli is a must try. It's healthy and delighful. For desserts I tried mousse and sinful which was lovely.
300,wow... the great place to spend some times with family and friends. Very cool and clean place to have special dishes. Staff behaviour is gud.
301,Brilliant ambience. Excellent main course. Ordering starters and desserts was a mistake. The quantity of starters and desserts is seriously a joke. But it is worth going for the main course and the ambience along with the live band on Sunday
302,They have the most interesting menu with very wide range of dishes. We had Bhatti ka chicken and Isabella pizza. The chicken was amazingly soft and very well cooked. The pizza base was soft and the toppings were too good. I love to visit here for weekend parties. The open terrace space is spectacular.
303,"The place was absolutely buzzing. Starting from the wallet to the food service they were courteous. Ambience is great. I tried Dahi ke shollay, Mini dosa, Mango ginger chicken. And everything was ammaaazziing."
304,"Visited here several times,it's one of my favourite place in delhi ncr. It's a very happening place with the millenials. Ambience is really nice. Amazing food and the main thing is their presentation. They have a very unique way of serving food. Thanks shubham khanna for your service. You really made my day. "
305,"They should advertise in bold ""children not allowed"". They can't expect families to return from the door just because they have kids with them. How can they open a restaurant, which does not allow children, in a place which is full of families with children."
306,"Food Just OK. Service Pathetic. Nunber of service staff is lot more than the nunber of tables, still they are not able to manage orders. Orders are not taken properly & delegated further which are not folowed. You order for 4 items & expect 2-3 to reach you eventually. The manager comes once on each table, takes feedback & after assuring better service, he is no where to be seen alongwith his waiters. If going to this place, its advisable to carry alongwith your food & drinks ü§°. Music wise this place will take minimum 10-15 years to reach where the world is today.  Nothing more to say üôè"
307,"Very unprofessional of Mr. Deb/ Dev to have rudely asked us to leave just because we had kids with us. We had come a long way as it was not mentioned anywhere that the kids are not allowed on 2 days, which was nowhere mentioned online or on Zomato. Further, they could not have been more rude in stopping a customer. They should have politely told us.I would boycott this place forever and never want to visit a place whose staff are in their own air and ego. It shows the culture of the place."
308,"Been there last Friday,after long time...still the same vibe....jam-packed no place even to stand...rain was the cherry on the top..I saw people enjoying rain dance.took 15 minutes to get me one beer, remind me of old days of sutraGood thing is that staff remembers me even I went there almost after gap of two years.They have changed there entire menu which has good options for nen veg lovers. DJ was different than regular. God bless you guys, keep it up "
309,I would not recommend this place for the food lovers especially vegetariansAmbience: GoodFood (Veg): Below average. Presentation is good but taste is missing.
310,"We went with our friends on a Friday night and we had great time here.everything was perfect there. Loved the food, music,ambience. Will surely go there again "
311,Outstanding place to chill out !! Fan to visit !!! I really enjoyed so much because atmosphere is too good !! Sitting area is also good!! Highly recommended
312,Such an astounding spot with nourishment that looks pretty and tastes amazing.Absolutely the best spot I have had in the Noida. Their administration is extraordinary and they nearly make you feel comfortable. They have an assortment to looked over the menu and have astonishing north indian. They have platters which are presented with bit of roti and dal makhani with the decision of your curry.
313,Bad experience as staff is rude and are cheatersSad state of being polite by staff .Packed food goes missing from the packets .....Absolutely not recommended 
314,It's superb place with an amazing services and their presentations of food is awesome and the very best part was their circumstance food was very delicious and very well served recommend to all of my friends to be there at once surely you will love this place
315,The staff was amazingThe ambience was goodThe place is near to the metro stationThe one who loves good quality of food should visit it‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è

322,"The place was super amazing....The food , ambience , staff everything was perfect... Highly recommended...Do try food was different, n superb taste...The Assistant Restaurant Manger Shubham khanna was really good n his management was amazing "

324,"Ever visited sutra gastropub in noida?If not,then must try their food atleast once.Visited this place with my friends and we had mini masala dosa,overloaded nachos,chaat pizza,white cream pasta thandai panna cotta.Food tasted very good and we loved it.All items were flavourfull.Ambience was just amazing.Staff was nice.Enjoyed ur day to the fullest."
325,Well a very impolite staff at the entry not allowing couple with kid although it's not published any where. Went on a Sunday evening before 8 when there's no rush and they kept on giving all sorts of excuses. I have read other similar reviews hence people don't waste your time there are better pubs which are kids friendly. 
326,"We had chicken biryani, fish Tikka and peshawari mutton. The flavors were so on point and the food was very flavourful. I like things on a spicy side so I loved the peshawari mutton. Overall a great place."
327,Awesome place good for family in the evening and for couples at night.the service staff is very friendly and there also lot of greenery all over the place.
328,Loved the place must be visited once . Awesome place and the ambience is mind blowing . Sweets and the starters are very good . Main course much better 
329,Not sure how they are charging GST over liquor? As GST is not applicable at all. And I surprise how man customer they have cheated as only few of us know this fact even I checked this bill in morning only.
330,The food and ambience is really nice. We enjoyed alot. The music was really nice. Mr. Jaiveer served us really well. Would surely visit this place next time.
331,"@jivar awesome place , healthy environment , best place to hangout , the  food was very nice ,live music , must try grilled fish and Thai chicken üòçüß°"
332,"We had been to this place for a team party with team of around 50 people, There service was so poor that few of team members had to leave without having dinner and also the staff who was attending us along with manager was very rude and arrogant , I would never recommend this place for large gatherings "
333,"It is the worst place and staff is seriously none other than gundaas. We were sitting and having lunch today and on another table guests oredered some food and then upon their some argument, their waiter started fighting and he literally broke the tray on the table by showing towards guest. It's literally surprising and then also their management didn't take any action. Beware of going in Sutra with family. If in drinks something wrong happened god can only save you in that place. "
334,"Sutra is definitely my go to place now!!Beautiful ambience,great food and such positive vide. The way they treat their customers is great and special thankyou to Mr. Jaiver for being nice and humble!!"
335,Who TF has a couples entry only on a Friday afternoon. Was very disappointed to know that when we reached the place. They should advertise it if they have such arbitrary rules in place discriminating single people and others üòï
336,"The term Gastropub is a little too commonly used these days, Sutra gastropub however holds true to the name. This place is located atop the hip and bustling Cyber Hub, spreads across approximately 5000 Sq. feet and can seat about 170 people at a time. The menu is equally vast and offers a variety of sumptuous pub grub. The burgers here are definitely worth a try, especially the ‚ÄòLegendary Chicken Burger‚Äô which comes loaded with crispy bacon and caramelised onions. The wafer thin pizzas are also not to be missed, pepperoni and chicken shawarma being the fastest moving out of the lot. When it comes to their cocktails they aren‚Äôt afraid to put lots of alcohol in them even during happy...read more"
337,Good for evening parties.Nice ambience.They have three floors..but only groud floor available in afternoon. Nice presentation of food. Decent food. Extremely less variety of vegetarian food.
338,"Very classy decor and ambience is lit. Quantity and quality of the food is too good. Staff was courteous ,professional and I am looking forward to visit again. Dance floor is a bit small in size but apart from that everything is bang on target. Food is mouthwatering and drinks are at reasonable rates.Must visit place"
339,Amazing ambience #awesome food...great staff..good service...sushi is must try...isabella pizza was really good...and with all this when you have great music the place becomes more enjoyable. Thank you so much for such a great experience.

344,"Loved this place! We were the only customers and I have no idea why because the food was delicious and the prices friendly! I had the Fish Tikkas, Peshawari Mutton, Garlic Naan and some dessert and they were all great! Will definitely come back again!"
345,"I've been eating at this place for about 1 month now, almost every week! Coming from the Greater Noida its hard to find great Indian food like we have back home (anyone from the Noida will tell you this). There is a long history of Indian restaurants in the Noida going back to the last couple of years and earlier. So it was great to find this place. Fantastic Dishes, (not just Modern Indian Fusion like some places) great price and great service. Excellent Decor/ Food/ Drinks/ Services....What more do you want!"
346,Outstandingly awesome ambience...yummilicious food with superb presentation üëåüëå Fast service provided by Neeraj üëçüëçwill recommend this place to all my friends ....would visit again soon!!

Would like to thank Mr Jaivir restaurant manager who takes well care of every one. Good food good music nice DJSpecial thank to Mr Jaivir and Mr Baljeet.Will hit the place again soon. Thanks "
349,"Pathetic and worst experience ever. NEVER GO TO SUTRA ( NOIDA)Yesterday I went to this stupid lounge ( SUTRA) with my husband.I took 3 vouchers from nearbuy which had only drinks deal.Food was supposed to be ordered from al-carte. As and when i entered the restaurant and showed him the nearbuy voucher, firstly he denied for the services saying that this deal is not valid at Noida.. You can go to Gurgaon to avail the deal but somehow we managed to convince him for the same. Manager at the restaurant redeemed our voucher and without asking us about our preferences for the drinks, he brought any brand himself in a flask which was not in right quantity too.( though there were 4 choices of...read more"
350,"Yesterday i went there with friends, the place is good but the food quality & quantity was so bad. Specially quantity was very less. We have ordered 2 chilly paneer 2 mushroom and few more. Only 4 paneer peices was there in per plate and also in other item as well.Overall it was very bad experience we had which was not expected.I will never recommend someone to go there in future."
351,"Sutra is a beautiful restaurant with a very modern and simplistic layout. It is a new take on Indian Casual dining. We started off with some delicious Cauli Chili Fry and some cocktails that were refreshing and presented nicely. We ordered Mini Masala Dosa, chef special Mirchi Prawn, garlic and s and Almond Chicken. All of the foods were flavorful and tasted different than your usual Modern Indian cuisine. The flavors were elevated and present with smoky and rich tastes. We were given some desserts to try which included a rich and creamy Masala Thandai Panna cotta dish. Definitely would go back!"
352,Very expensive place according to Noida. Staff is not clear about the rates. I ordered Pindi Channa Taco and they presented me with channa poori. There is no taste in the food. The things they gave complimentary were also charged in the bill. 
353,Place is quite good and beautifully decorated Environment is very nice and shubham and pramod did their job very well and the food was also tasty. 
354,5 parameter review!1. Ambience - 5 stars2. Food taste and portion size - 3 stars3. Drinks taste and quantity - 3 stars4. Washroom hygiene - 5 stars5. Staff courtesy - 1 starOverall - 3/4 stars
355,"Yuumm! I'm sooo happy there's some new restaurants in the Noida-38.¬† Gastropub didn't disappoint. ¬†The food is absolutely fantastic.¬† Amazing flavors.¬† Mango chicken, you name it...we didn't have a bad dish.We went when they have amazing range of drinks and recently went and sat at the bar...they have some FANTASTIC bartenders and cocktails.¬† Guy is like a king mixologist.¬† It's almost hypnotic to watch him mix up the drinks.Service was great both times."
356,"Maybe it was my first time and this is a new place, but the first thing I would like to praise is their staff! Extremely jolly, helpful and considerate. They actually make you feel like you‚Äôre important! They‚Äôre well versed with the menu, the ingredients and will make special arrangements for you if you‚Äôre allergic to a particular ingredient. Great ambience! Good music and overall a really good time! Thank you Sutra for a lovely Sunday evening! I ordered the naan sausage rolls and mango garlic chicken, both served and prepared differently but extremely good! I loved the extra touch they give to their plating!"
357,Worst experience I ever had... There was no one to attend us. And the food was over priced also taste was worst. I will never come to this place again... Totally overcrowded.
358,"Great place in Noida, what made it even more beautiful was there is a guy named Anup, ask him anything, and he will try to suggest the best options in foods and drinks. Great place again"
359,Very very very very pathetic n unpolite stafff i really liked the ambience of this newly opened place i booked a table in advance to have a nice time... After reaching the Place we were offered sears beside the washroom... N they argued a lot...Service is pathetic...Food was fineQuantity nt worthOnly good for ambience

Service was so fast by sontty.. I would like to say many thnks to managment ... Manager is also so smart mr. Bhuwan ji ... Mr.bartender is so great person ... Overall was osm ...
361,"New Place Alert!I recently visited the Sutra Gastropub when I was looking for a new place to take my cousins to, who came from abroad. The moment I saw the pictures of this place, I was spellbound and knew this has to be it!The place in real is as gorgeous as the pics I saw online. It is a huge and open space with beautiful lightings. The menu is also very expansive. I ordered a bunch of stuff for all of us, but I remember a few dishes especially.The almond chicken, the seekh kabab and the masala thandai pannacotta are some of the knockout dishes that I had there. I suggest that you try them too. I would love to come back to this place! "
362,After missing the launch event was looking forward to visit Sutra Noida and finally made it ! üòÑHuge place with almost 3 levels and amazing ambience! The food was pretty good with one of the best plating in the vicinity! Loved the Dahi Kebab Donuts which had a crispier crust (nri medu vada aka donut styleüòÑ) and savoury accent than the regular sweetness that we often find in dahi kebabs!Relished the Cilantro fish tikka with its green crust that gave it an amazing freshness without an overdose of the cilantro flavorMalai mawa and Gulkand cheesecake proved to be the best part of today‚Äôs treat with an amazing amalgamation of gulkand and cheese flavors ! Never thought these 2...read more
363,Such an amazing place with food that looks pretty and tastes amazing. Loved the litthi chokaaaa and the spinach chaaat. A must visit place in noida for ambience and pretty food and a good time.
364,"Absolutely the best place I have had in the Noida. Their service is phenomenal and they almost make you feel at home. This is a frequent dinner place for us. The only problem is the massive crowd of people waiting to get in. Despite this, the food is totally worth it. Indian Modern fusion dishes are highly recommended."
365,"New Establishment in the Noida in the Garden Galleria Mall. Really good food, nice environment. Service was very attentive. I had the Prawn, it was great, and really decent naan. If your in the mood for Indian, great place. And, they are open late till 1 am. Totally outstanding place for date."
366,"This is the best Indian food I have ever had, and the other three people I ate with agreed. I found this place on app, which also gave raving reviews. It is massive place, stunning decor and ambience. We sat down, and it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to come over. Not a good start.But the food came, and completely blew us away. The four of us shared Mini Masala Dosa, which was maybe the best dish, Dahi Kebabs, also amazing, chicken tikka, which was a little dry but very flavorful, and the Mango Ginger Chicken, a fish Peera that was equally incredible. Even the rice was great. Dont judge a book by its cover. This is the best Indian restaurant in Noida."
367,Think of a night party think Sutra Noida...this place has set high bars for partying in Noida and their interior is pretty amazing...sets the mood right...i had lovely evening my friends and out of the box food and drinks menu is to die for....
368,"We were headed to another restaurant when we saw this place. It was newly established Restaurant in the Noida. It was truly an amazing experience. From the Music, to the impeccable and overly attentive service, to the amazing flavors. I will definitely be returning. I always appreciate people who work hard and take pride in being good at what they do!!! It has stunning decor and food is equally good."
369,The new party place in town! This place has a lit ambiance & finger licking food. They have a variety to chose from the menu & have amazing north indian. They have platters which are served with portion of roti & dal makhani with the choice of your curry.
370,"Great Ambience but extremely pathetic service, the waiters are busy watching world cup matches and forget to bring half of the order. They should get a leave on the day of cricket matches, so that they can sit home and enjoy the match. I had really high expectations but wont be visiting this place again"
371,"A perfect disco, where you can party as much as you can dance your heart outFood and drinks not so goodWe ordered:Chat pizza which was pathetic the worst thing wastage of moneyOverloaded nachos were goodSalt and pepper vegetables were also goodMurg bharwaan Lahori was goodPasta was okayishDal makhani was very goodPaneer was also goodDrinks were not good and shots were somewhat dilutedOnly reason for 3 points is best ambience, food and service."
372,"Been there with my best friend and enjoyed a lot. Loved the ambience. Ordered Salt and Pepper vegetable, Overloaded Nachos and Bombay Sapphire with Tonic water. It‚Äôs mind blowing. Veg Sushi was a little disappointment but overall it‚Äôs awesome. Highly recommended."
373,"First visit was okaish but there is no system for reservation and there are many other better options in gardens galleria. Cocktails are not worth, quantity is very less. Deals are good, manager is very rude and it matters when you are thr to spend some quality time with friends and family. Go for other options"
374,"Is there any membership worth 1 lakh rupees? I was with my friend at around 8 pm. I asked them for an entry. They rejected me. Asked me to get the membership worth 1 lakh. I contacted main ofc, they told there is no such membership. It would start from next month. Still the managers are looting the people.This kind of pub should be shut down at garden's galeria. The manager also misbehaved with me. "
375,"I loved the ambience, service is really good and the manager Shubham was really polite and helped us in deciding the menu. Must visit this place. Food is really awesome."
376,"The ambience is soo soo good! If you go at night, you will love it! The dj is super good, i went on a saturday night, and loved it so much! Its going to be my go to place from now on :D"
377,"Went for lunch.Menu is colourful I must say takes time to understand the fancy names and dishes but doesn't disappoint.Maybe ditch the welcome snack (mango lassi tart).Love the use of indoor plants all over the place.Lot of options for seating indoor, outdoor, terrace and open.Staff is polite and courteous.Ambience 10/10Food 8/10Food styling 10/10Music 8/10 Generally EnglishPocket friendly 7/10Smoking areaBarMatch ScreeningsDJWaiting to see the nightlife.Definitely recommend.

378,"Ambience- 4/5Service- 5/5Food- 4/5The location of this place is bit out of the main mall area and because of that I couldn't visit this in the scorching summers. But with the first rain of the monsoon, finally I visited this.This place is lit! It has amazing ambience, nice music and perfect to sit and spend some nice time!I really liked the smiling, courteous staff. They were really attentive, despite a good crowd on a Friday afternoon.

379,"I went to Sutra Noida almost 3-4 weeks back. The place is new, its ambience is really nice. I believe it got two floors and ample amount of space for a group of friends to chill there.The rating that I've given is only for the Ambience.Because the food was really bad.We had mix sauce pasta, margherita pizza and for drinks: One Mojito and Non-alcoholic Sangria.Mix Sauce Pasta was very salty which reduced its original taste.Margherita Pizza, Crust was not crunchy being a thin-crust pizza.

380,Went with office colleagues and overall experience was good. They had live music on Thursday. Service was good. Probably one of the best pubs in Noida so far. I need to visit again to experience it little better.¬†Our server Inder was awesome.
381,"Noida finally gets a superb superb place to party!!! Beautiful set up! Good food! A request, if you can get Dastak Band performing @ your place! It‚Äôs an amazing band... I heard them in Sutra, Gurgaon. "
382,Till now the best bar and Restaurant i have tasted any where. Their Pasta are equally tasty. No doubt this place is always busy but still manages to provide good service. Only issue is the chicken dish. ..tends to go dry if u dun eat immigration but again it is deep fried with batter so good only when eaten immediately. Otherwise every single dish is worth the money.¬† Not much into vegetarian food (on Tuesday) so have tried only few dishes but appetizers are very tasty an unique. Decor and ambience is perfect to explore..
383,"The place has 2 floors full of people. Both floors play different songs n ambience. Ground floor has a better dancing floor tho. The main purpose was drinking and dancing which was fulfilled by sutra. The crowd was awesome and many small parties were going on there. The place is costly tho.Food is okayish, ordered many things many were unsatisfactory thoDO NOT order chat pizza - 1/5 500 RS wasted!Pasta was good( red)Chicken stuffed bad - 1/5Nachos loaded -4/5Liit and drinks were okayish -3/5Dal makhani was good -5/5 platter was good.Ambience -6/5Service -2/5 they missed many things ordered and had to be reminded"
384,"Amazing Place. Went in for a team party. Great ambience, music and crowd. I generally don't see so many bouncers, which was a good thing here. I didn't like the food part much, maybe because we had a package deal they didn't gave quality items. I believe their ala-carte menu would be better. Taking off 1 star for food."
385,"One of the best places in Noida to catch up with your friends over amazing drinks,cocktails, and food! Trust me the food is damn delicious no matter whatever you try from the extravagant menu. Not just the food is beautifully presented it tastes impeccable. A must go whenever you are in Noida. Also, the staff is very prompt and very polite. "
386,One of the most rocking places in NOIDA . An absolute delight and the staff is extremely helpful and friendly especially Shubham and Deb . Nice ambiance.awesome music
387,"Delightful and peaceful atmosphere, delicious food, great service. You can't go wrong with anything here!!! Love the Modern Indian Cuisine with Fusion. The Mango Chicken is a must!!! Great beverage list and lots of space and perfect ambiance. The flavors are excellent!"
388,"Liked the taste of food, its very well made and consistent with the use of spices. The bar is however disappointing. They served us LIIT with mint leaves in it - I am not sure why does the bartender wants to garnish and take away the basic taste of the drink.Otherwise - food is amazing."
389,It‚Äôs a beautifully decorated places which has great spots for some amazing Insta-worthy photographs. The whole place has an ambience that calls out for party and fun. The food is just amazing. Bhatti da Kukkad is an extraordinary dish that looks so pretty when it‚Äôs made live that you dnt feel like eating it. Another delicious and mouth-watering delicacy was their butterfly prawns which were crispy and tender exactly as they should be. It‚Äôs indeed a lovely to go and hangout with family or friends.
390,"New place in Noida visited by us last weekend. Very happening, live music, tasty food, but costly drinks but the inside look of this whole themed place makes your mood refreshed. A little on upper budget side when it comes to drinks like a pint for 495, fixed 10% service charge apart from GST you have to pay."
391,Horibale service on a Tuesday also...and they dont remove the service charge even by asking them.He said it is mentioned on the menu in a rude manner..
392,"It is new in Noida , I went out with my friends to chill out and it was damn amazing. Food was very tasty and music was good!!! Will definitely plan out again!!!"
393,"Music and ambiance are all great here! Loved it! Their preparation and presentation is also nice.First of all, I want on Sunday night and the live performances was amazing. But if you don't want to hear loud music while having your food then their rooftop is a good option.Food is good, not bad, not great, just good, it's wasn't the best I have had but it is good enough to say that it is definately not bad. (Two beer down it won't even matter though)Price wise, as it is a gastropub therefore it's definitely pricey than any ordinary bar, but for it's ambiance and environment it's worth it.If you want to party and dance then this place is a must go to."
394,Guys while you have amazing music but the food quality is below average and exceptionally slow services. We ordered mostly vegetarian dishes including north india main course. All of them were below average. 
395,Amazing place. We went on sunday night and I am in love with this place. The decor is beautiful and the food is amazing. I also loved the live music. The staff is humble and service is also quick. Gaurav referred us there who is also a sweet manager. Highly recommended place. 
396,The dj here is ridiculously good. His beats and changing of tracks were great. We literally danced our way out of the place. The ambience of it is amazing and the staff is great. They provide free shots to girls too (not sure if every Sunday thing) but the vibe is awesome and kudos on the interior work. I am definitely coming here for a parties again!
397,"Amazing place. Spacious, great food and super amazing dj. The staff is also very nice. Great crowd. Super millennial interiors. Just need to put more lights. "
398,"Best experience everrrrr!!!Totally in love with the ambience of this place, really impressive.Work on menu is done very beautifully and in a very organized way.Quality of the food and taste of the food was excellent.Would love to visit this place again n to try for more food."
399,"This newly opened place had my heart from the moment I walked in. The building is grand and magnificent like a fort. After walking in, one is awestruck by the ambience and vibe. We took a table on the rooftop which is very artfully done with a lot of plants and greenery. There is ample seating yet the place was full. The menu is very graphic and quite innovative so each dish can be easily understood. The server helped us decide our order and the food was great overall. In drinks, I tried LIIT and one of the signature cocktails but they weren't to my liking. Would definitely visit again to try other items! "
400,"Very nice place.. fast service.. we went there for indo*pak match so no music was there.. will be back for more.. chole tacos are nice..and it's not in the mall, next to decathlon.."
401,"Gastropub- Noida.. no doubt ultra modern avtaar of Sutra gastropub... I had been to Sutra-cyberhub and had been fan of their super menu.. even their khichdi was superb but this place menu is totally different. it is ultra modern, fusion Indian Menu.¬†I totally enjoyed the new decor and ambience,, live music itself an attraction of the day. It is massive space spread across to multiple floors.¬†we tried following Murg bharwaan lahori, Mango ginger chicken, Tuna sushi, litti cum sutra and fish tikka. each and every dishes have great flavour.. presentation part itselt a top notch.. even their drinks list is huge n fabulous..services was professional and attentive.¬†Thanks!!"
402,"Perhaps the best place I have been to or it was just the friends company, nice rooftop sitting space, loud music and good food. Live music guys sing all time hits and makes this place interesting."
403,Love the Place Sutra -The Gastropub. The ambience was so nice each and every corner of this place is designed very thoughtfully. Tried this place last Sunday the crowd was amazing and the Live music üòç I loved it . Although I didn't like the DJ it was not that energetic.But the band was pretty Good.Now come to the Food when we went they served us a mango tart as a gesture in a very nice box and we ordered Mushroom bruschetta the order came very late almost after 30 mins. And dish was not that good.But ya I loved the place ‚ò∫Ô∏è 
404,"Having its own private building built in 20000 sq.ft. One should definitely visit this place @sutra_noida, Its a super massive place. What a great and amazing  food (ESPECIALLY ORIENTAL) and lovely ambiance too."
405,"I love Sutra the Gastropub restaurants in general. They, most often than not, have ridiculously nice decor, good service, but very casual diners and reasonable menus. Thus, Indian Restaurant does not disappoint. You get complimentary side dishes, and it has well stocked bar ... so get classy.I'm particularly fond of the way they do some of their vegetarian dishes - their Mini Masala Dosa has a distinctive nutmeg twinge, and the Potted Puchkas rarely produces leftovers for me! Plus, love their Spicy PotAnnnnd they deliver. Perfect to go on a Sunday for dinner to enjoy the dishes.. on the lovey day."

407,Sutra is the worst club i have ever been. The ambience is really low and dull. The food quality is pathetic. Service is extremely poor. We ordered various foods items and they were served after one hour. The plates were not provided. It felt like the waiters were confused. Drinks were diluted.cutlery was provided 15 minutes after the food was on table.Managers were without any experience and there was a chaos.After having food we went on the dance floor. We were 6 guys then their manager Bhuvan came to us with bodyguards and said stag entry is not allowed. I mean what kind of club is this which allow stag entries to enter have food and drinks but not allow people to be on the dance...read more
408,"It could not get lower than this. Worst service ever. Took 15 minutes to explain the order. The waiters forgot to provide plates. Other cutlery came after 3-4 reminders.Alcohol was diluted with water. Bills were inflated, yet they dared to ask for service charges. Hats off to establishing new lows for the industry"
409,Great place. Amazing Ambience.Noida finally had a good pub with great crowd and lit dancefloor.The dj is great and plays a mix of songs with does not get boring like it usually does in other pubs.The food menu has a variety of fancy things and the food tastes so good you'll wanna eat again.Everything is great. Do try this place.
410,"Really amazed with th food and service , keep it up th good hospitality ..Will visit this outlet again soon ..! Good luck team and management ."
411,Ambience and Music were a great attraction. A must go to place for music and food lovers. The DJ was playing really good beats which I never expected. The rooftop was my go to but you will definitely like the place altogether.
412,"Well Sutra, GastroPub is new Addition in the Noida Sector 38. IT has pretty good, adorable and stunning decor. Ultra Modern with attentive services. Comfortable and inviting setting with well stocked bar and colorful lighting make you mesmerizing.Food and Beverage part is itself says a different stories - it is ultra modern, fusion and original.. too many thing have done curated wonderfully without compromising the taste n flavours. Peshawari mutton,Roasted chicken and ginger mango chicken are few... which is recommend in recent tasting sessions.¬†Drinks range is quite interesting with stunning flavouful cocktails."
413,"Thanks for wonderful evening.. Great Service by Sanjay Chauhan .. Visited the place today for Office get together, Had a superb experience.. Food was excellent/ Service was excellent "
414,"Wow Place..!! This is undoubtedly, one of the biggest night club in noida. Its ambience is so amazing and the view from the roof top is just mind blowing. Even the song numbers being played there were rocking. The presentation of food, the atmosphere, crowd everything was just up to the mark. A bit slow in there services though, but the food taste is scrumptious. Overall, will definitely visit again. "
415,"The best place to visit near gardens galleria it's an awesome place to be with your friends and family. Good ambience and awesome food would definitely suggest , friendly staff"

417,"This is a really great Indian restaurant. The food is so good. Lots of Food options. The three course deal is a great deal. And the customer service is excellent.

Always a great place to eat.¬†Too many option are choose from mango ginger chicken,Roasted chicken and Chicken Biryani. etc."
418,Modern Indian Cuisine and Fusion was SO GOOD! I will definitely be back for Dinner OFTEN. My Cousin and I and some friends went for their lunch and I just did not want to get full! All the flavors are making me hungry now just thinking about it. Please try this place! The 3 course Meal cost us around 4000 for 5 - WORTH IT. There were a lot of vegetarian options but also a good range Non Vegetarian options. One of my favorite things were the Ginger mango chicken and - Peshawari mutton. I can't wait to eat here again!

Unfortunately, I'd never made it for dinner until recently.  A fairly large group of friends showed up for a friend's birthday dinner.  Service was reasonable as we got some drinks, apps and Mains.For the dinner, I got an assortment of tandoori and curry dishes along with more Naan.  Everything was cooked well and had a ton of flavor as expected from Indian food.  Overall, the food was wonderful.  I don't think anyone was disappointed.

It does take a little longer for the food to be served, but they note that on the menu, the food tastes very fresh, and it's worth the wait. Drinks were again fabulous... dont compare with ambience and decor.. its simply awesome and miles ahead to other in similar region. I cant recommend highly enough!!"
430,I visited this place twice already with second time being with my team of 17 folks including visitors from US. We all had a great time here! This place isn't comparable to any other and best I have seen in Noida. The ambience and decor is of international standard. The library zone next to the bar is my favorite corner. The rooftop and further up second level rooftop were surprisingly cool despite the heat wave as they have installed high capacity air coolers. The dance floor and stage is right in the center and interestingly one can see the stage performance on ground floor from second rooftop too! The food is by a speciality chef. To top it all their staff is service oriented and...read more
431,"We've been fans of this restaurant for years (in CyberHub)and we are so happy that it's close to home!  Although we always been to cyber hub, I think the restaurant has a great atmosphere.  We order the same dishes every time, but they are so good, why change?  Recommend: Murg bharwaan lahori, Roasted chicken thigh is marinated and filled with spices n herbs.  I love the fish tikka which is a my fav dish.  We also sometimes get Mango Chicken, which the seasonal dish with flavour of mango infused with chicken quality can be hit or miss.  The chicken biryani is awesome.  Daal Makhni n Garlic Naan is always a favorite and the rice is delicious as well.  We will have to venture out and...read more"
432,"Just to write good reviews would not do Justice to the beauty of this place.

They have hired the right people for the right job, its an unbelievable combination of great ambiance with great food and with great service.

437,"I've eaten in Indian restaurants all over the NCR, including quite a bit of time in Gurgaon, and this is first rate in This Mall. We had the Mango Ginger Chicken and Mutton with Paratha, which were outstanding. They give copious portions, everything is super tasty, and the staff is as friendly as you could ever want. Next time we visit NOIDA, returning here will definitely be on our list. At many Indian restaurants, too many of the dishes all taste the same. They all tasted very different here."
438,"This place has amazing live music, and the food they serve is really good. The waiter who attended on us went by the name of Brij Bhushan Pandey.

441,"I really wanted to eat at Sutra Gastropub-CuyberHub but the wait was too long so we ended up trying Sutra Gastropub-Noida for dinner instead since it's across the region. I'm so glad that we did that because this was the best Indian food I've ever had. We ordered the mango ginger chicken, seekh and kebab, and Chicken Biryani. Everything was so flavorful and well seasoned compared other Indian restaurants we have been to. The murgh bharwaan lahori was thick and paired well with the naan. The service was attentive and quick. We finished everything and enjoyed the meal so much that I already asked other friends to come try Sutra Gastropub-Noida with me."
