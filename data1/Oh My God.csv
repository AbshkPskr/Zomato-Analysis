0,"The lighting is very dim, we couldn't even read the menu. The staff was rude. When they got our order wrong and made the wrong pizza, instead of apologising or making a new one, they slightly altered what they already made and claimed to have made it from scratch. The spring rolls were good but the experience was ruined for us. "

Follow my food journey on insta: @a_bite_of_yummie"
10,"I have been there twice or thrice, the thing I like most there is live music. One of the most happening cafe with extensive menu of Connaught Place. Wish to be there again and again. I tried there non veg chicken platter and virgin mojito, all were good in taste. Hygiene was taken care and they do timely service. Parking is not problem here because you are in CP. The only thing which they can improve is pricing."

37,We visited this place for tuesday dinner through dineout GIRF. We had Veg Soya Chaap that was crunchy and good in taste with enough quantity. Veg Spring Rolls were great as well. For mocktails we had Virgin Mojito that was nicely blended. For main course we had Dal Makhni that was yummy and¬†Tandoori Roti that was crispy. Live music made our evening more special but it was loud. The place has ample seating space.
38,"I have always loved spending my time there, the most amazing dish that they serve is Chilli Chicken. Their food is mouth watering. The staff is courteous too."
39,One of the worst place to visit in connaught place.
40,"We have been visiting this restaurant for sometime now and never had a bad experience. The staffs are well trained and the food is good as well. good place to hangout with friends,"
41,"I have been here 2-3 times., The usp of this place is live singing every time .I can sit here for hours just listening to the songs , the staff is also good and courteous , the food is good but I find their prices on higher side still will love to comeback again"
42,Good ambienceService is goodFood is good
43,"This place is located at a prime location next to many major pubs and stores. Have been here twice and got to experience live music both the times. However my second visit was a dull one. The music was exceptionally loud and there was no christmassy appeal to the place on Christmas Eve, just some mild decor. We asked to lower the volume or provide us seating where sound wasn't that high, they had no such alternative, so I had to exit after my drinks. Tried LIIT and loved it. Passion fruit and forbidden fruit were decent and Moscow mule was fine too. Chicken and chives dimsums were prepared well and served with regular dimsum sauces.One of the favourites was khada masala murgh served in a...read more"
44,We ordered dahi ke sholey and spring rolls and Oreo milk shakes. Everything was good. Their ambience was good. Will love to visit this place again in future.
45,I was their with my friends and felt very nice their... Food was also delicious... Only I could not find dj their... That was must... But all over it's a nice place ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
46,"Visited cafe OMG today, it's a decent place, with very good live music. They also serve sheesha & drinks. Food was okaish, the staff was not good, really bad experience. Ambiance was great, with ample seating space. To be honest, there are better cafe's in CP than this, wouldn't recommend."
47,This place never disappoints me. I was just roaming around with my friend when i heard a soulful voice from.cafe omg and i couldn't resist going. The live music was the best part of the cafe. The ambience is 4/5 .We ordered sex on the beach cocktail and peach ice tea. Peach ice tea was not upto the mark.
48,one of the better cafes that i have been to all these years...more so because of the live singing that happen almost every day...the DJ seemed a bit rude ...the ambience becomes electrifying on weekends...food is decent also...the malai tikka was nice and tender...nice way to present it with the burning coals and the meat still sizzling on the table...the fish tikka was decent as well...the dal makhani was however passable...service is top notch and they take of you well...
49,A good place to hangout with friends... The ambience is very good and the staffs know their menu very well for sure. loved the live music as well. Will come back sometime soon
50,"The ambience is great, live music was good, the food was also good. I've been here 4-5 times. You can visit here to have a good experience in affordable price."
51,"The place is on the 2nd floor of the inner circle cp So first thing that you will notice as soon as you enter is the over load live music , no matter where you sit it will bother you üòÄ The prices of the drinks and food are reasonable A bottle of India wine would cost you about 1600 inr and a glass around 450 rs Food tasted average to me we ordered chakhna platter which was served in a cabbage leaves and we also ordered paneer tikka pizza which again I would say was okayish The ambiance has varied sitting arrangement with comfy sofa for group etc but place for 2 people are always between and are less spacious.I would rate the place as 3/5 overall"
52,"Good place, great service, nice music, supportable staff. Overall its a good place to visit with a group of friends."
53,Worst food ever. DO NOT VISIT.
54,The food was great and so were the drinks Friendly staff and provided good recommendations as well............Definitely going back soon.
55,The service is great. Deepak paaji thanks
56,"Apart from the vibe, service is prompt.Cheerz to our server Deepak"
57,"I wana give 5 star rating here just because of only one person and his name is Mr. Vinod Who is front office staff in this bar, Very understable person here... We are regular visitor here just because of him. Every thing is perfect to have it here. "
58,The staff is not at all courteous and cooperative. They don't know how to deal with the customer and make their experience a better one.
59,It is one of the best place to be at! 
60,It was a great experience. Thanks to vinod for exceptional service :)
61,Presentation of panner tikka was so good 
62,"The ambience of this place is extremely lively. The live music was the best part of our dinning experience at OMG.We ordered an Ice tea, cold coffee, dahi k kabab and plain nachos.The food was good but nothing extraordinary. "
63,Good place to enjoy . Chinese platter is too good . Deepak is very good and too frndly love ü§ìLive music is good
64,"Very shady place where rude, inattentive staff will serve you stale food. Music at this place was just a loud noise. Everything at this place is disappointing. Not recommended at all."
65,The worst cafe one could ever go to. The manager and the waiter- Deepak were so rude and arrogant. They don't know how to behave with their customers. Horrible rude staff. Learn some hospitality OMG. Manager is their to solve problems not to create more problems.
66,Highly unprofessional people. The manager and the Staff misbehaves and manhandles their customers. They are so rude and arrogant. Won't recommend this place to anyone. Highly illogical people working there.
67,Ambience- 5/5Servive- 4/5Food- 3.5/5The ambience was good. This place really has a huge space with interiors having a good lot of yellow and red lightening. You can enjoy your food with a good live music.The only thing that was disappointing was the food. The 'wow' factor was missing. The food was not up to the mark.The staff was really cooperative and cordial with us!!!!
68,I went to this place for my birthday party on Thursday. Fortunately there was a band performing that day and it was amazing. Food was also great. Specifically I liked the way they served Paneer tikka. Chinese Platter was also really greatm Our waiter Deepak was also polite and good(he asked to mention his nameüòÖüòÖüòÖ)
69,"very slow service .Despite being a personal party with a fixed menu they refused to serve dessert in between ,the reason being their policyAt 930 in the night after having  snacks, u have to have main course to get the ice cream for which u have already paid. Most pathetic place in cp. I don‚Äôt know the name of the waiter but he was so rude and disinterested. Will give zero star."
70,A very happening and chill out place to hangout with anyone. Specially the live singing and musicü§© on Saturday and Sundayüç∑ #tagtalk
71,I visited this place on a weekday yet it was beyond my expectations. The place was lit with some great live music. The service was top notch with Mr. Deepak assisting us the whole time and being professional at his duties.Chicken salt and pepper is a must have at this place.I'll be visiting here soon and recommend everyone to visit the place too! 
72,Had a gr8 tym..... our table was attended by Deepak who was very welcoming in nature.... really gr8 service and kudos to the restaurant and Deepak‚Äôs service 
73,Had a great time with friends and excellent service by deepak.Would recommend chicken salt n pepper. Live music was bonus with special request bein accepted to be played. Nice dark ambience.
74,One of the best cafe in Town and awesome service by Mr.deepak and we try Chieken solt and paper that was really awesome and pasta was also good.

77,Amazing interiors nd well behaved staff makes Ur experience great ...a must place to re visit again ..good food nd classy music along with the courteous staff which make up happy 
78,Ambience is so good n I like the love music thing as well but the important thing food is not good at all. Their service is very slow n the food quantity is also very less. 
79,"This is pure cheating...when you are providing with 50% through payment of 50rs per person and you are provided with 5-10 items in a separate menu to chose from which has no pizza, pasta, chinese, etc. and you are just embarrassed in a group. These restaurants are trying to be oversmart but they should know that customer is kingpin and without us they are a big 0...."
80,"I liked the place as a whole, the ambiance was nice, good crowd, but the staff was not as friendly and helpful as should be. "
81,You would enter this place and have slightly higher expectations than what you see. The furniture is not at all what they wanted it to look like. It looks like cheap pieces from a flea market that are just thrown in for sale or something... There's no coordination or flow of design.The food :Below average with very small quantities.Served in rusty brass like dishes which are actually corroded and look extremely dirty and old. It's ratger disgusting to eat from such a plate.Taste -Spring rolls - less quantity as per price but taste was ok.Veg Manchurian + Fried rice - one of the worst I've ever had.Mutton Rara + Garlic Naan - Naan was really good but mutton was okayish.The beer...read more
82,Deepak is a charm‚ô•Ô∏è his service is exceptional..  food was as good as heaven.. live music look me to mid 20‚Äôs.. best service anyone can ever get
83,"Bad service. We purchased a dine out coupon for 50% off, the manager over here didn't informed us that the menu for dineout is different from the original menu. After making the payment they provided the different menu which does not have any options."
84,"When I entered this place, i was like OMG,the vibe, the live music, the people and the food.But yes service is little poor, you need to get little strict there but it's worth spending.. In frame, Chilli garlic Noodles (all time fav) and Chicken tikka chat (mouth watering)The walls of this cafe are so amazing that you'll definitely like every corner of it."
85,"Getting a space in CP on a Sunday, that too Friendship's day wala Sunday is truly a blessing in disguise!Oh my God was generous enough to cater us and we had a nice time except for a few bumps.The service is muffled, I guess it was a busy day hence everything was being held on a very thin thread. We sat near to the Bar at the corner where A/C wasn't effective at all and they could just not care of our complaints!We order Veg Noodles with Manchurian, Fusilli Pesto pasta, Cappuccino, Choco Cookie Shake and Banana Oreo Shake.Veg Noodles with Manchurian : Manchurian was tasty and quantity was nice. Felt the noodles were undercooked.Fusilli Pasta : It was cooked well and wasn't too...read more"
86,"Their concept of music is different then mine, i believe it was just noise. I felt this place is for oldies and Ashiq kind of people, anyway everything else was just fine and it's cheap also."
87,Nice place good ambience. The singer was fab. The speakers were great.Good and variety of food. Love to visit again.Situated at great place just above chaayos
88,The best in class place for food and drinks is here! It's cannought place Delhi and this place is just fab!!! AMBIENCE !!1. The place has indoor seating but it's comparatively small over other places in the place2. The bar table makes the place look good.3. Occasional live music is organised by the outlet.!! GOODS !!1. The taste of food here is great.2. The presentation is good.3. Veg cuisines are highly recommend.!! BADS !!1. The service time should be improved.2. I found the place a bit more dark than other places.!! REVIEW !!This is a proper lunch/dinner place for please who like drinks with food. The live music is a major attraction here.
89,Place is good location wise but sitting arrangements and staff and counter for bar just poor looks like gangster run the place .Don't go here much better places are there
90,This is a cafe worth visiting during the weekend in Cp for sure.My visit wasn‚Äôt planned but when I reached I got to know they gave zomato 2+2 also which made our day and we ordered fries n onion rings to be at safe side. Sauces along side were too good and fries were crunchy as I like it. Overall music was good and ambience was great and classy.Would love to visit cafe omg again soon. Food - awesomeMusic - greatAmbience - greatStaff - lazy but food make it up to you.
91,The place is above chaayos in cpWe booked our table by dineout for 20% discount so lookout for that.We went in the afternoon it wasn't much crowdedAmbience- Ambience was okayish not wow.

92,"Great place with nice ambience. The only thing that bothered about ambience is that the corner sofas seemed to be totally different places as neither AC or music were good enough there.The food was average, we had crispy cheese corn, paneer tikka pizza, red sauce pasta & non veg platter all were fine.Service was really good. Dj was superb & the dance platform was spacious enough.So, definitely a good to go place for a party."
93,"Probably the best place in whole C.P which is underated for sure, had a great time, it's lives upto almost every expectations with great food too. My must try's are Chinese Platter and Cocktails."
94,"I was their in a birthday party it,s a good place for a group to hangout nice music a band was playing that day , good vibes and the food was also good."
95,Sitting seat not comfortable....beer price great....!!!!.....Come here just with friends and groups not with the partner..live music good....ambie is also good
96,"So last Sunday I went here with my friends. The ambience was good staff was very polite however I felt disappointed with the food.It was bland,the shake we ordered was also not that much delicious."
97,worst experience ever in any restaurant.service boy was really lazy. He was not attended but caring female customers. I recall him many times for what I ordered but he was not courteous 
98,Amazing place and atmosphere.. I celebrated my birthday here yesterday and i loved it.. I loved the crowd and specially the singer @shivamluthra was amazing..
99,I been to this place for the first time. And shivam on the live music was excellent and we enjoyed a lot because of shivam. And food was amazing and everything was good but. Shivam sings like atif. And anmol bouncer behaives very polite. 
100,This place is good for nothing.Charging 800 rs for single veg and non veg. And what will you get? Disappointment.Pls dont go there unless or untill you are extravaganza.
101,"Place with courteous staff and great ambience. Food was good. Must go place with friends. And also check out for the events, you may get singers performing here. "
102,Great place. Had a very good dining night with my friends. Such a breezy evening for all of us. Food and ambience are fantastic.Must visit place
103,"Ambience and live music is quite good, 5 üåü for that but the food is not upto the mark. But one should try their white sauce pasta that's quite decent."

105,Cafe oh my God is an Okaish place. Not that lively. Chinese is good. Italian is ok ok. Shakes are good. Not as great as other cafes in Connaught place. 
106,"Manager was rude, we were 6 and he denied us table even when we had a confirmed booking through zomato just because he was not ready to provide zomato gold benefits.It was a pathetic experience. "
107,"Good place with live music and fine ambience, chicken tangri were well cooked but little spicy. Zomato gold i used here. Can go here again too"
108,Went there for my 25th birthday with friends and had such a lovely time. Music was awsm dj is really good food is average not so good. Ambience is really good and safe. Hookha is on fire üî•
109,"Nice ambience, The server was really helpful and polite which made our experience better ! Though the food is little expensive and drinks are cheap because of the deals ! So the bill comes okayish "
110,This place has got a huge space. I went there to celebrate my friends birthday. Live performance was there at night.We ordered many things and all the things were good in taste. Staff was cooperating and was very helpful.We got some discount as well on our bill.It's a must try place. üëç
111,The best thing about this place is food n then services. The guy was really humble n polite n he looked after us really well n even helped us with choosing what was best. Live music was next best thing there. 
112,"Well, the food is really good, but i wish i cud say the same for the management. I usually use magicpin voucher as i am a frequent user of the application. First thing that i hated is ,when i asked which beer is available, waiter only told me the names of imported beers. Since the prices were extremely high i did not order any. After a while i saw some other waiter serving domestic beer to table next to me. I really wonder why these places use such cheap tricks to increase revenue.A hint to owner-Staff require proper training. Hospitality and fulfilling needs of a person is the key to a successful eatery."
113,"Visited in oh my god for lunch. We were entertaining friends,and enjoyed our table. We enjoyed the air conditioning üòä. I just want to say that, in addition to a nice meal, we had a delightful waiter.He had just the right balance of friendliness and efficiency.He recognised that we wanted time to visit and did not rush us. He and other staff members made certain that we had everything we needed. Please give our thanks to the Manager(s) and others for the wonderful food and the ambience was so woww. I would definitely visit there again and already recommend my friends and family."
114,"It‚Äôs a good one of the cool and amazing place for some good drinks and chill.Ambience -vibe and have a good time with friends.. Food is great, staff was really helpful‚Ä¶music was great,,"
115,One of the worst experiences. Staff ignores you when you want to order something. Sitting in restaurant waiting for bill from last 45 minutes
116,"Went today with my friend, loved the ambience, food and courteous staff. We ordered veg white sauce pasta, Red wine and Pineapple mocktail... extra star for the lovely singer (live music), he even asked us our special requests and very courteous staff! üòä"
117,"I was looking for a place with decent vocal music and ambience amidst the bustling inner circle of CP. I visited there with my friends who I met after after a few years, hence the choice.I reached there about half hour earlier than my friends but inspite of not ordering then, I was treated well by the staff.Later we ordered some beer and LIIT, Non veg platter in which the chicken tikka was particularly outstanding. Also we had Murgh Tikka Khada masala which was brought in a clay pot with a few small pieces of smouldering charcoal.The presentation of the Murgh Tikka was asthetically pleasing and with light vocal music it made the perfect place to hangout with close ones.PS: the...read more"
118,Ambience 4.5 /5Service 4/5Food 3.5/5Pretty tough to find this pub. It's quite confusing to say the least. The place is quite big though. Interiors are really good lot of yellow and red.Service was good and they were able to understand the offers we were interested in.Food and drinksWe had 6 shots of 100 pipers and chilly potatoes. They even get us free peanuts üôÇ
119,An incredible spot to appreciate for unrecorded music better cusine and have an extraordinary situation to appreciate and have an incredible staff.Food here is very delicious.Schezwan chicken rice and chicken tikka khada masala is an absolute necessity try.Good service.Wide assortment of beverages and food.Just love the vibe.
120,"Worst place to come over. They have their own rules and regulations. Waiter over here are way too arrogant, have no decency. I will never recommend a person to come here if you really want to have a good time and don‚Äôt want to spoil your mood."
121,Great place to visit...... Great place to hangout with frnds....food is good .....Awesome hospitality by jaipal singh rawat. Thanks man... specially live music...
122,"Sunday night and you are at Cp, either you need pre-booking or you are spoilt for choices be it cuisines or Ambience or music.. I mean options and choices are innumerable! We got out of the metro station and heard live music and voila we were there for our Sunday night dinner.  The singer and music was just lovely. It was crowded but funn night. Everyone was enjoying!  Food was lovely and the service was quick! The only thing was that you need to shout your lungs out for any communication as the music is quiet on a higher pitch and the sitting is like right there at or around the music area :( Food was delicious and a special mention to FISH which was just amazing! "
123,"It was really a nice experience in oh my God , CP. Ambience was good, the live music made it a good place to drink and eat. Mocktails were very nice, and I ordered nachos, pizza , moctails and beer. I liked nachos there. This place made my day"
124,"Finally went to cp after a really long time and went to oh my god!The ambience was great, the singer had a great voice and made the aura even more enjoyable:)I ordered non-veg platter which had fish, chicken and mutton. All of them tasted amazing and were delicious!The one mark that I‚Äôm deducting is because i felt the prices were a bit high as per the quantity. "

128,"Had lunch with my friends, service was awesome, we had a delightful experience. Food was delicious, specially paneer tikka pizza. Schezwan fried rice were little spicy. Overall it was good.Service - 5/5Taste - 5/5"
129,It‚Äôs a good place to kill the dull vibe and have a good time with friends. It has a chilling ambience with not so good staff service. Food is great. You might wanna have their pizzas and pastas . Other than that their honey chilli potatoes and nachos are great. For beverages you should go for their Oreo Shake if you don‚Äôt wanna have hard liquor. Though their brownie was disappointing but over all it was a good experience. 
130,The staff was polite and the music was amazing. Special shout out to Prince. Thanks for making us feel comfortable. It's a place where you can come and relax.

So if you are catching up on a friend for a casual chit chat, this place may not be your best pick.The crowd here is mostly youngsters. The service is speedy and the wait staff is polite. Prince Chaudhary is one of the most courteous workers here. Food and drinks are also good."
143,Ambience is awesome do try Omg's special chilly chicken and the live music inside makes the whole atmosphere awesome... Do visit the place..
144,"OH MY GOD : A terrible experience to be at this place, the staff is rude, full of unjustified attitude! , they impose a compulsory 10% service charge if you are a zomato gold customer, when asked to levy they ask you to leave in a very rude tone. Moreover never order mocktails or cocktails if you are applying any deal or zomato gold, they serve highly compromised drinks just because you have applied zomato gold. Only visit if you are willing for a compromised evening. P.S- the only attraction is live music, which fools people to enter. A black mark on service industry.Please read other reviews with similar experience before checking in this place, all the 5 star reviews are duped and...read more"
145,Food was good but their helpers were not good at behavior. When we asked to remove service tax which was included in the bill. He suddenly started brhaving very weird and talked very rudely. These people are being trained for extra money not for good servicing.

On Sunday night at around 10:30 pm we were total 5 people went to OMG just wanted to explore some music and dance floor. Since none of us drink so we ordered few cokes and a veg-starter making a total bill of around Rs700. After half an hour when we were done with it and were enjoying the ambience and music, two waiters came to us one by one insisting us to order more and when we said, we don‚Äôt want anything else now, one of them told that they are making the bill now and we need to leave.

170,"Visited this place with my friends. The food is good, service is nice, seating is decent and its kids-friendly. The only problem we had was there music. They had live music, the singer was good but the music was too loud. We were unable to talk to each other even the waiters were communicating through writing as they could us hear us and take the order. All the customers were again and again telling the waiters to low the volume but all in vain. We even requested the singer but he said he already informed the management that the volume should be low as then people will enjoy it more. But no one listened to him. The management needs to understand that when there is a live music,where...read more"
171,"I went here for a casual dinner. The live music was amazing, but the waiters were very very rude!!They acted very impolite with every one of us, didn't care to serve food properly.Although, I liked the place and especially the live music, but the waiters made the experiences very unpleasant for me."
172,place have live music food is pretty affordable and tasty drinks are fine . ambience is very good also have live projectors for ipl and worldcup matches
173,If u want to party and that too in pocket friendly way. Then this is the best place. One important thing i have observed here is that bouncers pay utmost attention on the behaviour of the crowd.If they figure out something indecent and inappropriate. They will kick u out
174,"Visited this place 3-4 times on Saturday nights,Awesome place, with full packed Saturday's having live music and dj.Good serviceWide variety of drinks and food.Just love the ambience."

177,"Had visited this place with some colleagues. The food and drinks are decently priced and tased okay.We had ordered liit, cosmopolitan some beers. The music was too loud for our liking and inspire if requesting multiple times nothing happened "
178,"Music was too loud, not all item available as listed in menu. Ambience was not upto the mark, bad furniture and service was pathetic.. Need to improve the service"
179,A sweet place to hangout with frnds....We went on a live music session which was great followed by an amazing dj....The food and drinks were great....I liked the option of customized pizza where you can chose from multiple options....We also ordered chilli potato which had great taste...A very nice place for chilling with frnds

188,Oh my god!!!!! FoodOh my god!!!! AmbienceOh my god!!!! StaffOh my god!!!! live musicAnd that's why this place is called OMG CAFEI would like to visit again just because of live music and food alsoAnd yass nice place it is
189,"It's just another gloomy & claustrophobic place with not much happening according to what we witnessed. Music wasn't that great (non-popular songs were playing on repeat mode).. ambiance was a bit a Shady and dark. Red lamination on window glass added more shady glamour to this dingy place. Honestly we went there as one of us had got a deal for this place, Staff was non-courteous, Rude or maybe we went on Sunday and she was the only server (poor girl) in entire place.  Multiple times we have to make staff aware of the deal, they took long time accepting the deal, then noting down codes & no one even offered water to our group‚Ä¶ Pathetic. This all put a very bad taste, food was also...read more"
190,"The food was good. Really liked the chicken spring rolls and the soya kebab. Both the dishes were so soft that it melted in our mouth. Chilly potato could have been improved. The drinks were okay, not very strong.Washrooms - better than average. Food -Tasty Must try -chicken spring rolls "
191,Food is good.They have availability issue with beers even on weekdays and also cocktails were not too good.But the food compensates for it.
192,One of the best virgin mojito that I ever had...Chicken tikka was really great in tasteAnd best part you can choose your toppings for pizza'sOver all ambience is good a great place to hangout ...
193,A very good lounge with interiors furnished with cushy red couches and curvy wooden bar. Great music will set your mood and you will feel happy and pleased while being served here. Prompt service with good staff makes this place customer friendly. Recommend dishes would be Paneer tikka and veggie pizza with any mocktail. Penne pasta and crispy honey potato are also delightful.
194,"Food here is great..and they serve good quantities. But they don't have many beer options. Plus, they don't have desserts. I visited twice in 3 days and enjoyed the ambiance n service.¬†They even gave us complimentary kamikaze shots!"
195,Do not go there if you are a Zomato gold user... apparently they have different rules for gold customers. Service charge is compulsory for gold customers..
196,Went there for a quick lunch and didn‚Äôt find anything good other then ambience ....The ambience was good but the poor lighting made it bad ...The service staff was not at all polite and didn‚Äôt looked happy when we told them that we have a booking from dineout girf festival ...Replied very rudely when asked about roof top seating ...Most of the beer was not available from the menu ...Honey chilly potato was just okay ... lababdar paneer was good in taste ...Forceful service tax of 10% imposed ....Not worth time and money ...
197,Amazing place with good ambience and delicious food.Cherry on the cake is live music.I had been there more than 5 times. Everytime i witness something new.
198,"Oh My God !!!OMG is an awesome place where you can enjoy food, drinks and live music. Went here on new year eve. They had live music that day and i enjoyed & loved the live session. One of the best thing about this restaurant is it is very much spacious. The staff is well trained & humble. Their service was on point. I ordered masala peanuts, fried corns and beer.So, the ratings are like this :Taste : 5/5Presentation : 5/5Hygiene : 5/5Staff : 5/5Service : 5/5Value for money : 5/5"
199,"I tried Omg tandoori nonveg platter ,that was good it Includes ajwaini fish tikka,bhoot jhulakia #chicken drumsticks, mutton seekh kabab,murg malai tikka ,so it is a perfect platter for #nonveg lovers üòã"
200,I loved the place the ambience was good and the food also tasted really great.I love the live music it was going just with the mood.the place made me happy .Best place to hangout with friendsAmbience -4/5Food- 3.5/5Service-4/5
201,Total chaos. Inefficient way of handling people waiting at the bar for seats.They dont have any waiting list to keep a check on the people waiting in the house and assign them seats in no particular order.
202,Total mismanagement!!! Classic example of chaos .  We were told to wait at bar till seats are available. Manager didn‚Äôt keep check on number of people waiting at bar.Manger was not sure as to who came first and who came later and the seats were assigned without taking that into consideration. Poor hospitality 
203,"5*****This is the first time i amGiving 5 stars to any restaurant/Cafe Small place but it was very comfortable nice cute fancy decor,food was delicious drinks were fine and the service was top notch that guy was so humble and professional and the band was like icing on the cake Ambience 4.5/5Food  5/5Service:5:5Music 5/5Definitely i will come again "
204,I have there twice. On second time i missed the roof top ambience but the inner ambience is good too . Drinks were good and food was properly cooked and delicious. Deducting a star for little better services as scope for improvement.
205,"Food was okay and service was really great, (miss Meenu) nice place to hang out with friends. Will revisit to enjoy the services and will be hopping for better taste next time "
206,"Alright, the pictures shown in the app are bright and beautiful; but, its the complete opposite in their, maybe because we had shown up a little late at around 10. The food was not so good; except Gulati Kabab, we ordered chilly garlic rice and chilly paneer and a pizza. The music was so darn loud, we were just not able to talk. I dont know why. We even had to shout for our orders in the ears of the guy, who was standing next to us.The staff on the other hand was great and spontaneous. I may just skip it the next time I visit connaught place."
207,"Beautiful Ambience!! I had my community meet-up arranged over here, no doubt on the choice as such an amazing services was there. Each and every food the group ordered was literally mouthwatering and a lot of drinks, I couldn't resist myself. Perfect place for party it got cool interior different lightings. Had a lot of masti#partydestination #meetup #delicious #fun"
208,"Nice place Had chilly potato and pizza both were yumm..Then in main course dal makhni, kadhai paneer and naan. Taste was well balanced in each thingnot very spicy.Ambience was nice. Staff was also polite"
209,"A great place to hangout with live music in the background. The staff is super friendly and the food is delicious. Drinks are very pocket friendly and for sure, your overall experience at this place would be worthy."
210,The ambience was good. But they don't have many options in beer. The sitting area is quite large. The service was good. And the music and lights were great.
211,"Amazing place to visit, specially on weekdays. Live Band will surely help you to throw out your pressure.  Must a visit place. Saturday nights are more amazing in comparison to other days."
212,"Anyone who is familiar with CP‚Äôs happening life, knows where to go for their libation drink. And CP has plenty of such gastro pubs, cafes, joints, lounges. And one such superlative place is OMG. Well, we all know the best time to visit there is Friday evening (yes, corporate thug life :P) because the bands that perform are momentous but the place is also lit on all other days. Starters are a good mouthful start ÔÅä. No chef‚Äôs special on the menu really, but everything is decent. It has both counter and lounge seating. In addition, it gives you the zomato gold 1+1 privilege. All in all, good seating with well-informed service."
213,Average Place..Quite Dark...Limited Menu...(Do Check menu on Zomato before you head to this place).Live music...Untrained but courteous Staff...Parking area is close. 
214,The staff was very cooperative and it was. Peaceful place and must visit with friends ro hangout and pasta was of a great taste and just the quantity of the food was a bit less according to the price
215,"So i visited this place on 22nd January. Food was not good plus staff was rude. Moreover, music was way too high and they were reluctant to slow it down. Overall experience was not good."
216,"The best place ever! Starting from the ambience, seating arrangement to food & drink options almost everything was fabulous. Music is good. Usually live music is dull and boring but this was the first time that we had such a great time with the live music. The female singer was such a wonderful artist, the crowd was not that appreciative though. Service was prompt, food and drinks tasted good, pricing is just the best thing you can ask for. The only thing which could improve is the service staff, other than that I think we have found our ""THE PLACE"" to hangout. "
217,"This place was a chance discovery while looking for a place with a stag entry on a Saturday night in Connaught Place. For starters, no pun intended, the place isn't quiet so if the idea is of a peaceful dinner, this place is not it.However, Oh My God does have its positives. The alcohol menu isn't very expensive so it doesn‚Äôt pinch. The fact that the place accepts Zomato Gold only makes the whole deal simpler. Coming to the food, though we‚Äôd ordered only starters, the food is nothing to write home about. It is not bad, but not excellent either. Our order included masala peanuts, chicken wings and mixed platter. The platter, specifically, was a little too oily. Masala peanuts is not...read more"
218,"Hate it! The service is shitty, the music is crappy, the food wasn‚Äôt up to the mark! They have their own rules for zomato codes and people waiting tables know no word like - respect! Definitely need a staff upgradation! And, assume the same for the dj, if you want to call them so!"
219,Staff was cooperative and very active. Music was cool. We have experienced the live performance which was awesome. After the live performance they played DJ with dhol........Perfect dance night. Also thanks for beautiful pictures.
220,Good hang out place but quite dark. U know what u r eating but u can hardly see it. Above all beer options were limited. But it's quite spacious. Service is good n polite.
221,"Nice place and Ambience. Live music was very great üëå. We ordered vada pav, pizza, honey chilli potato, oreo shake and some other mocktails. The food and drinks were quite good. The only minus point was that the lighting is too dim, even reading menu was a bit difficult task without mobile flash light."
222,Suggested by my friend from Delhi after we were denied stag entries ü§£ this was our last resort.They had live music that day and really enjoyed the session. The singer( I don't remember the name) was good .The service was good and food too.Ordered chilli chicken and some whisky really enjoyed my visit there.

224,Went this place on friday night . Though there was not too much crowd but live singing performance was there followed by dj.Staff was courteous and food was also good.Drinks availability was good.Ambience could be better as lights were quite dim.
225,"Price was double of MRP. 100% mark-up is too damn high. Live singer was damn good, his voice and style of singing very much like that of Atif Aslam."
226,Nice place for perfect evening. Service and the staff was good. Awesome food quality and the ambiance is ‚ù§Ô∏èThe best part was music üéµüéµüé∂üé∂
227,"What a vibecious evening it was. kudos to the ambience, food and live music. The best thing about this place is they play hindi music with retro numbers too. Food is ok and if you wanna get high try LIT pitcher of there's it awsome. "
228,Extremely bad experience- I was looking for a place to eat when I crossed F block and heard this amazing voice. I climbed the stairs following that voice and entered oh my god. The place was nice and they had live music. I ordered mushroom galauti and soup and decided to use my zomato gold on drinks after I get over with the soup. As soon as the order was given the singer said he was taking a break and someone else would sing in his place. This new guy started shreeking on the mike. It got from bad to worse and I pleaded the waiter to change my table because I could hear myself go deaf. The waiter refused to change my table or shut the guy up or cancel my order. If the place is all about...read more
229,"I went here with some of my office friends. We had Veg Pizza, White sauce pasta, masala peanuts and Chili Potato. Only Chili potato was ok ok, and rest 3 things were really good. We also had white beera as a drink and a cocktail called seven steps to hell. The drinks were nice. The staff who was looking for us, he heard the order and brought it wrongly. His behavior and attitude was really not good. He got angry and then we have to ask the manager to come inn and handle the situation. The staff did not realise the mistake, he was not ready to apologise. After half of our time in the lounge, then the manager changed our staff and then served us normally again. "
230,"It‚Äôs one of the famous places to visit in cp Delhi, though with time it‚Äôs getting older as new places are coming up with better ambience and menu. If you haven‚Äôt visited this place then I would recommend it ."
231,"Amazing place to go! Good food and ambience. Love the way they serve panner tikka. The staff is very friendly and helping, especially Meena. Would love to go again!"
232,"I thought this would be an average place but it turned out to be way better than my expectations. Their food and service was good. Do try ""make my own pizza and/or pasta"" thing. Their playlist was good too, all good songs from 90s got played when we were there! "
233,Went to this place on Monday and they had good live music! The ambience abd decor is pretty usual! Menu doesn't have much options but overall the experience was good since it was Monday. 
234,"Ambience is pretty raw which I personally liked a lot.The staff is well trained to handle guests, I just feel they can be more polite.Food is good but I found it a bit expensive when compared to taste.Also, the live music sessions are just awesome. "
235,Food and service was amazing..the ambience is so comfrtble.. food was yumm.. pocket friendly and loved the service given by the oh my god staff is best
236,I went with my friends yesterday there was a live band wid full of energy and the restaurant was packed that time nice service and the Manger Mr.Bhagwan Singh Rawat is seriously very Amazing will really come back. Loved the place
237,"Nice been here...Good food and music. Ultimate experience. Ambience is good.... Food is a cherry on the cake ,Prince Chaudhary was serving us, really good man he is...."
238,"Nice and average place,when we entered they were having a accustic artist playing sufi songs. Little over pricy bar as compared to places around in cannaught place. We ordered for peanut masala and soya chop the peanut masala was good but the soya chop seemed very bland and bugger peices of soya mince. They could work on their food options available."
239,They don't know the rule of zomato gold.. I used zomato gold for drinks and after that they added service charge on total bill and said me that its compulsory to pay if I used zomato gold
240,"Hello everyone. When I was in Delhi I visited this place. This place is located in Connaught Place , food was good ambiance was good . But I m disappointed for his staff behaviour they don‚Äôt know how to talk with a customer. "
241,I had truly lovely experience in this cafe. Everything was wonderful...... I ordered the garlic bread with cheese which was really great üëç Service was literally disappointed me and too much slow but KHUSHAL was managed this otherwise experience was amazing üòâ.....And the one ‚òùÔ∏è best thing was that The LIVE MUSIC üé∂ performed by SHIVAM LUTHRA was UNIQUE.....At last I loved this place and I recommend this to everyone at least one time you can visit here!!!!.....
242,Nice place to hang out and booze. One of the server prince chaudhary is an amazing guy and he would surely suggest the best options to hit. Must visit.
243,Its an ok place to be honest. Food was decent had ordered paneer pakora. Beer was semi chilled. Waiters seemed trying to be good but their lack of training was clear. Management was polite. Toilets were not too clean. 
244,"Located in a premium spot, certainly one can expect it to be an epitome of a bar ,but it's not. The vibes are right, the decorum is good but with untrained waiters and tasteless food you can't fathom what's the hype about this place. We've ordered the waiter's recommended best on the menu for starters and mains, but seems like they turned out to be an utter disaster. For starters we ordered 'Bhoot Jolokia chicken drumsticks' if we go by the name it should be too spicy but I couldn't even taste normal level of spiciness yet it was totally dry, tasteless drumsticks. For the mains as per waiter's recommendation we've ordered a continental dish, but it was more disaster than the drumsticks...read more"
245,"The service was great and I strongly recommend that you visit this place with your friends. Deepak Kumar our waiter was really amazing. Kudos, cheers!"
246,I visited the place yesterday eve.The staff was not customer supporting and friendly. They were not polite at all. They were providing only limited drinks that were much costlier. The stubborn manager argued n shouted and was keen to fight regarding not mentioning discount offer before generating bill as if generating a new discounted bill would land him to hell.. Seriously disappointed. 
247,Poor customer service and inconsiderate staff. Manager first offered us a table and then after an hour forced us to switch table and threw us in one cramped corner. Restaurant also denied to provide us Zomato gold benefits. Limited and poor variety of drinks available.
248,"OMG.. u will speak this after visited this place. Went there with college mates reunion & literally it was awesome to be in OMG. Crowd, music, drink & food.. all things were OMG "
249,"I used Zomato gold on Oh My God. I was told that service charge will be mandatory since I used gold. While I paid the service charge, Zomato chat support told me that it wasn't mandatory. Really disappointed with the staff of Oh My God"
250,Live music was good and the service by Mr. Vinod Adhikari was the the highest point of our visit. He was quick and considerate. Food was fine and the drinks also had nothing too great about them.
251,"Visit this place today only, but the place turned bad for us due to the so called Staff. Otherwise everything was perfect, food is delicious, ambiance, decor is too good.No doubt everything was great.But the speaking Style of staff, they don't how to take order, this is what you train to your staff, and this is the weekend we spent in Connaught place.Thank you for this bad service, never gonna come."
252,"i visited this place recently in last month of November when i was in Delhi..it is located in CP i went there with my cousins, food was good and tasty and ambiance is also good! but the one thing which is very pathetic is their staff!!! they actually don't know how to greet or talk with the customer their way of speaking is too worse.guys you are in hospitality industry u should know and teach your stewards how to talk and greet guests and customer.i was very much angry and wasn't expected this type of gesture from OMG!!"
253,Had good experience at OMG and the service provided by Meena was awsum.. we had pasta and some drinks.. had great fun.. would love to return again..
254,"It's sort of annoying when the staff is actually in their own trip! The services are slow. Very. Slow. The staff isn't well versed with the menu, they actually need to go and check whether they have some things available or not. Food ain't worth it either. I could have actually had a better time at Prime street cafe than this. "
255,This is good cafe have live music alsoFood I would say is fineVery irritating deals on food they have( Service is also v baad )They forgot after taking orderLive music is really so loud that it irritates you 
256,"OMG seemed like a good choice for some cheap drinks and food before we headed home. Unfortunately the person at the door arbitrarily refused to let us in saying it was too late. On asking what was the last entry time, turned out we were a few minutes early enough but the doorman still refused.¬†Understanding that the doorman was incompetent and unprofessional, probably how the place inside too was, we just went to one of the next door bars instead."
257,As we went around the time of halloween so the decor of the whole place was given the touch of halloween. the place had a really good ambience as they had used so many props and they had covered the windows with red paper which gave the whole place a very different feel. The place is huge and you can found really cool comfortable looking sofas all around the place and they have this huge screen on which music videos are generally playing and the best part about the place is that they have live music too. The whole place is little dark and this gives a whole party vibe to the place that you feel like grooving to the tunes playing in the background.The service of the place is really good...read more
258,"Nice place to spend time with your friends. Ambience, music, service and the most important the food is good. They also have good offers with booze. Live music add value and make your evening the best. Go ahead and try out."
259,Food was good with cooperative staff. Enjoyed the live music with less crowded place. A place for someone looking for silent atmosphere as it is less visited. 
260,Good food..Great ambience..And great service by Himanshu Chauhan..Love to visit again...................................................
261,"Great options, good food, ambiance and polite welcoming service. Prince Chaudhary served us really well, you'd realise how much the staff can add to your dining experience "

271,They don't respect guests. Very bad experience. Cross check the bill thrice. This is my last visit here. They think that PPL are drunk here so they won't understand taste but food is worst than their behaviour. 
272,A good place to spend quality time for couple...Nice ambience.. Mr prince chowdhary was very polite and friendly.. His service was great... Quality of food was also gud...Nice ambience and the best attraction was the live music...
273,"The place have been a second home. With a courteous and friendly staff like Mr. Khusal and prices that support your month end needs. Great playlist and live music is a cherry on cakeMust try- Pizza, Garlic chilli corn, Honey chilli potatoes, Pasta, tandoori veg platter (special preference to mushroom galauti)"
274,Khushal was serving the table and he was very polite. He took care of every thing and hosted us very well. The amvience was great! The live music was also great. The food quality was good too.
275,I ordered chilly paneer which was amazing. They were playing live music. And our server Khushal took care of like anything. Thouroughly enjoyed the ambience. The decor is absolutely brilliant. In the heart of cannaught place it's an amazing place to visit and sit down with your buddies to have a beer. A must visit.
276,I went there twice and really enjoyed the ambience and staff is very polite and humble. Food was very delicious ü§§ and i like there unique concepts of serving dishes.‚ù§Ô∏è #ohmygod OhMyGod

Loved the way they presented the foodüëåüëåAlso, they had a person singing live on Saturday- he sang so beautifully! Would really want to go back for the live music..And the music which they played after the live music was average! Rest all good üëç"
281,Nice ambience and service specially Khushal who was very helpful and kind. And a helped with the good options available.Must try 7 steps to hell
282,"Nice ambience, service is great, karaoke is there. Try draught beer. Peanut masala os good. Khushal the waiter is friendly. Ask him for service"
283,"It was by chance that I heard the live music happening here while I walked past the lounge. I was pretty surprisingly amazed when I entered the place. It has a  comfortable sitting space, nice decor and the interior is pretty good too. To top it up the staff is also welcoming . The food is decent. The live music was really good and that was the best thing above all."
284,"Good service, good ambience, kushal the staff helped and served us well.Good music and platter was good.. good drinks ..Enjoyed the time ..I would like to suggest it to others..Not very crowded and gives you enough of good experience.good balcony experience."
285,"Had an awesome meal and great service, with nice music make everything much more better , Had an nice evening enjoyed a lot. Food was good. Thnx to Prince Chaudhry "
286,I went to this place with one of my friend. The staff was quite welcoming and they arrange amazing live performance. The food is equally good. I would highly recommend this place.
287,"Went with my friends after looking it up on Zomato. Not worthy of a 4 star rating at all. The food is just okay-ish. There's poor lighting. On top of that, you have the intimidating staff. Not gonna try again."
288,Love the ambience. Comfortable sitting and chill place to hang out. The service and food could be better. The Ceaser salad was boring but the paneer Tikka was nice. 
289,Loved the live music arrangement. Went for a casual hangout. The food service is excellent.Ambience - 4.5Food - 5Service - 5Good place for casual dining and drinkingGood service - Kushal
290,Music is awesome along with a blossom variety of beer. French fries were also good. Ambience is  soothing. kushal served us well.....Looking forward to wishing again
291,"Good Service and Music. Kushal's service was great. More type of beers can be added, also Goa kings!! A bit more colour - dance nights or special performances! This is a great place to host such events, probably one of the best in CP. "
292,Great Ambience! Amazing service!! Good food! The songs were according to the mood and it was great sitting and spending time! Good service by Kushal! Do try their platter and burger...

295,"An amazing place to enjoy and relax with a great live music, playing all the songs which connects to your soul.Coming to the food and services, thanks to Meenu, for the instant services, lovely smile and curtious behavior. The food is yum. The beers are available. Go champ! "
296,"I guess, I was here at the right time. Halloween night üòç Ambience was pretty halloweeny that day and loved the music üòçDJ was so good üëè Plus the food was good too.Definitely you should give a try. And, if possible go on some events that'd be much better and you'll love the place more.üòä"
297,"I asked the staff to waive off the service tax, but they refused to do so as I was using zomato gold. They said its compulsory to pay service tax if we use zomato gold, but i couldn't find that rule. Please clarify this."
298,Oh my God! I wish I was that amazed after being at this place. Went here as this place was listed on Zomato Gold! The staff was cordial and the food was okay! So nothing made us do - OMG!
299,"Place is good, staff is pathetic...serving warm beer and requesting to add ice to it.Food is very average. Nothing new.Service is kind of not good...Avoid if you can. There are better places to have lunch/dinner...."
300,"Oh my god is one of the coolest party places in CP and relatively more pocket friendly. The interiors are pretty cool and the staff is also polite and helpful.What we had -1) Mixed Sauce pasta - It was tasty and quantity was great. It was on the sweeter side.2) masala fries - these were simply amazing! Must try.Many drinks of the drinks menu werent available which was kind of a bummer. Other than that, we had an amazing experience. "
301,"One of the most amazing caf√©s in CP! The ambience, service, food.. everything was just superb! Would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good time. "
302,Amazing ambience cafe which is c.p.There food and service really amazing.Love the interior Decore of that cafe.The staff was very attentive and service was great.The quantity of there food was amazing.Love everything. Must recommended to all if you are in delhi.
303,"Friendly staff. Great food. Nice drinks. Great service by Kushal. I recommend to try soy chops and chilli chicken, and pizza is a must try.."
304,Met kapil..bhai..here..at omg cafe. He try to be serious but he super fun n did took care of our deliverables..Food he suggested was good..n enough in quantity...Will definitely come back..
305,"The live music scene here is good. The service is also nice. The cocktails ordered were really watered down, dunno if it's because of Zomato Gold but this was a major turn off."
306,"This place is quite nice  as name gives you feel ""omg"". When you entered this place thats would not the word which hits youTheme was too dark we went this place in afternoon  and that time it was too dark Music was good food delicious everything  was good except the theme"
307,Great ambience. great drinks. The host Khushal was politeand kind. well served. Good experience all in all. The love music was fabulous. Food served was great as well
308,Went there for Sunday lunch. The food is alright. A limited menu though. There was live performance which set the ambience well.Chilli paneer 3/5 too saltyPizza I didn't eatBrownie with ice cream 4/5Beer we went for bira.I wanted sangria but theirs was extremely sweet . So no sangria.Also they do charge service taxAnd VATafter gst the concept of VAT is void. So I really am not sure what's happening. Deducted another star for that.The server Meena was very helpful so that's a plus.
309,"Went to this place to discover something new as we were bored of our usual places. And we weren't disappointed. The place is spacious, has a nice ambience and the service is good. The food items are also very well presented and taste good. Liquor options are pretty well spread too. Only qualm I had was the repetition of songs being played. Otherwise a nice place to hang out."
310,"Another great Cafe in CP, you can visit, they can improve thier lighting as it gets difficult to see the menu but otherwise a good ambience and good food. "
311,"I had a truly lovely experience in this restaurant . Every thing was just wonderful. Delicious flavors, beautifully presented, and exceptional customer service from all of the servers. The restaurant is beautiful and elegant. They really care about the food they put in front of each and every customer, and your experience being perfect."
312,Went there on Friday night..live music was the only good thing out there.. coming to food the starters and main course were highly disappointing and majority of mocktails were not available in the menu..they only had 1-2 options in the mocktails..and ultimately had to order them but after drinking them I felt as if I am drinking some third class mocktail...A big no to this place..
313,"Live Music + good Ambience everyone wants and specially on weekdays. Visited this place in weekdays after hectic office schedule everything was good Food, music, ambience and seating. Only issue with they have two different menus for drinks and on both of them drinks prices are different which generally not happen. They even don‚Äôt have much variety of Beer üç∫ available with them. We also ordered Wine which also not at all fresh and food. Most important thing if you have Zomato Gold than Do Not Pay For Service Tax which they ask you to pay and dat not at all written in any policy of ZOMATO. My ratings for them 3 star üí´ üåü bcoz of music , ambience and food otherwise they...read more"
314,"Visited in the old days when four people meant four Zomato Gold on a table; ended up ordering the complete classic cocktails selection. Not disappointed at all. Starters also tasted good. It was a weekend so there was live music and the place was full. The seating is comfortable, and the dim lighting and decor give the place a lounge bar feel. Surely a place you can visit. "
315,Best place to visit.. awesome live music..mast ambience hai..french fries is good..2-3 hours can spent in this cafe..love this cafe so much..special Thanks to@jaypal bhayiaü§©
316,OMG in cp is really a pleasure to visit. We ordered noodles and garlic bread. It was delicious. The walls omg are beautifully designed and painted. The live music makes it the most happening place in cp.
317,A place where you can enjoy yourselves but food is not upto the mark. After having food here we went to dominos to satisfy our tummies. Good ambiance but staff wasn't efficient enough. 
318,"The worst experience I can say.I was denied of occupying a comfortable table even when the place was all empty. And the live music was okay, but the singer is having his own attitude, so much of arrogance and ignorance to their guests.Don't even play the track, if you go to him for any requests. OMG! Seriously ?"
319,Situated at the middst of cp this place is very lively.With its live music and good food you will enjoy this place.Although it's a bit on higher side on the pocket but then once in a while it's worth it.Their veg and non veg platters are awesome.
320,Good service by Prince chaudharyFood is good and live music is awesome.Just should improve the lighting every thing was perfect. Love the place
321,One of the best places in CP that has stag entry.. it has live music and live telecast of matches.. it's one of the happening places in CP.. Prince Choudary was friendly and made sure we were served well..
322,"Oh My God turned out to be really awesome. I visited this place randomly on last weekend and just loved their ambience, service , music , food and drinks.I really like the menu as u can create your own Pizza..We ordered veg pizza with our choice of veggies. It was thin crust with lot of cheese and veggies. There was a live music. I had so much fun..Must try going..I was served very well by Prince if I correctly remember his name."
323,"Live music at this place is very soothing. The place has got enough seating area and with the cordial service, it is one of the happening places at connaught place in new delhi. The mocktails are good and so are the cocktails. The appetisers are quite tasty but a bit of improvement won't hurt anyone. Chilli Potatoes were awesome and with ginger and honey garlic toppings, it tastes even better. Onion leaves were sprinkled over the chilli potatoes. Chicken wings were a bit disappointing, too much oily but crispy. Chicken wings goes well with the mayo dip. Tequilla sunrise cocktail was decent. The dimly lit ambience was a perfect mood lifter. Overall a good place. "
324,It is a amazing place with amazing ambiance the food is also good but need little improvements I love the live music it was just amazing i was on a date there and I loved it the music made my day nice place to check in 
325,we had grt fun watching india pak match there.we and my frnd enjoyed 2+2 drinks.They had awsm cocktails.The music was bit loud for me..but it was fun.
326,Nice experience in today at omg cafe very good staff manager is so good and specially meena negi the server nice atmosphere feeling so good here come and enjoy dere
327,Damm boring.. Sorry I dont even like writing this but the place is actually quiet boring Though Food is Good.4/5 for food.4/5 for drinks.2/5 for ambience.
328,I being this place from so long. Awesome ambience and food and music. But if anyone wants to go this place and if ur server is Khushal he is best one and very helpful and awesome person. Very kind and polite. Know the hospitality and how to greet their customers. God bless to him. Lots of love to him
329,Omg is a very nice place to hang out with frnds its an awesome place music is very good. There is a guy name deepak he always serve us and he never disappointed us. Cocktails are damm good.

334,"The place has a pleasant ambience. Tasty platters. I loved the chocolate shake with Mint and coconut both. And most importantly, not that expensive."
335,"Was extremely impressed the first time one I visited with friends, less due to the menu and quality an more due to the crowd and ambience. It was a real surprise since I expected something else after hearing the name of the joint. Unfortunately, not such a good experience this time.They will never have the beers listed on the menu available. They will always be out of stock for domestic beer. How ‚Äòconvenient‚ÄôThey will never have any of  the draught beers listed available. One, sometimes.Always better to call and find out beforehand.Never ever ever go during their live music hours. The music is unbearably loud and they always hire terrible musicians who can‚Äôt even carry a tune....read more"
336,"OMG! As per it's name, this place was LITaf. I visited this place with my friends on Saturday. We were meeting like after an year. And we had the best night with that amazing food (veg. & Non veg), so creamy & cheesy. The every bite of the food was fork licking. Everything on the platter or non-platter was perfectly cooked or grilled. Going for the cocktails, the taste was yummy. Even a friend was on non-alcoholic diet, so she tried virgin mohito, and before it never tasted this better. Above everything, live music set the mood on fire.Thanku so much OMG for making our night perfect.P.s.- I am definitely gonna visit this place again."
337,I am so happy with service of prince chaudhry in omg cafe .. food was good ... service also so good.. thakk you prince chaudhry ...he was is very active in service
338,"Must try attended named Vinod Adhikari, Amazing Hospitality, Amazing gesture! Helped in a way to choose best food n drinks. Thanks man for making our dayüëç"
339,The waiters here are not that good and cooperative. But it has an amazing interior. The songs. The food. The liquor served. Everything is really good! 
340,Best place in CP to party. The music and ambience is at it's best in the National capital region. I would visit again with my friends. The food is good. Zomato gold is applicable.
341,"Best place in CP to hangout with friends and family. Best place to listen and enjoy Live music everyday around 7 pm. The crowd is very good . The staff is very friendly and co-operative and I would like to mention ""Jaipaal"" one of the best staff member I have ever meet."
342,"Went wid frnds to this place the ambience was quite nice and light soothing music take u to another world leaving Ur stressful life behind. Ordered classic chicken tikka served in handi with the smoky flavour.... taste was really good all spices were properly graved in the chicken and fresh green sauce served with it was really amazing , crispy chilli corn presentation was quite impressive as it was served in papad made bowl n even corns inside the katori were very crispy to eat and yummy and lastly ordered a Banana Hazelnut Drink and it was very nice. Overall a good place to hangout wid frnds and even u can visit wid family."
343,Decent place to visit.... Staff was good and the life music on weekend was the center of attraction.... Love my experience...... The food I ordered was tasty... And it is pocket friendly too...
344,"Went there for friend's birthday. On an all it was a nice experience.Food- we ordered Italian-pizza and pasta. It was good, both veg and non veg.¬†Value for money- An expensive place for students. Quantity of food served is less. On a scale of 5, 3 for the value.Ambience- We went on a live music day. The band was really good! Vibe was cozy, all thanks to the music.¬† Perhaps the best part of the dinner. In fact if you are looking for good music in CP the first place to recommend would be this cafe."
345,"Yesterday I went there ,food was very delicious and ambiance was great ,Sarvice staff was very polite ,I would suggest to you that you should go there for chilling ,,,,,,,,"
346,"Great ambience, quick service, superb music and good food. A great Friday evening all together.So if you like to have your couch in dark with a great music and some good, this is the place to go.We ordered garlic bread which was 3/5Nachos 3/5Singapuri noodles 4.5/5Lemon soda,Pizza 4/5Overall a great place "
347,Omg cafe totally sums up with it's name. Ambience is just wow!! They have the best layout according to me. You enjoy your food while listening to the live band simultaneously. P.S band boys were really cool and smart ;) had service been a bit faster i would have given 5 stars for sure. Keep rocking!! Chicken spring rolls is a must try. 
348,"OMG is a great place for people who like good music and a cosy ambience. The lighting is very dim but the seating is well spaced out and seats are very comfortable. We tried a few of their kebabs and the crispy veggies, and liked it. The live hindi music adds to the experience. The staff is courteous but the place was too crowded over the weekend, due to which the service was quite slow. I recommend the place if you want to chill with friends! "
349,"Addressing first things first, amazing ambience. One just can't get bored here, thanks to the amazing singer and lastly the food quality is awesome."

355,"Great place for get togather, we enjoyed alt with live music n my great thanks to Mr. Prince for his service. All the best. Great food OH My god"
356,"i had high expectations from this place after reading the reviews. but to my utter disappointment, the service provided was extremely horrible. i ordered a tandoori platter (non veg) which took about 15 minutes to get served. the mutton seekh kebab was so dry and spice-less. nevertheless, it was pleasing moderately to the tongue. next i ordered fried chicken wings. it was a grave mistake that i made, because i waited for over half an hour and the food wasn't served. i had to go upto the billing counter (since not more than 2 attendants were present in the cafe) to cancel the order and get the bill done asap. there also, the POS machine was not working, and 10 minutes of my time were...read more"
357,Trust me the live music of this place will take you out off this bad world to the god one.. the staff was bit slow but the food was amazing.. the crowd and interior was also good.. should go and enjoy the cp evening for once in you life.. 
358,A nice and relaxing place serving quality food at good price in the heart of Connaught place. you will love the variety of food and drinks they got to offer you. You will be too like Oh My God! after visiting and enjoying your time here.
359,Amazing place Bartender seems to be great guy.Amazing music and ambiance.Still not recommended to bring kids to those who broughtLoved the place. Recommend everyone to visit

361,The place is decent and very relaxing for me. I am love with the service they provided specially by the person named Prince Chaudhary. The food quality and quantity both are satisfactory. Overall i love that place. Everybody must try once.
362,"The name of cafe is totally meant it.I went here with my friends & got surprised with their ambience & service.The DJ was damn awesome, we spent 3hrs with saying OMG every single time, refer to everyone kindly visit here at once & u will come again & again."
363,"Okay! so OMG Cafe is not soo OMG ! After all , its like most places in Connaught place the ambiance is good , the food is worth the money i would say ,simply speaking ' paisaa vasool ' i visited the place last week there was a live performance taking place which was undoubtedly 'LIT'üí•The order taking process and the food were bit delayed but the staff was considerate so yeah + point for that , so over all my experience was good and fun .PS: Not a family outing kind of restraunt cause people might be drunk af and also the restraunt serves Hukka so yeah , otherwise you'll enjoy people don't judge happy dining üç∫üç∫"
364,The ambience is really nice loved the place in first go visiting again in a week bcuz of the exceptional service of staff specifically Prince Chaudhary who isvery welcoming and greeted and treated us nicely..

366,Awesome experience.. one of the best bar in Cannought place...must visit place .. brilliant sound Atmosphere and cooperative staffLove for prince bro 
367,"Amazing live and cosy ambience. Great live music. The singer was exceptional. Service was a bit delayed but the staff was courteous. Food was good too. Tried Crispy Corn, Honey Chilli Potato and Caesar Salad. Chilli Potato with seaseme salad was perfect, Crispy Corn tasted great and are served in bowl made of roasted Papad. Caesar salad was a bit let down. Value for money plus live music streaming was bonus."
368,"I have been there and enjoyed it...OMG ROCKS especially I m touched by the service given by Prince.... His name is Prince and it really suits him,he's charming sweet little boy."
369,This place seems perfect to visit with your friends and family at cannaught place delhi...I have visited there several times and found good quality of foods and customer service...
370,Unfriendly staff and service are the first thoughts that come for this place. Half of the options in the menu weren't available and the rest did not come under the purview of Zomato Gold. Highly disappointing experience. 
371,Nice place. Good Food. But options for all the beersüç∫ ain't available. Ambience is cool. Relaxing place to be with your love. Overall experience was good.
372,"I didn't like the place at all ,its expensive, food was pathetic we ordered combo and nothing was worth eating in that, they are various other good options in cp "
373,It's just amazing every time I come here. Especially Shivam Luthra and his awesome voice just makes me come here every now and then. Now when it comes to service of this place is just wow. Prince Chaudhary and jaipal are awesome people here to serve me the best at all times. The food ambiance and everything is so cool about this place and the night scene with the DJ brings more energy no matter how much you are drained out. Thank you OMG cafe for such amazing experience and sorry for the delay in putting my words here.
374,"I love this place. It has a super amazing ambience with the best staff I‚Äôve ever seen. The manager, the waiters, every single person out there is extremely helping. Coming to the food, I ordered one ‚Äò gupta ji aloo tikki burger‚Äô in starters which was served with fried and tasted amazing. If anyone of you guys are going, please do order this. I also ordered dal makhni with laccha paratha which was served in huge quantities and was super tasty. This place is actually one of the nicest places of CP. Do give it a shot! "
375,Prince choudhary took care of us very nicely....great ambience and DJ rocks....good going team OMG ! Had some drinks and wondeful food...awesome experience!!
376,This place is under rated from what it deserves. Amazing decor great hospitality. The menu is elaborate with plenty options to choose for. The food is amazing. Not to forget there head chef n the bartender Special thanks to Deepak amazing hospitality thank u Deepak . Great cocktails. The beers were perfectly chilled. Had an amazing time. The music is quite nice. The paintings on the wall are amazing. This place is good to hangout with friends.
377,Food was excellent and service by prince was fantastic Music was also good..they have large variety to order.... hukka is also fantastic....All in all must visit placeLove to come back again
378,"Not a very good place for the couples to go specially on weekends, as there is not a good crowd on weekends.Atmosphere is very cool.The DJ doesn't have a good play list. You will only enjoy if you love Punjabi Songs.The staff is good.Parking space available.Food - 3/5Atmosphere - 3/5"
379,Amazing experience..cheap beers .good place to hangout with your friends..sound of dj was good.I ordered there chilly potato + some starter both are average..so overall mine experience was good.
380,"Cheap Crowd, bad music and a lousy ambience. Better avoid this place, lots of other options in CP.The staff also seems mostly disinterested and busy in their own world.The food: we ordered a lot of food. It was all good. I particularly liked their fish starter/ whatever comes in the non veg platter service was okAmbience : This place is like a big Hall furnished with rows of sofas - the sofas are comfortable but the decor is boring.value for money"
381,"It has been my squads go to place whenever we can‚Äôt think of a better place. It‚Äôs always the same to be at OMG and never disappointing! We‚Äôve had a lot of things here and everything has been up to the mark all the time. Whether you want to go out and party or have a nice time sitting and catching up on life, it‚Äôs definitely a go to place. "
382,"Very nice place to hangout with friends! Hookah,food and drinks are good and reasonably priced. Prince was very good and took good care of my guests! "
383,"Lovely place to hang out with friends .Awesome food , lovely ambienceOrderded a veg pizza , you can have a choice of your own toppings .a big thumsupChicken tikka is soft ,succulent ,very juicyHave a pretty decent drinks menu, though we ordered pints of beer onlyUSP is the staff . Very polite ,very courteous even on weekends ( when there is big rush) .Food : 4/5Ambience :4/5Service :5/5"
384,"Yesterday nyt i went dere with friends and we enjoy a lot with live music, food and drinks.ambience was good and food were also good in taste. Nyc place for hangout."
385,Very awesome place to hang out . There is deepak who always serves us . And he is very friendly. This place is to visit for sure sitting arrangements are damm good
386,"Dis place and food was wow ... Nd d music was OMG ... Thank u OMG for such such amazing services .. services provided by Dharmendra jha was v good , v good and polite. üëç"
387,Amazing place!! The crowd and the ambience are enthralled by the live music..the place rocks..especially dharmendra!! U rock man!! Keep up the good work..
388,Thankyou omg. Best food and drinks. Dharmendra Jha was too good with us and provided best service. Best restaurant at CP. thankyou so very much.
389,"A Saturday night in Delhi and we were trying to find a decent lounge for the night. Being tourist, little did we know that most of the places didn‚Äôt allow stag. So after facing rejection at a few places we were happy that Cafe Oh My God Welcomed us gracefully. The place was almost full and we had to sit right next to the loud speaker. There was live music and the guy at the mike really kept everyone entertained. The place has good weekend vibes, and all young crowd. Food was the best part, good quantity and quality. We were super hungry but we were full in just four dishes. The only struggle was trying to read the menu in the low lighting so we had to use our mobile lights for the same....read more"
390,"OMG is a place where you‚Äôll get a dark hall with pretty loud music,or maybe it‚Äôs just on sundays(I visited it on a Sunday). Plus they will tell you they are out of beers,which is normal nowadays in any place in  CP,but here they are not just out of few popular beers,but all of them.In the end we had to settle for some ‚Äúdesperado‚Äù beer( Mexican they called it). Tasted like orange juice made of rotten oranges. Never try it!The only thing good about OMG is the terrace access, from where you can have a good peek of central garden. P.s attaching the picture of desperado.Stay away:p"
391,Reasonable and decent place to go out to.The cocktails were good and so was the pizza and garlic bread.The service is very fast and they had a friendly staff.
392,We been there on freindshipday and owsome place service was good excellent hospitality and singer shivamluthra was excellent .he rocked we never seen the singer like him . .and manager rajesh singh was humble nature person.
393,"Awesome live music, good crowd and nice ambience. However the serving staff could be more courteous. Even when the couch was available, if you're a just two people., they will force you to sit on a small table of two. I actually had to argue in order to sit on a couch as I was not comfortable sitting on chair. Drums of heaven could be more spicy and less sweet. Rest it was a nice evening and I enjoyed. "
394,"The service and ambience is nice! Their live singer Shivam Luthra, was a treat to the ears. However, their vadapav was simply bad. For someone who has lived in Mumbai for 2 years, this was a disappointment and this is one dish no one can go wrong with, ever! However the pizza was amazing. Go for the double base pizza and you got yourself the perfect deal! "
395,"For people with basic sense of good music, this is not for you. It gets tough to ignore after a while. Huge space, competitive prices, extensive menu, decent food. Just try not play the orchestra from ages ago."
396,A very grooving place and nice combination to pair up the food and drinks.This restaurant is located at inner circle of connaught place and easy to find since the parking is just next to it. Service and ambience is also quit astonishing.Food - 4/5Service - 4/5Ambience - 4/5
397,"Tried this place yesterday.. as we were not so hungry so me and my friend ordered - mango and mint, fruit punch and chilly potato.. it took them a lot of time to serve the food and even we remind them thrice to serve our order especially food though they serve the drinks at a very less time.. ambience was good little bit dark.. still like this place "
398,Oh My God.. this is Amazing Cafe..I like the most Live singing the guy who sing live he has Amazing voice.We enjoyed alot.And if m talking about food so its nice but it can be better.I dont drink too much just i got Corona.. so it was chillüòÇ i like it.And Hookah is also there that was the main things which i love the most but but but I really disappointed with hookah..üëé no good smock no good flavour and price is too expensive.Overall goodLike Ambiance is perfect Food are awesomeMusic are superb Drinks is coolHookah is Fool.
399,"I went to this place for my friends birthday.I liked the interiors and decor of this place.The staff was friendly and cooperative.I ordered spring rolls and chilly potatoes, both tasted nice.Prices are more on the heavier side, recommended for night parties. "
400,Ambience is quite goodBut there are less variety of shakesAlthough food is goodService is greatCheese fries 4*Pasta 3*Veg platter 4*Shakes 3.5*
401,"Ever since We mentioned we had zomato gold, their behaviour completely changed towards us...I never give bad ratings to a place but the overall hospitality needs a lot of work"
402,"You can easily find the place due to big poster of it. The crowd and music both were good. Although it was Saturday we get the table but later rush got increased and the restaurant filled up. I like the food taste, service and it‚Äôs interior lot. Looking forward to try more dishes "
403,I can definitely compliment the ambience. And a really good place to watch football or any sports with beer.But disappointed due to less variety of beer.And poor service. Huge disappointment of that evening.
404,A decent place to visit in CP.We went there hoping for something specific which wasn't available (for the 3rd time for my friend).We ordered chicken nuggets which we are sure were something else of a chicken dish.Not sure if we'll be visiting again though. 
405,"So, yesterday I went to Cafe OMG.We started with Chilly Potato which were quite crispy and tasted amazing.While ordering Pizza n Pasta you have to make your own choices regarding the base, sauces, toppings and seasonings. So, that can be a tough ask.Pizza was an average one. Not recommended though.Although, Pasta is amazing and so is Garlic Chowmein.We even ordered Veg Spring Rolls which I personally didn't liked much.Ambience is good. But, you will not be able to click good pictures because of the dark theme in the entire cafe.One thing, I don't like is the staff ready to kick you out if you are not ordering something every now n then. Show some patience. "
406,Visited this place with my friends on weekday n still found the cafe fully crowded! OMG! (Oh my God) awesome place to chill out Food ü•ò .. really tasty except for soya chaap which was tasting like ‚Äòjali hui‚Äô types Ambience was good with dimmed lights Music üéß was loud and sometimes you can‚Äôt resist yourself to dance Overall it was an great experience üç∫
407,Outstanding food and ambience.....the music ....sitting arrangement service everything is awesome...full kaisa vasool.And one more important thing...pocket friendly
408,"Drink and service is very good, you peep would must try this,best place for party, nightlife is also great, fantastic interior, go book your table now"
409,"Was there last evening , this was my second visit to the restaurant but was little disappointed as they didn't have Kingfisher beer which I came to know it's unavailable in entire city. One more thing while coming Up I saw a board which says 20% discount on liq but when bill came server says it's applicable on Tuesday only which is written in very small letters.Beer was exponentially high priced and was served room temperature. But no service recovery. Food I ordered was veg OMG platter which was ok but all items were fried.I had very great experience when I visited last but this time it was a mix experience.Warm regards"
410,"Awesome food , great service ,  in the heart of cp you get an Amazing dining experience. The live band was dulcet and ambience was also alluring."
411,"Food was nice but Zomato Gold was not accepted. It is a Gold partner restaurant and I expected the restaurant and Zomato to be in line, really disappointed."
412,Of all things what Oh My God has to offer I would like to say the best is its service. People working there were really helpful.We went there just for couple of beers. Staff was really informative about the menu. We ordered Nachos with Queso Sauce & Chunky Masala which was good as a starter.I would love to go there again for a full night long experience.
413,Staff needs to be know how to behave with the guests. Service charge is mandatory applicable but it is nowhere mentioned. Food was okayish. Music was too loud and who plays 'badtmeez dil' on a friday night in a resto bar.  Are u only targetting school crowd? Not recommended! 
414,Nice place . Good staff mostly beer is not available. Nachos is good but it is not home made .ambience is beautiful i like it . My friend ordered the bloodymary .nice cocktail thanks
415,Music is too loud that can destroy your evening timeout with friends.Not too much variety of drinks. The staff compells you to order specific drinks even if you dont want to do and you dont like them. Food was ok and not too special.Can give a try only once but a lot of better places in the neighborhood.
416,I came here with a group of friends and had a good time. Great food and drinks.. Good vibe overall and the staffs were quick too. Good experience overall and would recommend
417,Stuffed cheese pizza is good. But with only three toppings. Zomato gold only available on domestic drinks and these guys deliberately do not have kept the good domestic drinks. In beer you can get desperados beer. Not even budweiser or Heineken or kingfisher.  Not worth going again because of such restricted menu options.
418,Amzing place..amazin place..Amazin djy xanshaüòç vl giv 100 stars if I cud.Best place to be in cp wid frens..Worth yo time and space!!! In love wid dis placeüíù
419,"Poorest place i have every visited, food is poor. staff is rude after paying bill of ‚Çπ5000 waiter asked me to leave on the spot. Didn‚Äôt entertain my gold membership at once. My advise don‚Äôt visit the cafe. "
420,"The only reason , I'm giving 2 is because they were showing the live football match , the place was extremely under lit , the food was served cold . "
421,"Nice place to party, best part is management they take care of each and everything. I will visit this place soon. Food quality and quantity both are good. Service need little improvment rest every thing is OK. "
422,"This was the closest cafe/pub to our inn. Went without expecting anything from the place. Cafe omg is like any other small pubs you‚Äôll find in Delhi. The same old menu and bar menu. There‚Äôs nothing special about the place. DJ was playing the same old songs again and again, overall it was quite an average outing compared to other places. There‚Äôs nothing else exactly point out about the place except for the graffiti work. Food-3/5Ambience-4/5Staff-3/5Value for money-3/5Overall-3/5"
423,Under Zomato gold only IMFL drinks were covered.Place is good..nice ambience and live female singer made our day.Food is superb. This is about a Sunday eve.
424,"Visited this place on Sunday evening..overall a nice place..decent crowd,good service..good thing is the live music and the band..nd a loved the classic chicken tikkabut they are not providing full coverage on drinks for Zomato Gold..they have made their own policy for that which they should post on Zomato.."
425,Good experience with great finger food and pleasent live music sung by male vocalist.the ambience is very good and can hangout with close ones.. Jai Kohli @deepa Panchal and @monika
426,Cafe was good and food was amazing. I enjoyed a lot here with perfect lunch and my favourite drink (mojito) . Cafe ambience was quite good . We ordered so many items but my favourite was white sauce pasta with garlic bread and Pizza was quite basic .visit here #omg #food 
427,"Located in F-Block, the best part of this place was that it had live music even in afternoon! The place is usually full so you might have to wait for your seat. We had mixed sauce penne pasta, coconut chocolate cookie shake and mojito and all of them were good. The interior has low light as it's a caf√© and bar. Overall, a nice place to go with friends. "
428,"Ambience and food. üëåPerfectly suits a mid budget dine out.Music is good, won't say great.Also, go up stairs to find a sweet and minimally designed balcony/terrace üå∑"
429,"cool place, visited here on Moday eve... live music, good ambience, good staff.... food was awsm... tried Pizza and Pasta....enough sitting space, reasonable prices... "
430,Comfortable cozy place to sit back and enjoy live music. I tried mocktails and starters and all of them were really good. Plus point- The rates are not too high on pocket. 
431,"I was here last night and it's a pretty affordable place sitting in CP.¬†I liked the ambience and food was good too.Last night live performance made everyone dance so that should say something about the vibes this place had.¬†I was craving for some Bira but OMG was out of beer by 6-ish; I don't know if that happens often or was it once in a while occurrence.¬†Nevertheless, I'll recommend this place for not too loud music, food and ambience."
432,"Nice place , dim light ,nice music , cool live singer.But the waiter are quite rude.So I advice not to visit there and spoil your mood...Management need to work on hospitalityPathetic restaurant"
433,Good Ambiance but a waiter denied the Zomato gold and argued that I should have given the details prior of ordering the food/drinks however we did the same. Not happy with client dealing. 
434,Awsome Place with Delicious Food!!!Today i went to this place....and i must say totally worth it....a singer with a lovely voice....perfect ambience....and tasty food. All in all good package...we ordered veg platter...they serve it with 5 sauces and all were different flavour. My rating to this place areFood-5/5Ambience-4.5/5Music- 4.5/5Staff-4.5/5Thumbs up to this place üëçüèª
435,Been there few months back was little busy to write a feedback. Here I go. Comfortable place to sit back and had a great time with chilled towers and French fries and Nachos.. Staff was well mannered also the music was nice . Great Ambience to come up with family. Enjoyed a lot. Thank you so much. My best wishes. And now being add on we keep visiting this cafe... but I am sorry to inform that you guys are not allowing people to dance... Common man do one thing don't play music and serve drinks and ask people to dance .... Highly disappointed really want this to be looked by Mr. Handa... So that he gets to know that being the owner of Oh My God if you are unable to take care of the public...read more
436,"Craving for couple of beers after late hours work.Delhi's heart (Connaught Place)was on the timeline this time.So flewed our machines to CP in just bit more than quarter of an hour.Landed up in OMG, gave good vibes while entering, phrases in Sanskrit and their meanings was a innovative tact that gave momentum to the crave.Just here to have couple of beers for energy replenishment.Ambience- was peppy and youthful,was short and cute outlet.nice graffiti Food-didnt had many just tit bits, but that too presented nicely.Music -Dj was on his closing no.s but played ok.he closed with a punjabi no.

437,Nice Ambience. Food was good. Amazing music.Service and staff was really good.Have variety of beer to offer.Overall a good experience.Recommended for frequent visitors to CP.
438,Molten chocalte cake pastry was soemthing i tried at this place. It was just normal pastry expected much more variety of cheesecake being tagged under cheesecake category. 
439,Very good place to hang out. DJ is loud you would be able to resist yourself to dance. Honey chilly patato and Nachos were actually delicious and not expensive.We found very good crowd and all the amenities of this pub were amazing.
440,"While roaming around CP on a hot Tuesday afternoon, decided to sit somewhere and we happened to be sitting right opposite OMG. Seeing the easy on pocket menu we decided to go in. As we sat down and looked to place our order the waiter said that draught beer was not available, then we told him to get Kingfisher or Budweiser. To our dismay he said even those were not available, only Bira white was available. Since that was the only option we went ahead with a Bira white bucket of 6 and one OMG nonveg combo. I ordered a mocktail angel blush for myself.The mocktail looked good, but was too sour for my liking. In the non veg combo we were served chicken spring rolls, fried fish fingers, fried...read more"

442,This place has the best service. The staff treated me and my party really well. He was very patient with all of our questions on the drink menu. I highly recommend the bbq chicken burger.
443,"Visited this place with office colleagues. Didn't like the ambiance as it was too dark for us to even read the menu. The service was also bad as instead of virgin mojito I was served alcoholic mojito. Even the food was not upto the mark. We ordered Fried rice & Nachos which was ok but spring roll & the dessert were completely let down. Another thing which needs to be pointed is that they charged 20% VAT along with GST & Service charge, I didn't get the logic for this. "
444,"Went with my friends for some drink session in weekday. Its a decent place wd good sitting area. We had relaxed time with good music.Going forward with drinks we went for beer bucket and mocktail Angel blush basically pineapple jucie mixed with different herbs. I can recommend it,if you like pineapple."
445,"This Sunday turned out to be quite interesting. The day began with a very hot afternoon but still alive. My family decided to head to CP (been long for me as I don‚Äôt stay in Delhi anymore) but it was worth discovering. Lot many new places have opened up and it‚Äôs always good to see fresh stuff (change is good, isn‚Äôt it).**As usual, while we were revolving around CP inner circle in hunt of a good dinner spot. We bumped into a restaurant in F block called as Cafe OMG (Oh, my God). I was skeptical at first to enter but then counting at our struggling condition of nature‚Äôs call, time crunch, feet dipped in mud. Compelled us to visit this cafe. **I don‚Äôt cognize if you know this...read more"
446,"They have low intensity lights hanging from the ceiling making their interiors dark room look alike. They host live screening along with some loud music.We tried their menu cocktails Pina Colada and Sangria. Both were good. The nachos with queso sauce was pretty good.Service is okay, our waiter was good though.One point of confusion is that they charged a 20% VAT even after GST and Service Tax already applied. Not sure if its applicable elsewhere in restaurants around. This is a point that let down our evening experience here."
447,The overall experience was okay. Had 2+2 on cocktails using my Gold account and nachos. The quality of food and drinks was good. The only thing that was a let off was the bill which was generated (20 %VAT + 10 % Service Tax). Ended paying up 30 percent tax for the experience.
448,"Have tried almost everything on menu and OMG never disappoints.. go for their tandoori, starters, pizza .. pasta just everything is love! Located in CP and can boast of reasonable prices.. OMG has been my go to place since long! "
449,"OMG is big but cooling was poor on¬† a hot day and the place was mostly empty.I liked the ambience and the dim lighting but more than anything I wanted to feel comfortable.What does a man want on a hot day , A cool place with chilled beer !Waiters are attentive but not very informed when you ask them about the USP of the place .They told me that their Chilli Chicken and Mediterranean¬† platter was good .I liked the chili chicken but the Mediterranean¬† platter did not have much taste specially the hummus was very bland .The Falafel was OK but dry .They had a choice of only two beers .The saddest part was that I asked them for a beer bucket and asked them to serve one by one so...read more"
450,"Love the place! Attractive interior feel so good.Food and Drinks are available at affordable rates. Best for groups and private hangout. Only problem is with DJ, don‚Äôt play music according to mood and environment rest won‚Äôt disappoint you."
451,- Good staff.5/5- Nice ambience.- Good food.- Not too high on pocket.- Enough seating (not on weekends)This is one of the most happening property in Cannaught place however the taste of food is EXCELLENT*****
452,"It is an awesome place to be at on weekends with friends. The plus point is it is located in the middle of Connaught place. The best part of the place is its sitting option on the terrace that lets you can enjoy a sprawling view of the circle. Besides the restaurant has a big hall with dim red lights and light music, which gives a subtle charm - they might want to have some more light. The only negative bit was that sometimes the place becomes overcrowded which causes a bit of discomfort.¬†Food is decent - I wish it was better. The quantities for its price were huge though - a good thing for value buyers. They have a widespread menu consisting of Italian, Mexican, Chinese and North...read more"
453,"We went in the afternoon so may be the ambience in evening can differ but all inside we felt a dark theme being implemented which gives an average look.The music played was average too with least noise which was good. We orderer cocktails, a non veg combo and a murg malai tikka of which only tikka was the best rest were average and not bad.Last but not the least the cocktails we had did not had that strong flavor and tasted like mocktails. All in all an average bar.I would have given half a star more but that feature is not available here"
454,"Ambience - This place is like a big Hall furnished with rows of sofas - the sofas are comfortable but the decor is boring . The red tinted lighting adds a mystery but that's about it.There  is no vibe or buzz to this place !The cooling was not efficient even after switching seats I was feeling uncomfortable.Coming to the service - it was O.K.We ordered beers and they only had two local and one international beer available so we settled for what was available. But the Beer was not cold either , quite tepid and it was not helping that the place was just passably cool .Food ¬†We only had two starters - (Upon the staffs recommendation )The Chili chicken - It came promptly and hot...read more"

With classy and elegant interiors and the option of terrace seating, this caf√© gives you a complete view of Connaught Place.¬†Food: While they have a widespread menu, with dishes from Italian, Mexican and Chinese cuisines, they‚Äôve kept the heart alive with North Indian dishes as well.

456,Well! This place packs a punch. They might not be the biggest in size compared to other restaurants of this company. But it's got a good bar. Decent food and a pretty spacious dance floor. 
457,Too many bad about this place:Worst food I ever had in my entire life. Food was smelling bad and tasted stale. For a Bollywood night the DJ was playing the worst bollywood songs possible. Not even a single person got up to dance and the music was so loud that it was hurting our ears.We requested the manager to make it at least one notch lower but he simply denied.We eventually had to leave the place in the middle of our food and drinks
458,Wow! I like the music and ambience of the place. Service can be better. I did like Chicken Tikka. Overall a good place for weekend hangouts.
459,The intial concept of Heaven and Hell was something a curious traveler would love to experience. But unfortunately it wasn't implemented. So this is just like any other restaurant in CP but still my all time favorite because of its amazing SERVICE.The c/mocktails are amazing and the bartender is an expert. Do watch him make one of those. The tricks are awesome!!Food- 4.5/5Service- 5/5Ambience - 3.5/5Value for money-4/5Decor-3/5
460,"Good food, and decor. Works well for a weekend chill scene. Would have liked it more if they served the long island iced tea in taller glasses/vessels. "
461,Had the worst time here. Very incompetent staff. The place was nearly empty still i was asked to reserve a table beforehand. One specific waiter was outrageously unprofessional and rude. i was here for my friend's bday party and we were carrying a cake. we were being given cold looks which was very derogatory.. Only after the manager came out things started getting in place but it was too late. I literally had to walk out in wrath. I will not recommend this place to anyone who wants to have a good time. CP has a lot other places to offer.
462,"Very Bad Behaviour of waiters, Very Non Sense Manager, Very Abusive Owner, Very Cheap Environment, They Charge Extra than your order and then insults you."
463,"Visited this place with friends on a Saturday evening.But music was loud at the place so chit chat in a large group can be a challenge here :)We stayed for sometime there had few starters and drinks before leaving for the final dinner at some other place.Food here is average nothing with wow factor in it.we ordered corn salad, nachos with queso sauce, omg non veg combo, fish fingers.nachos was good but finish it up asap as sauce gets thick by every passing minute and nobody likes a thick cold mayo.Most of the non veg was blunt in taste.And yes they will definitely serve only limited brands of beee over the weekend which is quite common in CPoverall ratings for the placeFood:...read more"
464,"There were a lot of hindrances we faced when we visited the cafe.1).The cafe rejected to accept the deals which we purchased from nearby app. We were told that it was the caf√©'s rule to inform about the deal half an hour before and when we asked them that we would wait for half an hour , they started giving vague reasons.2) Since it was one of my friends birthday , we asked the cafe staff to play happy birthday music to which they denied that they won't play the song.3) The cafe staff was constantly misbehaving and eventually we had to leave the restaurant.This entire incident kind of spoilt the essence of birthday celebration and we had to go to some other restaurant. "
465,Food is awesome... staff is courteous... Ambience is just wowwwww... the main reason I go there again and again is the Graffiti on the wall. Always reminds me of some European street.
466,"OMG!! One of the hidden marvel in CP. Feels like a premium club restaurant. Didn't try food but Cocktails were amazing. Staff was well dressed in IPL jerseys, something new! Looking forward to have a party there! "
467,"The cafe is really nice. The food was amazing.We ordered Chicken Dimsums,White Sauce Pasta & Chilli Garlic Noodles for food. We used Zomato Gold Membership for 2+2 offer on food. And we loved it. The staff was very courteous & polite."
468,"It was our 1st visit to OMG, Ashish our server was very friendly and very attentive till we left, We really like the place and the ambience , for sure willcome back with Friends. "
469,"Cheap Crowd, bad music and a lousy ambience. Better avoid this place, lots of other options in CP.The staff also seems mostly disinterested and busy in their own world."
470,The cozy comfy place this is. Sitting - 4/5Service - 3.5/5Food - 4/5Music - 5/5I ordered non veg platter to go with beer! The service could have been better. But the tasty food compensated it all! I loved their music playlist! 
471,The ambience is okay and the food is also average. This cafe is located in the middle of the market that is a plus point but not worth the money spent.
472,This is one of the most happening property in Cannaught place however the taste of food is average. They have a wide variety of drinks with unique concepts. Non-veg starters are quite good. Service is quite slow however the ambience is good.
473,"I visited this place yesterday with my college friends.Ambience and interiors of the place were nicely done.Service was good.Not at all crowdedWe ordered their white sauce pasta, loaded cheese fries,oh my god non veg combo.Non veg combo tastes delicious. I like their fish fingers.Drinks were average.They need improvement.Food 3.5/5Service 4/5Ambience 4/5Overall a nice place to visit once."
474,"Nice place to hang out with friends, not that great ambience but located right at Connaught Place circle; so the location pulls in lots of customers for this restaurant.FOOD: The best pesto sauce pasta that I've ever had.Overall : 7/10"
475,U get good crowd over here. And mostly all the servers are polite and responsive. Weekend live music and dance floor are good to visit. Overall nice experience. 
476,"Food tasted well, food portions we're small ! Good experience overall. Chilly garlic noodle tasted heavenly, spring rolls we're good and so was the garlic cheese bread. Virgin mojito was nice,  just excessively minty. Good ambience with some good music."
477,Went with a friend for evening hangout. Decent place but too loud to have any conversation. The liquor price are like other fancy restaurants. Ordered veg baby corn and pasta with white sauce but the paste taste wasn't up to the mark. Though the service was very good. 
478,"Although we were looking for a different place in f block but after a lot of search we decided to sit here as it was easily accessible. Place was dim lit and quite empty during afternoon. We ordered veg manchow soup, cheesy nachos and honey chilly potato. Food was served on time and tasted well. I particularly liked manchow soup and other items were decent too. "
479,"Visited this place a couple of days ago. Tried a veg pizza with olives, zuchini & american corn, it was nice.Fir main course, tried the rara gosht with garlic naan, it was lovely. Service was good but the ladies washroom was very dirty.Overall it was good."
480,"went their tonight ambiance and food is well exceptional. serviced by Mr chandan . well decent person and recommended good food that paired with our drink. OMG is the first outlet of mine by Mr priyank . I enjoyed all his outlet. good food and great service delivered by Chandan. good keep it up. enjoyes your nachos,cripsy corn and mushroom and your cheese stuffed soya chaap all recommended by chandan. please guys musy visit their and ask for chandan. BRAVO"
481,"I was not at all invested to the idea of visiting a cafe that is named Oh My God. The name smacked of a desparate lack of imagination on the part of the owners.So when my friend decided upon visiting this place for some tidbit before dinner after busy day at work, I was unenthusiastic to say the least.We weren't intending on drinking and ordered dinner, thereby scrapping our earlier plan of having snacks primarily because we did not want to spend around 500 bucks on a sandwich. Dinner was good. The interior was fine, nothing spectacular and the seating arrangements were comfortable. There was live music in the form of recent hindi songs being performed by a solo artist on his guitar.I...read more"
482,"visited there with 2 friends and had there 6 Heineken, 3 Kingfisher Ultra and one non veg tandoori platter.. visited in lunch time then there was no crowd, whole cafe was empty.. had there very peaceful time with friends.. platter was also great.."
483,I went here with bunch of my closest friends so nonetheless i enjoyed the place. We ordered pasta which was really delicious and overall ambiance of the place was soothing and perfect for date.üòç
484,"An amazing club/restaurant. The food: we ordered a lot of food. It was all good. I particularly liked their fish starter/ whatever comes in the non veg platter The ambience: Beautiful place. Big in size, we‚Äôll lit with good music. Smoking isn‚Äôt allowing indoors so I‚Äôm glad. It also has a nice mid sized dance floor. The price: the alcohol is pretty averagely priced as compared to Delhi bars. I had an amazing time here. And I hope you guys can go make some memories in this place "
485,"Had been there only once along with my gf, and my 3 other male friends. It was a sudden plan as we were just roaming in Connaught Place and was not able to decide where to head to.I was expecting crowd to be there but unfortunately all of the tables were vacant except one couple. Ordered Ice-Tea, Pizza, Fried Rice and Chilli Paneer. Drinks were good, Pizza was thinking crust so it was yummy.DJ guy was rude, the other couple who was there made some request to the DJ guy and he just ignored them.Service was little slow but it was ok as we were busy in our conversations."
486,This is the worst cafe . Worst service . Worst music . Worst food . Visit this cafe only if you are ready to get your mood spoiled . Not worth money . Not even a good crowd . Dont try chinese food here . 
487,Place is a total bummer. We went for their molecular gastronomy cocktails... THEY DONT SERVE it anymore.. update your stupid menu guys....Waiter constantly messing up my order... Asked him for sangreas but he got margaritas instead.. asked him for two liit but he gets six. The pita platter was just ok.... Manager was a complete douche.. really bad vibes here...would definitely avoid at all costs.. waste of time and money...HORRIBLE
488,Good food. Went there for a birthday and enjoyed the ambiance too. Best were the snacks. We ordered veg platter which was good.¬† Overall good place to enjoy and unwind.
489,Was there just after interview had fun with friendsAmazing place When i enterd live music chl ra tha feeling amazing thi üòáüòçüòé In short nice  place to hang out with friends
490,"Awesome place to hang out, had a great time here, food was good and so was the staff. Swift service and supportive staff. One of my favourite places. Will be visiting again soon. Keep it up‚úåüèª"

492,Best place to chillout and have some booozzz in cpBeautifull ambience lovely service and mouth watering food they offer one of d best packages in vicinty in terms of drinks foodSpecial mention to mr shera who helped us to decide our foodKudos to team omg
493,"The food was good undoubtedly. But service Pathetic. When i clarified on charging coke above MRP (INR 95) the waiter tells me....""Jo Karna Hai Kar lo"". So you can imagine.Music so loud that you may end up being deaf....and I am not exaggerating it is loud enough to make you deafI begged if not 2 times then atleast 5 times to reduce the volume but all in vain. They ended up increasing the volume to an extent that even shouting in someones ears was not helping. ."
494,"Recently visited the place they have changed there theme, Better then earlier more of casual dining look instead of fine dine. We had ordered for stuffed crust pizza that was good and shakes were delicious. Dharmendra was polite and helpful. Good work keep it up. "
495,"I m here with my friends once again...kinda loved the place,everything was g8 but onething always forced me to come over here and feel like in OMG..really rocks,D.jha and Mr.jaipal was really out of the world...OMG rocks and the manager over there named Mr.B.S.Rawat was great..like to visit again n again"
496,PLEASE DO NOT ATTEND THIS PLACE. STAFF IS UNEDUCATED AND INCLINED ON THIEVERY.                                                            .                                                                         .                              Worst people.  Thieves. Someone stole my jacket and wallet. I made them review their CCTV cams. We saw someone taking my things. All they said was...‚Äôit‚Äôs just a jacket and some cash sir. Forget it. ‚ÄòDO YOU REALLY WANT TO BE AT SUCH A PLACE? 
497,"Hi there, Whoever plans to visit them with a girl with them, please don‚Äôt ever do that. They just ruin the experience for a group. Worst ever management and worst ever support staff. Their managers think as if they can get away with anything. Arrogant managers, especially in terms of dealing with issues when you are there with a girl. They are demean the whole issue for you. Please spare yourself and avoid this place."
498,"The worst place in terms of educated staff. I am not talking about literate staff, they are simply not educated enough to help you for small things. The managers there are arrogant and the support staff draw their bad manners from them. Please take it from a girl, don‚Äôt go there ever if you think you want to get drunk and relax. Please don‚Äôt. From a girl to a girl!!"
499,"I tried their loaded fries accompanied by mayo & salsa. The loaded fries were actually loaded with cheese, all the cheese lovers can definitely try it out. I also tried their street side veg noodles. It was extremely yum and worth it.Courteous staff, good food, good ambience and good music. Would definitely recommend this place. The place is pocket friendly as well. And you can prefer going here for comparatively inexpensive drinks and good food.üí•"
500,"Excellent place with good music, food and service.I would like to mention a special note for resident DJ Xanshaüòä, who played awesome music, he has excellent collection of punjabi, hip hop and EDM. Hope to see you soon.üòòüòòCheers!Charuüòç"
501,"Visited this place with a friend.Started with bacardi & beer, also ordered for a veg pizza with olives, zuchini, american corn with extra cheese.The pizza was yum.For the main course, we hadRara Gosht with garlic naan(one of my favourite), and it was amazing.Ambience was nice, love the service, forget the name of the server, the only negative thing was the washroom, please take extra care of the washroom cleaning guys.Overall it was good."
502,Dharmendra jha . On a very special note . This person deserve the special applause. The way he treat us you feel like very special. He is very polite clam and having smile on his face always.

507,Amazing place with great cuisine and aesthetic. Loved the food and place. Tandoori platter was awesome and the paav bhabhi was so delicious. Great location and courteous staff. 
508,"Been there with my friends.. Great service,ambience n friendly staff especially chintu pandey, he made us time lively, the way he handled the guest n makes them more comfortable was phenomenal, I recommend him to get a promotion "
509,Been there last week excellent place to hang out. Ease of ordering the food and the temperature of the food is appreciatable. Freindliness of the staff is highly satisfied. Highly satisfied with taste of the food . Overall it's been a great experience spending some time there. Excellent service by Krishna Verma.
510, The place is brilliant and the food amazing. Friendly staff and I would like to recommend the services of Kushal. I never felt left out and he attended me to every detail. Would come back definitely.Thanks Kushal! 
511,"I have visited there last week and this place is worth visiting again. Dj was good it was less crowded. It does have good ambiance, good infrastructure, good service and one of the most important thing is food and food is really good in both quantity and quality( specially drums of heaven)."
512,A shady place. The DJ was terribly bad and unfriendly.  The music system speakers were  so loud that  it felt like they are  bursting in your eard.Quite unorganised. Food is average.
513,"Nice place with good ambiance and amazing DJWent there on 25th December.¬†First we took a table in the lounge area and later moved to terrace. Both were really good.So here's my style of review:Food: 4/5Music: 4/5Ambiance: 5/5Service: 3/5 (No one asked us for water, and we had to wait a long to get a waiter around our table to order. Will try some other day as it was Christmas, So I am giving benefit of doubt to them)And yes, it can be visited again."
514,"Food: Well, after you are being absolutely clear about what you want on your pizza and still it comes out something different, you get little disappointed. I think they should perfect their order taking skills.Drinks: Don't try Cosmopolitan, ladies. Too Orangish and almost bitter.Music: Loud and with those beats you can dance even on Kailash Kher. So, if you want to have an intimate evening, visit it as you would be sitting too close and whispering.. oops... Sorry shouting in each other's ears.Ambience: I have no idea how but even with those dim lights and that loud music, I had a smile throughout my experience. Good for group of friends. Decor is millennial still it is worth going...read more"
515,So nice music of this place nice ambience great food . awesome night out at cp also u like country fried wings i recommend to all please visit...the place
516,"I had been here yesterday , the best thing about this place is it's ambience and courteous staff. If you want to spent quality time with your loved one , you will definitely enjoy this place.Food is not that great and okay in taste only and prices are as per the other outlets available in Cp but I would seriously recommend to atleast check out this place ."
517,Its was awsome evening at omg cafe.great food  great ambience .also good mocktail .beetle nut madira and angel blush  too good all music and enviroment .frendly staff kanha . And D jha 
518,"Half of the drinks and food listed is not available. Order 12 person together, which is served in plastic beaker, and the beaker has all the marks and strain, when we told that to manager he said that happens with plastic utensils.Order a veg platter which was very average. Loud music with no sense. A still place not just to avoid, but surely miss "
519,"Had a really bad experience here. Went to omg cafe on 25th dec with 2 friends. Ordered Chilly potato, nachos, and mix sauce pasta. In drinks we had coconut and cookie shake and one virgin Mojito. Apart from the chilly potato, nothing was good. Couldn‚Äôt even finish the food, it tasted so bad. Also the nachos, were coming straight from the packet, and they charged us ‚Çπ355 for a ‚Çπ30 nacho packet, apparently. Also, they refused to accept dineout reservation, despite the confirmation. The staff was pathetic, the seating area was ugly, we chose to sit at the rooftop, and it was filled with insects and mosquitoes, with torn sofa cushions. Won‚Äôt suggest it to anyone. "
520,This is one of the worst places i have been to. Service is so poor that we waited for almost 45 mins to order and nothing happened so we moved  out. There were only 2 more customers apart from us. Manager didnt even bother to ask reason when we were leaving.
521,The best thing about this club is crowd and the way they treat there customer. The food is very very delecious and the quantity was also good. It was  Worth it ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
522,"After reading all the reviews about different cafes landed here. On a scale of 10, ambience can be rewarded 8 for the rooftop only and the ground floor can be rewarded 5 as the place was filled with smoke and was crowded. I ordered Burger, white sauce pasta, hakka noodles and pizza. Must try only includes hakka noodlesThe service was good and we didn't wait for long to get our order on our table."
523,The place came as a surprise and it actually made me say.. O my god.. such a happening place. Since it was bollywood dj night.. a fusion of old & new songs made it more happening. Food was great. Mushroom galouti is worth a try. 
524,"AmbienceWe were looking for a place in Connaught circle, we ended up here. We asked for roof top, they send us to some stairs which were lost and ended up to a junk room and we found more stairs to go up from there. We were thinking like where are we going. When we reached roof floor it looks like a setup b/w dhabha and restaurant.ServiceWe got a place and after some time they started playing loud music, we were not able to talk.¬†¬†We requested them to atleast reduce the volume or switch of the one next to our table. He simply denied it that volume we can't control and switching off is not possible at all. When one table said the same thing, they switch off one speaker. This was like...read more"
525,"Celebrated my birthday there on 12th December and it was just amazing experience. Food- 10/10Ambience- 10/10We ordered Hummus pita falafel platter, Veg kababs platter, Chicken Tandoori, Chicken spring roll, chilli garlic noodles, cosmopolitan drink, sangria, sex on the beach & bucket of beers. Each and everything was soooo delicious that everyone is so impressed. Staff is super nice. There was live music going on and I must say it was just superb. Everything was perfect for my birthday. Thanks for the beautiful night!! "
526,I celebrated my 25th birthday in november at OMG and it was splendid!! It was during the week and barely crowded so it made for a perfect private gathering without shutting down the place. The staff was nice and i liked the walls they were pretty unique. OMG i had fun!
527,We ordered white sauce pasta and paneer tikka naan pizza. It was really yuck in taste and it was not hot. The food was not at all good. It was horrible. And even the service was disappointing.
528,Visited yesterday with friends to celebrate Saturday night. Thought to have a visit to this place.When we entered at around 8 pm.... Light music was being played. Wasn't too crowded. Felt lights were little dull and not properly arranged.Food was yum.... Do try drums of heaven (non veg).. and also hakka noddles !We Had 12 x 30 mls of old monk and bacardi white rum ! Rum is necessarily important in Winters üòãService was good .... They were on a rush on a less crowded day....Price is reasonable and is easily affordable.All in all a nice visit.
529,"Horrible experience, half of the menu was not available.. no heniken, no Breezer, no fresh juice and no cold coffee.. equally bad service as well, staff had absolutely no issues when we told them we will leave as nothing is available. Ambience was also average, very shady stairs to go to the rooftop.. "
530,"Food : 3/5What we ordered:Food-Chilli garlic noodles - found them to be sweet and undercooked. Mixed Sauce penne Pasta- okayish with less salt.Peanuts masala- tastyDrinks- Choco cookie shake without mint - quite tasty with decent quantity; reminded us of good old school days.Service : 1.5/5 quite disappointed. Huge scope of improvement.- they did not offer us water on their own. We had to ask for it.- they were not keen on serving the food.

Mr Krishna because of him we stay there for couple of hours... 5/5 to Krishna...Management - please look into the taste and make some USP dish if you don't have...Cheers..."
532,"The fact that this place located in the Inner Circle of Connaught Place in a prime spot was halt empty on a weekend evening speaks a lot. Half of the brands and cocktails in their drinks menu were not available. In food, we ordered Veg Platter of starters and a similar Non Veg Combo Platter of starters. The Veg food was not upto the mark and the non veg, although better than the veg was strictly average at best. Ambience was not great. Even the live music was not great. Price was decent, not too expensive.Overall, this place is definitely missable."
533,So today we were actually looking for some place just to hangout . We randomly went in here . Let me just say the terrace here is worth all the money . I mean on a winter chilly night this was great place to be .  Coming to food we ordered jaloti chicken drumsticks and malai seekh kebabs. Kebabs were really nice . Drumsticks were okay . Hookah took too much time to get prepared but was average . 
534,Nice place food delicious dj music.... Aahh ok ok... Staff is good service fast...but Saturday night khali tha saara akele hi dinner karke aana pada. ..üòÇ 
535,"I had attended a party at omg cafe a few days back . So the entire place had been booked . The place is quite spacious and could accommodate a large number of people . The ambience was very nice with bulbs hanging from the ceiling , sketches on the wooden pillars , the view from this cafe is also amazing , one can see the entire inner circle and the waving flag at the center of it all. The pizza was okay . The honey chilly potato was very tasty . The chilli paneer was also quite tasty . The virgin Mojito was quite refreshing . Overall we had a great experience at omg cafe ! Do try ."
536,Nice place for parties nd hang out. We ordered veg. fried rice which was not at all good as was expected from the place. Custom pizza was good and tastier.  Its cost is average with approx 1300 rs. For two person including drinks. 
537,Good food and ambiance. But most importantly awesome DJ. It is a nice place to hangout with friends if you are in a party mood ...............
538,"This was my first time at OMG. Good food in reasonable price, many promotions. Ambience was nice to get relax. I think band also entertain you if you step late evening."
539,"My patent place. I have lost the count as to how many times i have been here. Mr rawat who is the manager is a gem of a person. He takes smallest detail into account. Best is Chicken tikka , dal makhni, speghetti chicken and the list goes on and on and on."
540,"OMG !! They have terrace serving. What else would you like during the sweet winter. We decided to visit this place as we wanted to chill out in the heart of Delhi - CAnnaught place, eat in open area. The unit is on second floor, without any lift - so burn calories and increase your hunger. Second floor is a lounge styled area, all covered with comfy sofas. You have to move another two floors to reach out to terrace. And wallah, here we were.  On roof top they can accommodate approx 20+ people on four - five tables. Saw few guys having their hookah, and other things. We were comfortable on roof top, time for the review Ambience : very good inside, on roof, good but loud music for...read more"
541,Pasta was amazing ordered veg platter superb itwas . Dahi ke kabad and panneer tikka was very well Mocktail was okay. Pizza was big and tasty..
542,Amazing food.served properly. Service was fast and serving is good. 5/5 for food 4.5/5 for ambience 5/5 for service 5/5 for servings I‚Äôm looking forward to visit again Sapna Saini 
543,Oh my god . As the names suggest this cafe was really omg . No doubt ambience is good bt when it comes to food it was nt upto the mark . We ordered tandoori platter and it was pathetic . Plus the dj person was extremely rude . We were there to celebrate my mom's bday nd they totally spoiled it neither the food was good nor the songs . I would suggest try some other cafe coz its nt worth . 
544,"Went there on 27th October as my cousin was performing live. The food is ok, ambience is good, service is good and gentry is also ok.Not light on pocket when you compare it to pocket friendly joints in CP.If they work on food quality place can be much better. "
545,Had good experience..specially the dj...satbir singh was jst mind blowing...will visit again for sure..cheers satbir...krep it up..ur a rockstar...
546,"it was my friend's birthday and we decided to give this place a try. the food is decent and yummy , the interiors are nicely done . the staff is quick and efficient."
547,"Ambience was amazing.  Kudos to the DJ who made it better. Loved the music over there. Food also did not disappoint. Services were exceptionally well. Plus, place is not conjusted."
548,"Recently I went to this cafe for my birthday party celebration, they served us well and gave the best deals from there side. It is a good party place. The best part is the Sufi songs which starts around 7 pm or 8 pm and the DJ which starts around 11 pm. The food is amazing. I liked almost everything that I ordered. They served delicious brownies in the end. The main course was good but after having starters people didn‚Äôt eat main course much. The infrastructure was satisfactory that‚Äôs the only reason why I marked it to 4.5. Or else other things were on point even hookah was nice. üéÄ"
549,Went there recently. Its an undestated pub and lounge in CP. The good part...the food and drinks are reasonably priced for a property in CP. It wont burn a hole in your pocket. The rooftop has a serene setting. The most important. ....the staff is courteous and attends to you politely and timely.The bad part...the dj...i have no comprehension who hired him. The pub management needs to hire a person with a better sense of music.
550,"Was there on Sunday evening.. Good music not that crowded and Ofcourse decent food.. Decently pricedWe ordered starters like a Tandoori platter Veg with crispy chilli corn & potato wedges... Good taste followed by Pasta which was really nice. Main course included Paneer lababdar, chicken dish and laccha paratha which was again nice Drinks included LIT and two different soup.. which I feel the quantity was a little less. Overall a good place to hangout for a nice evening.. Staff is nice and polite"
551,"The staff seems inexperienced, didn‚Äôt feel even a genuine bit of warmth as a customer. Prices are too expensive.Food quality is okayish.Not recommended."
552,I don't know if I went on a off night but nothing was up to the mark. The service didn't suck because there were hardly any people there. But the DJ was a total flop and food-wise it was okay. Nothing to make me go wow over. Ambience is the only saving grace but that I can get in many places across CP.
553,"I have been here couple of times and the only thing which makes me visit this place again and again is the amazing DJ and food. DJ Satbir is one of the best DJ in town, I have been following him since last 4 years. A wonderful jolly DJ with some serious collections you can find. I love his Sufi and country collections.OMG is one good package to be in, eat drink and dance with all your heart out.DJ Satbir does make you grove and I can bet you won't be able to hold yourself from tapping toes on the floor.Kudos to DJ Satbir and team OMG.See you soon !"
554,For a party worth 30k they refuse to serve a beer 10 minutes after ‚Äúbar closing‚Äù. Thanks bartender Arun. You lost annual business worth 150k from my company. Good job.
555,The food is great here. The beat part is DJ who plays nice songs and has good behaviour too. I asked him for a specific song which i thought wouldn't be available. Surprisingly he had that song and that made my evening. Will visit again soon.
556,"I've been there for my friend's birthday party and its was lovely experience there. Enjoyed all lot had great fun with awesome music and food. staff was so polite and well behaved as it should be.Especial thanks to the ""DJ SABBY"", thank you so much man for all my request you made my night. great collection, great choice. And the manager over there MR. Sher Singh gave us a good deal. we will visit agin for sure. ¬†MUST RECOMMENDED.AMBIENCE 4/5FOOD 4.5/5MUSIC 5/5"
557,Dj has very bad sense of music....some college going kid will play better music than him....also they don't play Bollywood dance numbers during weekdays....sincere advice...Change ur f***ing Dj!
558,Late review we were went on Saturday Bollywood night with the group of 4 people around 7:30pm... There were no more beer options but starter we odered it was mouth watering good taste with good presentation.... Now comes to the music point DJ start with the mixture of Bollywood Hollywood & Sufi which was foot tapping overall is good experience 
559,"Ambience was very nice. Music was ok but yes not that good. I really like the hospitality, staff was very cooperative. Food was also nice. Masala cottage cheese burger is a must try. Will definitely visit again. All in all , a nice experience."
560,Really liked the decor and ambience of the place.To much surprise the place was not crowded.The food and drinks was decent too.They have a DJ and music can be not of your taste.

562,"I will come on to the food later..Because the dj and his music was so pathetic that I had to sing ""Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fu*^*ng DJ¬†!!"" üòÇüòÇFrom Bollywood's hero flute to kyun ajkal neend kam khwab jyada hai"" he played everything in between..No offence if it was on request but if not then....LIIT was our only saviour..Veg tikka platter is not a thing to add to your drinks..galouti was tasteless..So was soya tikka..Hoping for a better experience next time.."
563,"A place in Delhi which created a lot of hype when it opened but last week when we went here it was totally empty, though the interiors are good , staff is humble , sweet and quick too. I really liked their white sauce pasta and pizza . Drinks were not good . All in all it was a good experience "
564,Chintu Panday is great nice food and ambiance service was nice everything is good veg platter condity perfect non veg food osm panday was helpful 
565,Our office team party was organized here. We were around 25 people. Live music was really good n must mention they took really nice photographs of our üòÄ capturing the evening. Food was i think average. Thin crust pizza was delicious though. Good option for party and get togethers.
566,"Caf√© OMG is situated at the Inner Circle of the CP . Visited this place at 10PM. Saw the 70% of the crowd on the Dance floor near the DJ console , it was the very good positive vibe on the Navrata Days . The DJ was playing awesome music . Found most of the couple group dancing on the floor  . Initially he played the New English Popular  Tracks , and latter he played Hollywood  and Punjabi Tracks .

567,Nice place to be with your friends and hangout. Good stuff people. Pocket friendly. Great customer service. Had loads of fun with my gang...:)
568,Very bad and rude service by the staffsüëé.. only good part was the live music.. but the staffs were so irritating that we couldn't enjoy the musicüëé
569,PATHETIC IS THE LEAST I CAN SAY ABOUT THIS PLACE. Let me start with the ambience which is dark and dingy. There are hardly any lights. Music is LOUD ANS UNBEARABLE. We ordered Schezwan noodles and the place didn't have the Schezwan sauce. THAT IS RIDICULOUS IN FIRST PLACE. I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY ARE DOING BUSINESS. I WONT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL.THE PLACE IS SO DIRTY. THE TABLE WHERE WE WERE SITTING SOMEBODY PUKED THERE AND THE FLOOR WASNT CLEANED. THIS PLACE IS AN ABSOLUTE NO FOR ME.@Zin.shweta
570,"Visited here for lunch today.The ambiance is really nice and the place has a good vibe. The staff is very courteous and polite.Ordered for pizza, pasta and cheese loaded fries.. everything was delicious and the make your own pasta and pizza concept is great with a variety of toppings and crusts.Loved the place."
571,"Have been to this place last night. Experience was not that gud. Food quality was gud but the service was very slow moreover, band was so-so. And most of all pathetic AC, we were all sweating. "
572,It was not a great experience and the DJ was too rude.. food was 3.5 service was 4.5. We were in a group of 25 and still we need to convince the manager for the song. Really disappointed.Hope it will improve.
573,Had been to this place months back with friends on recommendation when i was in Delhi. This place is located in the heart of New Delhi. The food was good and loved their mocktails. The service was quick as well. Over all it was a good experience.Food : 3.5/5Location : 3.5/5Service : 4/5Ambience : 3.5/5
574,Totally amazing interior. The theme is really nice and food is good too. The hookah is a bit costly but then its worth it. I went there in the morning so there was no crowd and the services were pretty fast.

577,"Visited Oh My God last week during the night and this place is full packed. Really nice crowd and good music. The food and drinks here is nice! Must try their Sheesha. In food do try their customisable pizzas, chicken tikka and burgers! "

We. enjoyed listening to beautiful voices there and the girl sang really well .Talking about the food , we had a kaali daal ..omg i cannot explain how awesome it was ‚ù§Ô∏èThe staff is friendly and takes care of very small happenings.I would love to be there again üëåüèª"
579,"It was my 3rd visit to this weird place and first after so called modification to restaurant, but my experience remains the same... Pathetic..The only thing which is commendable is staff who is always available to serve you with a smile. Food was really cold and chewy... "
580,"Its a cool n cozy place, nice interior, food was great, service was courteous .we realy enjoyed the night with their sufi night...good place to hangout."
581,"Went to this place because we were in F block and it was nearby and we just had to escape this heat! The staff is welcoming, seating is extremely comfortable and food is also tasty! We ordered chicken spring rolls, penne arrabbiata veggie pasta and 3 cocktails. All of it was perfectly made.Paid around 2k for all of it (which is slightly expensive but considering how such places are in Delhi NCR, it was reasonable). The allow you to make your own pasta/pizza and have a lot of options to choose from.Also, they do not levy any service charge. Would love to visit again! Lovely place.

Booking experience was also cool by talking to Rawat Ji who was very polite in the call.We went there on time and started the party on time. The person who was allotted to us was Krishna and he was toooo good in all aspects like personality, politeness, smiling face and very helpful.Rawat ji also met us with such a warm welcome.

593,Good place  food is also good but the best part is missing this time n that was live band on tarrace  bit disappointed with your beer option rest thing r good
594,"Been visited Yesterday, Service & Ambiance was good. Only concern is with Bill, They Put VAT & Service Charges as well apart from GST. Will scan and put their bill on TAX Department of India to understand the meaning of ""One Nation One Tax"""
595,"One of the best Daal Makhanis Nd Shaahi Panners ever, period. Hop in to Cafe OMG to witness some of the best live bands, sheeshas and food. Warm Hospitality is an add-on too ;)"
596,"Good food , great location and good service! Me and my friend visited on a Saturday afternoon and by the time we left in the evening this place was full. This was my second visit. Good place and amazing drinks. Chicken spring roll is a must try! "
597,"Visited OMG cafe with a fairly large group on a weekend. First impression; I could hear a live band playing while climbing up the stairs for a couple of floors. As soon as you enter into OMG cafe, the ambience doesn't look that great as it looks like a dark place with small n stylish yellow light bulbs glowing around. But it grows on you and your eyes adjust to the lighting as you spend more time inside. The pictures will present the visuals better than words so see it for yourself.  While the live band and their choice of songs was quite nice especially if someone enjoys soft rock & sufi but the volume was a bit high to our liking as it was difficult to make conversations. After the...read more"
598,"Well the name really resonates with the kind of restaurant it is, but In absolute pathetic ways! Think of a nice evening u want to spend at happening place with good food, drink and services- And NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE. The food was such Oily that u can grab some and apply on ur breads if u want and whatsever is left u imagine what u wanna do...The dish Bombay Wada Pao gives u a flavor of dried Kari Patta and u think better i should have gone to some nice south indian restaurant instead. Went there with high hopes and thinking about nice evening, ended up having Daal-rice (believe me...i have the bill). A Big No for a place like Cannaught Place where there is no dearth of good places."
599,Awesome! Dancers u rock! It was a fun evening. Food is a little expensive but it great for special occasions. Keep up the good work and keep progressing 
600,"Well CP offers lots of joints and Cafe's to hang out that u'll never be out of options. Located above Chaahyos the interiors of the cafe are to die for.. really spacious and good seating.¬†This bar has limited number of drinks available, although some branded are available. The food was really good and so was the portion size! This Cafe is one of the affordable options in CP and can make a great place to hang out with friends during the night as well as day. The staff is also nice and the service is quick.Service : 4/5Cost : 3/5Ambience: 3.5/5Overall : 3/5"
601,"Located in F block, Inner Circle, Connaught Place, The OMG Cafe has always been a primary choice for many people. I have been a regular to the Cafe over weekends but recently it was my first visit to the place on a Saturday late evening with friends. Although, they provide number of options in both food and drinks but they were running out of most of the specific beer and vodka brands. I don‚Äôt know whether this is done purposely to force customer to buy expensive booze or what.¬†If you like dark ambience it will be okay. I didn't like it though as I felt nauseous about the ambience and too loud music (we couldn‚Äôt even talk). May be it's being too picky. But you want food in a...read more"
602,A good place in Connaught Place to hang out and enjoy. It is spacious with a nice ambience and offering delicious food. A perfect place to go with a large group of friends.
603,"OMG what a shit place to drink, they have no choice in beers or wines, super dissapointed. The air conditioner isn't working properly. The food is decent though. "
604,"Spaced out Seating with the guys running out of specific beer brands more than often.With the kind of area available, they could have done so much more with the ambiance.Snacks were just about average barring a dish or two, the Chicken Biryani in the end was completely malnourished.Service was excellent though.My Personal RatingAmbiance : 2 / 5Food : 2 / 5Service : 4 / 5"
605,"Nothing about this place got me ""oh my god"". The ambience is huge but not well decorated. The furniture and all other interior stuff seems off according to their name. It looked cartoonish. For me the place looked different in picture and in real. I don't know why, maybe the lighting. Yes, they need to improve the lighting as it was dark.The food was average. The hazelnut banana shake I had was not good. But the service and staff are apt so this rating is for that only. :)Otherwise, I didn't find anything to go gaga about this place."
606,"This place had been on my bucket list for quite some time now. Finally got to visit for an on the go snack time. Since it was day time the place was quiet with less people, hence can't really comment on the ambiance. But I liked the decor. We tried Oriental style Tofu and Bell Pepper with chilli sauce. The tofu was very soft and the chilli sauce had a perfect blend of all spices. Really liked the dish. Definitely coming back to try other items and spend some more time here.. ;) "
607,"It's rare that on a Saturday evening one finds decent a place in CP that is not overcrowded. That's what I could find out about #OMG yesterday. We decided to go to #OMG as all the nice ones had a waiting time of at least 30 mins. As friends ordered liquor, I was quite surprised that non of the pocket friendly brands were available which be it beer or hard liquor this was a turn off. May be OMG was trying to avg out the the daily cost for low crowd by serving expensive international brands. We ordered veg and non veg platters everything was fine except the hara-bhara kababs. They just tasted shit.... However what made the evening was the DJ couple of rounds on the floor did makeup for...read more"

609,"Superb service!!! Reasonable rates(the final bill pleasantly surprised us:)), good ambience, good food, good music, good hookah..what more does one want! :D"
610,I went this place with my sister around 8pm and the moment I entered this place it made me uncomfortable.lights ambience everything was giving such negative vibes.only the food is lil fine otherwise its a bad option to visit this place
611,"If you are searching best hukka in cp ,then oh my god  will be the best place in cp . Ambience is quite good as compare to others. Love their terrace area since it's situated at heart of cp and you will love the view of  indian flag ."
612,"The service, servings, ambience, music all were worth every single penny you spend here. The manager is humble and very courteous. I don't know the name of the server who server us, but he was undoubtedly the best. We ordered spaghetti pasta(veg), chicken tri platter, garlic breads and brownie with ice cream. The dessert was super amazing.Highly recommended !!"
613,Been to this place with friends. The ambience is just okay like any other random cafe. Music was way too loud that one couldn't even talk properly. We had to shout. Food wasnt good too. Ordered tandoori veg platter which was just okay. Hazelnut banana shake was like homemade banana shake.
614,"The first thing which put me off was the interiors. This place is undergoing renovation, which is fine and it is no incovinience. But the people taking the bookings should inform the guests about the same. We were famished and tired so decided to give them a try. We ordered two dishes, veg quesadillas and fried rice with a chicken gravy. The food was surprisingly good. Both the dishes were decently done. The service was good too. I am cutting stars because of their carelessness. Guests should be informed in advace if such changes. "
615,"I tried this outlet yesterday with one of my friend we ordered Chilli Paneer, Chilli Chicken in starters trust me it was really good in taste as well as in quantity. In maincourse we ordered Butter Chicken And Dal Makhani with laccha parantha all were good in taste. Try this place if you want to spend good times with good food."

617,"Ambience is pretty good here. It's situated right above chaayos so it's easy to locate as well.I am pleased that their crispy corn didn't disappoint me and actually tasted good, and their chilli potato had sweet as well as chilli's taste.Their thin crust pizza was not upto the mark even with their best pizza base, cheese and toppings.Their fresh lime soda had a different taste with perfect sweet and sour combination making it different from other places.Would recommend to try this once atleast."
618,"Thanks to one of the online deals which actually pushed me to go there.But at the first instance, it appeared to me as a normal cafe, but the point which stole the credit was the service.¬†The service was prompt, ambiance is nice, during the evening they play music, DJ veer comes in the evening but if there are any special DJ coming then they only come by 9 Pm or something.Overall the place is nice, good to go as a couple or with friends, you can seek online / offline discounts with the manager as well.It is very near to the Puma store."
619,I was amazed with the wide spread menu choice Not only for me but my parents too they being vegetarians always get a hard time with variety They are also equipped with a proper dance floor So it's not only the table clutter to enjoy to Being situated in CP makes it even more reachable Keep up the good work guys

621,"Went on a friday night around 8PM.It was decently full when we went. And was almost full during the peak time.The ambiance and interiors are okay...With dull lighting and looks like a rather old restro bar sorts.We ordered veg platter....which had 4tandoori snacks. Soya chaap was the best in all.Corn and mushroom salt and pepper only had corn and less if mushroom.Fully loaded nachos were crisp and good.Music was little loud...So if you planning to and have a convo, that's not gonna happen. But if you wanna enjoy music...Then its fine."
622,"went here with my brother for some drinks and quick bites, its was vacant other than a group of 7-8 people, then also staff was thinking before offering us a table we were given a table after around 10mins, menu came after another 5-8 mins, then no attendants again for next 20-25 mins, ni attendant to take the order, eventually we left the place without having anything.one word to describe this place pathetic, too loud music, pathetic service. NEVER VISITING THIS PATHETIC PLACE AGAIN"
623,"A place to calm down and enjoy drinks , food and company. The staff is well mannered and takes good care of you. The ambience is well suited for a subtle taste and the terrace is pompous enough to attract your evenings. The sound tracks are never boring here and it's never too noisy inside to distract a pretty conversation with your friends or partner. Food is good and the prices overall doesnt burn ones pocket. I have been here so many times that it's hard to suggest any specific menu l, we have tried almost everything and more or less the taste and quantity have a thumbs-upüëç from me ."

We spotted this Cafe while hanging around the inner circle and intrigued by the name thought of giving it a go! And I am glad that we did. Located above Chaahyos the interiors of the cafe are to die for.. really spacious and good seating. We ordered the white sauce pasta, some nachos and honey chilli potatoes. The food was really good and so was the portion size! This Cafe is one of the affordable options in CP and can make a great place to hang out with friends during the night as well as day. The staff is also nice and the service is quick.Overall a must checkout if around CP. "
634,I had a bad experience in this cafe. They are kinda fraud. They have added extra quantity in our bill and even after n number of arguments they didn't agreed to it. Such big cafe doing such cheap thing and I would not say it was by mistake. I would suggest people to keep on reminding the count to the service guy if you have plan to stay longer and make sure you put all your order to the same service guy.
635,This is my first time at OMG with frnz and experience was awesome..Had penne chx pasta and cheese stuffed pizza..both were delicious and again awesome üòúService was also good..Dharmender were our server special thanks to him to give us such a Gud service...Cheers
636,Omg is a good place to visit with your friends for celebrations or any get together. You will experience good service by the staff. They are very gentle and polite. You will be served nicely. The crowd is good. The ambience is amazing. The music is awesome. The seats are comfortable and you will surely like the sitting arrangements.
637,"To be honest I did not go with much high expectations,as myself being a non drinker and non smoker,the picture I had in my head was of Hukkah smoke all around and dim lights with strong smell of alcohol all over,But the place was just the opposite. Very nice ambience,great seating space and nice comfortable couches. The food was good,was served hot n fresh. The noodles had just the right amount of spices with not so overwhelming Chinese flavours,and Honey chilli potatoes were crispy and tasty. Pizzas were delicious,nicely cooked and evenly spread cheese.Must try- White sauce pasta, Veg garlic noodles, Honey Chilli Potato, Fruit PunchSuggestions- Must have some more choices for Mocktails...read more"
638,"Huge place with very very comfortable seating! They DEFINITELY need to wor k on the lighting, its too dark inside , without exaggeration you can hardly see the person sitting next to you. Liked the music, soft and ¬†easy-breezy! Liked the drinks that we ordered . Had a chicken classic tikka which is served in a clay pot , which was tasty but i think pretty OVER-PRICED , they may need to work on that, if you order two serving of starters that comes to more than what you pay for the drinks(!!). I liked the decor of the place, washrooms, very clean and staff very polite and helpful . Food ,kindda over priced . Overall a nice place.All the best guys!"
639,"I went here on last Saturday, the ambience is very cool. I ordered chicken tikka with beers and it was very delicious, the presentation of chicken tikka was very nice it comes in mini tandoor. After that we ordered pizza and butter chicken which was also mouth watering.The service was also very nice. The DJ was played very good music the way he played with good skills and mixing , he convinced me to dance. Hey DJ thanx for making our night memorable. Surely visit again here soon."
640,Sorry for the late review . I was there few days back . Bartender made a personalized cocktail it was amazing . Food was good . Ambience was okayish . Over all a wonderful experience . Thank u so much . 
641,Omg is the best cafe in CP. Its better if you come here and look for the best waiter his name is DEEPAK. You will definitely feel good.I will definitely come here again itsy third time. Omg you are good as best and your waiter specially Deepak is best server.
642,Been a while #DelhiCafe OMG nice place good ambience good food the music is a bit dull however keeping the price and food quality in mind it's good. chicken spring roll are amazing must try
643,"can assure the quality and variety of beers is pretty awesome there, and the interior is also very arousing :P if we leave aside the service the this is perfect place for beer"
644,"Came here last month on recommendation with few friends.. the decor was nice.. very efficient and prompt service.. we took the fixed menu liked their cocktails.. the snacks were good too.. specially the chicken satay, pizzas and paneer tikkas. The main course was delectable too.. quantity just right. Both Indian and oriental. Love the brownies in dessert. Will surely recommend to friends and family. And would like to visit again."
645,"Cafe OMG is located in the heart of New Delhi,CP. We ordered Honey chilli potato and Chilli Cottage Cheese and I will have to say that I was really really satisfied with both of them,they were quite delicious and quantity was respectable.But,the shakes and mocktails disappointed me alot as the only thing I wanted from them was refund for it. The service is really quick though and staff is pretty friendly. They need to work on their interior lighting as the place is to shaddy.Visit once for the delicious food and quick service!3.5/5"
646,"On recommendation I went to this cafe with my colleagues. Interiors wasn't impressive. Loud music which was more distracting. I ordered a veg tandoori platter, Daiquiri (cocktail), pan beetle(mocktail). Drinks were awesome but the platter was tasteless. The name of the cafe doesn't match to anything. Felt like more of a local bar. Staff was polite but still clueless of the menu."
647,"Came here last week with few friends and wasn't disappointed at all. The dishes were tasty and the cocktails were creative as well, well balanced flavours and just right portions when it comes to food. The service was good as well. I will be back for sure."
648,"The place is prety simple, but i like the view from the terrace to the central park. You can enjoy the food and drinks. Nothing high finto expect. Ordered Non veg platter, served in a haldi which was very innovtive. And the taste was yum. For drinks dint tried the cocktails or mocktails. Went for staraight drinks... so all in all worth for once a visit!"
649,"Oh my god is a heaven set up, where the interiors are pretty elegant as well as interesting. One can not just ignore the elephants up on its ceiling or the comfortable gold Sofa's. Coming to food, I had half half customizes Pizza's they were all really nice, even the drinks were quite good, I didn't like mushroom ki tikka much also service can be improved. Everything else was bang on! The rates are fine, if you compare it with other restaurants in this area."
650,Nice place with nice interior. Place wasn't lighten up as it was daytime. Food was delicious and shakes too. Place worth a visit however it would be a good idea to go there in evening. 
651,A group of us went last week and had a wonderful time.  The music was incredible and the food was delicious.  Everything tasted homemade.  This is definitely the place to come when you are looking to spend some good time with your friends and colleagues.
652,"If you want to try something else than usual cafe's,you can visit this place. The ambience is good and many parties are held over here.Overall a nice place"
653,Been here to celebrate birthday with family. It was a very bad decision.This place is not for family who wishes to spend quality time. Food is good. Ambience is good. DJ is noisy.. Too much noisy.Message to DJ: you are pain in the a__s.
654,"Visited here for the first time with my friend as heard praised with colleague...we entered,the area was less crowded..terrace section was closed so we sit inside.Space was huge but it need maintainence. We ordered cheese garlic bread which was good; soya tikka best part with crunchiness n softness served with mint chutney n onion- best part i loved it; n potato wedges which was average..service was quick  n in mannered way..wish to visit again specially for seeing terrace space n soya tikkaüòã"
655,"Perfect Ambience, Nice people, excellent food. The bbq chicken Burger was fantastic and the chicken tikks pizzawas also very good.Worth going"
656,"Today visited Oh My God for the first time along with my friends. A perfect place to enjoy at the terrace in the evening. A very spacious place with seating arrangement at the terrace as well with comfortable seating and dim lights is what one needs in this weather. I just loved this place. Not just the ambience but the food is equally remarkable. To start with tasting the delicious food, we ordered Penne alfredo with onion, capsicum and mushroom; Crispy chilli potato with honey and sesame; Nachos with queso sauce and chunky masala; Cheese stuffed  cream cheese pizza with baby corn, onion and capsicum. All the items were really yummy. I found pasta to be the best out of these. In...read more"
657,"OMG is a heven themed cafe, with quite huge. The elephants on the roof are quite attractive, I had a soya dish here which was good, also tried there half and half pizza its a good concept and taste wise also they are really good. The sheesha's are huge and the service is slow."
658,"Had Paneer Shashlik and Betel Nut Madira here. Loved that they served paneer shaslik in a earthenware in the shape of mini tandoor. Betel nut Madira is a paan base drink.Thumbs up for the view from terrace, food and the fact that they do not bill service charge."
659,"Being the center of New Delhi, Connaught Place is graced with all sorts of brands from different sectors. Whether it's bookstores, digital showrooms, movie theaters, clothing brands, or famous restaurants, you can find anything and everything in CP. Known to the fact, Oh My God is also trying its luck in this commercial location. Spaced in three floors, OMG has a dining area with dance floor and two terraces facing the majestic view of CP.The drinks menu here has limited cocktails, out of which Seasonal Fruits Margarita, and Whisky Sour were my picks. Seasonal Fruits Margarita was palatable. Paan Flavored Hookah was easy and smooth.Appetizers sampled included Mushroom Galouti, melting...read more"
660,"The good is average (in chinese its below average), ambience is good - the best part was live music by less known singer. But he was able to make us seat through our terrible food.¬†Service is really nice servers take good care of you - only issue is food. We ordered Singapore noodle which had a achari taste to it, chicken and fried rice all felt like roadside bad chinese. Hope this place improves its food coz i would revisit for ambience, service and music again."
661,"The place is average in its decor as I do not find anything new in the decor. It is like any other caf√® in Cp. I was unable to find any relevance in the name of the caf√®. Although the food is good as well as the beverages. I ordered a virgin mojito and angel blush, both the mocktails were nice. As farcas food is concerned I odered a pizza, chilly garlic noodles, red sauce pasta and potato wedges. The best thing about the food is that they let you choose your favourite toppings for pizza and pasta. Also the staff is very polite and caring and tries to help in all the possible ways. In terms of food it is a ""full paisa vasool.""Keep up the good work :)"
662,"Oh my god! A flawless place with decor related to Roman Empire leaders. In such bustling places in cp, I've found my comfort place with dim lighting and amazingly great music. You should definitely give this place a try if you are looking forward to dine in a place with appetising food and soothing drinks. Hookah is so phenomenal here, had two flavours cloud 9 and blueberry which were simply amazing. So calming.Drinks: ANGEL BLUSH- A highly recommended mocktail if you are teetotaller and love mix pineapple flavours alot. BETEL NUT MADIRA- Wonderful presentation and even better taste. Say hello to your new favourite drink all paan flavours.TEQUILA SUNRISE- Lovely combination of...read more"

664,Amazing place with live unplugged music.affordable drink's food & good service .It's Monday nite full jam packed terrace. Omg cafe is amongst good cafe in Connaught place.
665,"So I have visited this restaurant today.The food was averageDrinks : ice tea (peach), banana and hazelnut (mocktail) must tryCosmopolitan cocktail : big noVeg platter 'sucks'Pizza(hand tossed) with garlic bread is a must tryDessert : cheese cake was OKCheese fries: must try"
666,I visited this place with my friends ..N the ambience was ..Very very amazing .... .. service was good . Also I had dinner there ..N the food was delicious . But they really need to modify the drink named angel blush ..It was almost like maaza n lemon . DJ was my fav part ..I danced a lot.I was disappointed with their dinnerware ..It was not up to mark .
667,"Visited the place on Saturday Night with someone. There are three levels of this place. First one, which is indoors has great ambiance and a good DJ. Second and Third Levels are with rooftop seating and Ghazal Music.We sat inside and enjoyed the music.Ambience was great .Service was good.Food was very good. Beer at very low prices.Overall, Good place to visit sometimes.NO SERVICE CHARGE : Something very relevant these days. "
668,"Oh My God OMG is an infamous establishment by Big fish Ventures. Located in F block in CP, omg serves some of the best food combined with great ambience and terrace area.

669,"Oh My God is located in F Block, Connaught Place. The name itself was enticing enough so me and my friends were compelled to try it. This place specializes in some great Asian and North Indian, Chinese and Italian cuisine. The Ambience was compelling. OMG was spread across 3 floors of seating including 2 floors of outdoor seating. The interiors were amazing.We had ordered a lot of starters which were amazing.Must try their Mutton Shami Kebabs and Fish Tikka.‚Ä¢ Pizza - I had also ordered a pizza where you could choose your own base from Classic Hand tossed, Whole wheat, Naan & cheese Stuffed.

670,"MUST TRY: Make Your Own Pizza!!When in CP, it is always hard to decide where to go and dine. There are just so many options, you always feel your head spin in a tizzy with the plethora of restaurants you have to choose from. Cafe OMG is one such decent restaurant that gets lost in the crowd at times. This place is a sure shot recommended from my side for their Pizzas and Non-Veg items.Their speciality has to be the option of making your own Pizzas. I have tried this before in Ahmedabad as well and trust me, it generally turns out to be amazing! They have a lot of options in bases as well and the toppings are cool too. As I am refraining from having alcoholic drinks this year, I only...read more"
671,"When God said don't take my name for no reason, I think God made a good point. But the people at Oh My God really have a good reason to use it. Firstly, only God can help them. Imagine a 1980s style Chinese eatery. Now, move all the old furniture and fish tank or aquarium, if you may, to one side. Keep the curtains. They are now vintage. Arrange the freshest graduate from DJ school of Bollywood and get the most visually unappealing lighting. Build a giant bar which serves only IMFL. Then, sit back, relax and prepare to watch me leave. Good luck, Oh My God: Oh my God, me. "
672,Went to this place twice with my friends. They have an amazing outdoor sitting with attractive ambience  Their service needs to be improved a bit and they got to work on their pizza menu though the drnks including mocktails are great served.The musical evening they organised on Christmas was fabulous 
673,"There non-veg is not HALAL, plus they serve pork there ............. so it's simply a No No for me & all people of faith......... üò±üò±ü§îü§îü§î"
674,Looks and appearance of the place is high and the it almost looks like a heavenly place .Great place to hangout woth friends and have a get together . Food is also delicious the drinks are well made and are really tasty . The items that are made in food are a own masterpiece in its way . 
675,The place dint get upto the expectation.. drinks asked were not available.. n this happened thrice.. dint like the ambience as well. Lighting was really dull and was stinking and was untidy as well. 
676,Located in inner circle this place is not so difficult to find. I visited this place recently with my friends and the moment we entered the place I was quite pleased with the decor and ambiance. The Red theme with golden interiors adds to the environment. The non veg starters were really good especially chicken fingers. The ambiance is not so happening as the other cafes but it's quite peaceful yet happening. There is live music which is soothing and joyful. The service was quite good and and staff were friendly and it's not so heavy on your pocket.Final verdict- A place worth visiting!!
677,"Oh My God is centrally located, ambience is OK, food is fine. Staff is happy to serve. Not a very happening or anything worth boosting about."
678,"Visited today with friends. Pretty good ambience with good music. Nice place to hangout, friendly staffs. Mostly get 2+1 on beers at good price. Must try chocolate mouse desert with butter scotch. "
679,"Ambience is pretty good.Friendly staff.Food much better than other lounges in CP, especially the tandoori naan chicken pizza, it was amazing. Also had the chocolate mousse dessert with butter scotch ice cream. One of the best I ever had. It literally melted in my mouth.Tad bit pricy compared to other places but definitely worth it."
680,"Recently visited this caf√© , my experience was not so good as I didn't find its ambience good as well as the sitting was also not comfortable , music was not so good , only the food was fine not that much good according to the taste I found the price was not worth , overall experience was mixed and rating is 2.5 and that is because of its food ."
681,Chilled out place .. amazing interior decor ... Names of the dishes were extraordinary.. food was tasty but need to have more vegetarian items ..
682,Awesome Panner tikka...nice environment....cool place to have nice drink after work....roof top is amazing..has a quite place for people who won't like loud music.
683,"Ambience was great . When it comes to FOOD it just AWESOME , we had ordered pasta and pizza it was just  mouthwatering . got my order in lesser time and served beautifully . "
684,"Hi guys,The interior of this place is really good located in central delhi cannaught place. The place is large with ample seating space. The service is good with one attender per table. About the food, the pasta is marvellous. So creamy and tasty with a lot of vegetables. And also baked nachos.Have a good day foodies..!!! "
685,"Food- Between good n average ‚ù§Ô∏èAmbience - positive & nice ;) Quality & quantity- Quality was good ,¬†Overall experience- 3.5/5Will i visit this place again ?- YesFollow me on instagram - dapperscuff"
686,Really nice place... Indoor ambience is okay but terrace seating is great!! Food is too good.. veg and non veg both. Must try - triple chicken skewers! Staff is prompt and courteous
687,Went there for a family get to gether and love this place ambience is quite nice and terrace s usp. Snacks were served hot and taste delicious but dinner was served cold. A must try thing is their one of the drink which pan beetle madira which is such a refreshing drink that one really need to try it
688,"Its easy to approach place if you are near rajiv chownk metro station. Interior, lights and the furniture of the place is so sexy that i love to visit the place most of the times.Service was bit slow but the food i ordered was good."
689,I so loved that place üòä ambience waas so good.. food was too tasty.. nd it was not costly at all...drinks were good... fulll paisa vasool üòä

691,A huge disappointment!This cafe has great interiors but the food was totally not up to the mark. We ordered spring rolls and paneer shaslik tiranga. For drinks we ordered 3 budweisers. Presentation was okayish but I didn't like the food at all. I wouldn't recommend this cafe to anyone. The staff was not at all welcoming.
692,"Located in the heart of delhi.¬†As I stepped into the place Iliked the ¬† interiors,lights,wood decor,panorama, and a beautiful heart shape chair.we place the order for food & food was very delicious.I loved the food served by them.Drinks were also very tastyService was little bit slow.¬†must try place for foodie"
693,"'Oh My God' is a multi-cuisine restaurant situated in CP. Being our first time, we were dicey about getting in there for lunch, but couldn't be more happy about our decision later on.The interiors are unique and beautiful, the place is divided into two parts- Heaven and Hell. It provides a luxurious dining experience with that perfect someone. We couldn't help ourseleves adoring the decor.To satisfy our hungerpangs, we went forth with:‚Ä¢ Tandoori Chicken Naan Pizza- We have had naan pizzas before but this one was out of the world, the base was crispy loaded with right amount of cheese and chicken. This is a must try for all the people who plan to visit here.‚Ä¢ Jamaican Jerk Chicken...read more"
694,"Visited the place last week because i have seen the wonderful omg reviews of the same. Undoubtedly the place has beautiful interior but that cannot be the main thing when you visit a cafe / restaurant.  The place is big with a warm environment. I didnt like the food much . Some or the other thing wae definitely missing in each dishes . Also, its a bit overpriced as per the food."
695,Ambience- Great music (4/5)Food- Average. (2.5/5)Tried pasta (both white and red); grilled chicken and Hummus with Pita. Service- Decent (4/5)Attentive and courteous staff.
696,"So the concept of the place is nice. And honestly, that's where it ends. The interiors are spacious but the decoration is super weird. It's just there, you know? You don't squeal with surprise and you don't scream in shock. It's just, There. When my friends and I went there, there was a huge group of Kitty Party ladies in the restaurant. The waiters seem to be extremely busy for a place that big with no crowd at all. But, that's just the way it is. The food. I wish I remembered the name of the dishes. But, one question - Why? The music - Zombie on Loop. You decide."
697,Great place to have fun. Awesome ambience and service. Food is good. Music is best. Good option for a small get togather or party...........
698,"Oh My God is a lounge situated in heart of Delhi. Has two separate themes Heaven and Hell. Loved the interiors. I was with my friends and we ordered our drinks and to complement them we ordered Chicken Phyllo Spring Rolls, Tandoori Chicken Naan Pizza, Classic Chicken Seekh Kabab and Bowl of Chilli with Crisps. Service was good, food was fine too, pizza and spring roll could have been better. Overall 4.5/5 experience."
699,Went here for lunch with my friends.The ambiance of the place is good with nice music and seating. We ordered -1. Honey chilli potatoes - They were crisp and tasty.2. Margarita pizza - The pizza was not very good. The flavour was okayish.3. Chicken Tikka Burger - The burger was tasty.For drinks we had ordered lemon ice tea which had a very unusual taste and was okayish. Overall the food is average.

I had Nachos with Veg toppings, Veg Quisedilas and cold coffee rating is enough to explain my experience. Food : 2/5       Taste- Average        Quality - Good       Quantity - Good Service : 2.5/5 Music : 1.5 /5 ( really 'Badtameez dil' for a dance number? )In short, In any situation if you don't have any other option then visit this place otherwise there are better places in cannaught place.

702,Hi omg cafe team...please share the pictures of 15th October evening pics..on ur fb page.. excellent experience.. amazing foodAmazing staff....Oh My God 
703,"Omg reallllly good cafe with separate themes for heaven and hell great food and ambience . A good overall experience , the waiters and other staff was also quite hospitable."
704,"Had visited this place a fee months ago for a party. They had good deals back that time. All in all,  a decent place to chill.  The food isn't AMAZING amazing. Just decent enough to fill your stomach."
705,"After a long wait i finally visited this place. Strangely on a friday night this place was empty.Hardly few tables were occupied. I dint like the music at all. But the food was good.We ordered vada pao with lasuni chutney, soya chaap and paneer tikka. In moctails we ordered angels blush. Paneer tikka and vada pao were worth tasting. I dint like their sheesha."
706,A very okish place during the day time... V ordered only red sauce pasta...which was definitely very good...the ambience and music was also just fine!!
707,Beautiful place and awesome interior and delicious food .. Perfect place to enjoy ur day with ur partner ... Would love to visit here again and again 
708,"Wonderful place... Nice ambience, nice staff, not too loud music, good food, not crowded as well. Perfect place for a nice, quiet, peaceful dinner. On the negative side, they didn't have any pork dishes(although they were in the menu) which I was very excited to try out, and the restaurant was a little bit too dark... But overall a wonderful experience, I'll definitely go back again... "
709,"Oh My God!! Similar reactions when i visited this place, I couldn't understand the ambience of the place, It looked like a movie set or something.The food was nice but the whole Ambience tajes the charm away. Had their Chicken Tikka with Skewers, served in a big earthen pot and Nalli Gosht served with chutney in those tiny cookers. Both were nicely presented and were full of flavors. Must try if you happen to visit OMG!!"
710,"I have been to omg cafe. They had good options for vegeterian and non vegeterian.dishes i tried were falafal disc, triple chicken skewer,tenderloin bacon burger and thin crust pizza.food was amazing in taste and presentation.thumbs up to omg!!"
711,"What a great place to be at. Completely loved the ambience, music, everything was just perfect! Would love to visit again. Loved the service and the food"
712,Actually tis place is much focused on to their Bar.But food is good to....As I don't drink but this place has still got good options on their menu.Shami kebabs were great and were quite different than the regular ones.Follow us on instagram @foodvood.
713,"Checked in here with family, and had a good time chit chatting. Ambience was quite shady and music was appropriate to complete your chit chats. Ordered drinks, pizza, kabab and tikka. Drinks, Kabab and Tikka were amazing, pizza was a disaster however.¬†Smoked Cheese Stuffed Shammi Kabab:Served with cheese papad, sauce and onions, tikka was extremely soft. Melted like cheese in mouth, tasted amazing.¬†Classic Chicken Tikka and Dhaniya Pudina Pearls:Served in a matki with 2 barbeque sticks, the chicken kabab were amazing.

714,"While scouting for restaurants at CP, I came across OMG and instantly thought it was a cafe but it turned out to be a super fancy restaurant and exuberantly expensive place. Now while the decor and ambience is good, the food is very very expensive, paid about Rs.500 for a salad which is an atrocious amount of money instead decided to leave and went to House of Commons.According to me this place isnt worth the money, so will not recommend.   "
715,"A perfect place to hangout with your friends. As the name suggests, the ambience is totally worth it. Even in the afternoon OMG has the most happening crowd. The food was good but not that great. I ordered malai tikka which was the best, a Sriracha chilli chicken which was good And Tandoori chicken naan pizza was average.They even serve sheesha and the mocktails were fine.So basically 5/5 to the ambience and crowd. 4.5/5 to service and 4/5 to food. "
716,"Decent place to try out once atleast, Good offers if you will download BIGFISH App. Food is also good but not extraordinary/delectable.Zomato I believe u guys should also suggest us some sort of benefits to your top reviewers/consumers who are dining in a lot of times and posting reviews.. I know that you have an offer for those who are ordering food via Zomato but I'm specifically talking about  dining offers!!"
717,"Order: 1. Kachhi ambi chicken tikka2. Bucket of 6+2 KF beer pints (you get certain offers only if u have predownloaded the Bigfish app)The only reason i couldnt give a higher rating was because we basically dint eat much, fpocussed more on the liquor offers.But the tikka was well made with this attractive presentation.It is a good, comfortable not overly fancy but a go to place with friends.Reason for recommendation:1. Very affordable liquor with offers2. Good seating arrangement3. On the move service of the staff"
718,"Located in F-Block inner circle of Connaught Place, Oh My Good is one of the most over rated place that you can find in CP. From its decor to their food to their service..everything is over rated about this place.Musts: nothingRefrain from: refrain from even visiting itFood:taste: below averagequality: goodQuantity: averagePresentation: can be betterAmbience: over the topHygiene: goodService: slowStaff: need to learn some basic mannersLocation: goodCost: 1800 for two..not worth it"

723,Oh My God looks fancy but is really isn't. Ambience is ordinary and is the food. Service is quick. The spring rolls were just ok - nothing so great. The drinks were great and the Adams Apple is recommended for sure.
724,Nice place in Connaught place to visit with freand an celebrate the party food was good cocktel and mocktel vvvvv good plz go and visit the place 
725,This is situated in the F-block of the CP market. They really must have spend lots of time on their interiors. This is bar-cum restaurant so the ambience is pretty good. But ready to shell out more for the meals here if you really want to enjoy this place.
726,I would advise to stay away from Oh My God! They have aptly named the place because that's how you feel about your decision for going there. The food was average. Happened to go on a¬† Friday and they had a live music performance; the band kept sound checking for an hour!! I dont think I am ever going back.
727,"About this place to start with the Service is very bad, even after sitting for 15min they didn't even served water,food quantity was good but not the taste, dull ambience, music not so good, no warm welcome, i just enjoyed the beer at the end with soft centerd chocolate desert out of the 5-6 items i ordered to add galauti kabab was still ok to eat. "
728,"If you need a less happening place,  with less crowd. Hop in to this cafe.  The interiors is fine and the music is also soothing as well.  Not a good place for party Animals.  For a decent date with least disturbance it's a place to be considered. Food is upto the mark. "
729,"The interior are not so good, chairs condition are not good and seating is not comfortable at all. Food was average, only pasta and desserts were good. Menu is not having much option. Music was pathetic."
730,Nice and absoulutly good place for sitting with friends to drink and eat ur lovely drinks and the food is also served hot as they can do service is also good keep it up guy's love this place.........
731,"Omg cafe is an outlet with Really cool decor. Due to lack of time we just had a quick beer there .The staff is Really friendly and skilled . Amazing roof top . ambience,music,food and sheesha it makes this place a number of times."
732,"Omg the place to be in Connaught place on weekends ! Absolutely rocking music,good food,interest in drinks and very thoughtfully done interiors.the best part is service . Awesome place ....        I highly recommend this place..."
733,"Oh my god, I thought if the place would make me scream that, but its an average kind of place, with dark lounge ambience, food is good, music was too loud but DJ was rocking. AC was bone chilling at the place where I was seated. Card Machine did not worked. Overall an average experience."
734,"The interiors and ambience of this place are quite good.They had a live music performance yesterday. The food is though pathetic. I tried paneer tikka, vada pav, veg fajita, mushroom galouti, potato wedges. Everything except paneer tikka was poor. They should look into the food quality they are serving. Potato wedges weren't peeled properly, how can you expect this leniency in a lounge.Skip this place"
735,"Oh my god as the name says is was shocking Oh my god!! Ambience was awful seemed liked we have come in an indian desi wedding!! Pathetic lighting, pathetic food, pathethic service!! Not at all value for money!! Please u require improvmnt!! "
736,Serive was a very poor and staff are behaviour roudly of everyone. ¬†And their senior waiter is in ego and behave of roudly I'll request you to never anyone came in this restaurant
737,"It was saturday evening and we thought to have some drinks to hangout. We were not supposed to spend much as we spend a lot on drinks. So we found OMG. We generally check for bar menu and specially beer. So we check in OMG and found good ambiance, loud and cool music, as it was 6 PM so we decided to sit inside to chill out. Beer prices ok but apart from beer other food items seems to be costly or we were not in the mood to spend more üòú. Although We liked OMG but will love it more if they can add some snacks.  "
738,"So I went again to this cafe today and they have dropped down their standards I don't know why. There was no smoke in sheesha, had to change it in every 5 mins. Last time when I went here they had the best sheesha in town. NOT NOW. Food is okay - pizza was great , pasta had no sauce it was dry.Overall it was a disappointment.  "
739,"Oh my god! Yet another happening place in CP. If you are looking for some lip smacking food and delicious cocktails, this is the restaurant you may choose. Located in the inner circle, this joint offers great music and service. The best part of our time spent there was surely sheesha. Just loved it"
740,Very nice placeGood ambiencePaneer tirangaa is a must to tryPizza with thin crust and nachos were goodMusic should start as early as possible
741,"OMG!!!! I believed and trusted so much on the zomato reviews... With lot of expectations I came here and with double disappointment i left this place. There are better places in cp than this one.,Ambience : Beautifully designed.. Fairytale / heaven theme, animated fairy pictures on the wall, cupid paintings, heart shade chairs, feathers by the wall... Perfect set up. Food : I had naan chicken pizza, sun dried tomatoes soya chaap, garlic chicken, chilli paneer. Out of all soya chaap worth ordering. I have never tasted such chaaps and for the first time i felt veg was better than non veg. All 3 stars for food only. Service : Poor and boring. Very slow staff and dull by face.Drinks:...read more"
742,"Ambience is Nice(nothing much diff. Than rest of the bars in C.P) Food was fine, but what i didnt like the most here was the service, Staff is like very untrained  here!"
743,"Located in the heart of Delhi, CP this is another good place to enjoy with your friends. We had their special Chicken Tikka , loved it's presentation and we ordered a pizza, I love those places where you can make your own pizza from choosing the pizza base, to choosing type of cheese and a variety of toppings. Pretty interiors and comfortable seating , courteous staff"

As soon as you enter the place, and get the first look, you will feel as if you have entered a film city set of a heaven shoot."
745,"Cafe OMG! is yet another happening place in central Delhi. A good place to hangout with friends, party and enjoy drinks. The cocktails were very good, however the food didn't impress me much.¬†So they have come up with a new way of making cocktails in an inflated sugar ball. I tried Adams apple and tangerine, and both tasted pretty good.¬†Mango & Mint shake, a very unusual combination for my taste buds, but I am glad I tried it.

752,I personally do not understand the reason for such high ratings to this place. Starting from food to service i found it below standard. The staff was rude. It did not matter to them if the customers were kept waiting. I will not recommend this place to anyone. If around CP try any other cafe but this one.¬†Sorry for being candid but it disappointed me more.
753,"Great ambience, good food and friendly staff. Perfect place for weekend getaways. A refreshing concept of heaven and hell which would make you want to come for more. "
754,"The lamb dish was cold & unnecessarily soggy. My friend and I were served Cheeseburgers, instead of Teriyaki Chicken burgers which we ordered."
755,"Visited omg, as this place featured in newly opened and thought lets venture here..but was disappointed.Seating was congested..interiors nothing great.Music non peppy..food so so.Drinks ok.Overall not 2nd visit worthy at all .Nothing OMG about it."

757,"OMG focuses on seasonal ingredients, lots of vegetables and a reasonably priced attack of small plates. They continue to impress on the ""restaurant inside a home good store"" tip. The precise attention to detail of each and every design element makes these OMG restaurant an interior design freak's wet dream. They have my girlfriend completely hooked. I'm not sure what she likes more, the food or all the little knick-knacks on the table. From mini flower arrangements to neon salt shakers to the dishware she'd buy out from under her pastry if it was for sale. Oh wait, it is. Genius.

762,"We had gone to enjoy my birthday in April 2016. We ordered red pasta, Veg pizza and some saut√©d vegatables. I would rate OMG 4/10 in terms of food served. Service was poor and staff was not so cooperative. Ambience is good and I liked the music."

765,"I visited this place at 5 pm and we were 8 people and we had to struggle to get the AC but due to some power cut we had the worst time but as and when time passed all of us started liking the place since the presentation of food is amazing here and one should try as many things as possible not just for the taste but it's presentation,the ambience is good but somehow the God and devil theme does not sync but a good place to hang out,chat and date"
766,There are so many cafes coming up in Connaught Place yet with such stiff competition omg cafe served us a cold pizza. The food was brought to us after waiting for an hour. Sadly we had to eat that hard crusted cold pizza because the waiter had forgotten about my complaint and I was awfully hungry. The dj really needs to play some good music and not some loud jarring house music.Thank u omg for an OMG experience.

We ordered the regular chicken tikka , virgin mojito , Bharwa aloo.. Pan paradise hookah was exceptional.. The DJ is great , Bollywood songs start after 11pm at night.. Go on till 1am.. "
780,I dont know what's the point here.. Theres golden and red and sm old wooden furniture.. There are butterflies hanging heart shapes chair backs.. Nothing blends together! Though it's not suffocating like warehouse cafe. Staff should be way more polished and trained.

I could sit on them forever.To drink I ordered the Italian smooch mocktail which I liked. For food, I opted for the Herb and lemon chicken scallopini fajitas which weren't nice at all. The fajita was quite stale and just tasted bad.However, my friends ordered the Sliced chicken with mint and coriander sauce on egg fried rice and Chicken chorizo and garlic shrimp open sandwich which were both quite nice.Further we also ordered the garlic bread with...read more"

This place is meant for groups looking for drinks at throw away prices and for such groups any food tastes the same after couple of drinks.

Our total bill was of 3200/- (approx).Had a really great time! Well done you guyz!üëç"
787,"A new decent addition to many cafes in cp. The owners chose an interesting concept and tried to decorate the place similarly. The interior section is heaven and the terrace is hell. Being a hot day, I decided to sit in heaven. The ambience was somehow pointing to heaven. However the chairs are uncomfortable and at some places there is a huge gap between the two people sitting opposite to each other.The Sheesha and food are nice. Apart from the ambience concept nothing different to offer. However, if prices are slashed and some offers are given to the guests, then it might become a big hit. "

794,"Well tried this place out cause we were short on time and couldn't get a seat at farzi, ambience is average - please set your playlist guys, nobody likes to listen to same 3 songs 30 times, starters were great we salt and pepper and tandoori stuffed potato, for main course we ordered hot sauce pizza, after taking 15 min the waiter was able to serve us bland tasteless pizza, i wouldn't recommend this place if you want to enjoy quality food.

795,"Rediculous service. We reserved table over phone & verified if stags are allowed, once we reached they argued for stag entry. We entered, manager offered the table, we took the table and sat there which was offered. Manager came to our table and asked us to leave the table saying its reserved though there was no reserved tag!!! Worst cafe experience.

But overall Ambience is good. and now coming to food. After working out on the menu the good and happening we found out is stuffed(smoked) chesse kabab and the best you should try in OMG."
799,Cafe omg is a beautifully decorated peaceful place. Very soothing music and the artefacts put on decoration are a treat for the eyes.We checked in in absolute hurry and were only there for a snack. As we got to the first floor the first thing that left me in awe was the heavenly mother Mary putting Jesus to sleep in an animated painting where the angels were playing violens!! Its a theme based cafe trying to give a glimpse of heaven. üòèThe staff is really cooperative and the service is perfect. Coming to the food we only had pasta which had unique taste. The place is fairly reasonable and I strongly recommend it!
800,I went here yesterday for a very little time. The interiors are like that of a very fine dine. The lighting is strong . The place looks rich. The ambiance didn't attract me much inspite of all this. It didn't have anything extraordinary to separate it from rest of the usual lounges. The bar looks great though. The service is amazing. Staff is courteous. All the best to this new place !! 
801,Thanks to radio mirchi dey gave me a voucher of 4000 bugs to spend @ this cafe... The ambience and presentation is good..... Was not full on a Sunday evening..... Dj is nice he plays soothing songs which will not hurt your ears..... About the taste not sure......... Kinda above average...... Can be tried....
802,"I've always had a thing for theme based restaurants. You always get to experience something beyond what you have imagined. The same thing happened when I visited this restaurant. The interiors give you a feel as if you're in heaven with artificial ceiling and golden pillars and a lot more.Coming to the food, we first ordered Mushroom Galouti and Paneer Shaslik Tiranga. Mushroom galouti was not of my personal liking as I'm not a mushroom person and did not stand out throughout the meal. Paneer shaslik came in a big earthen pot which had coal at the bottom to keep the paneer warm and 3 types of paneer tikka inside the pot.

Very nice comfortable seating arrangements and a good open rooftop space. Less crowd because the place is very new but have to say the quality of services and food is excellent. The LIIT tasted like it has been mixed properly with 5 liquids. We also ordered Chicken Bruchetta which came in a nicely dressed way. Both the orders did not take much time, given it was Friday night. Good going guys. Keep it up. "
805,"As the name suggests, located in the heart of the city, the place is Oh My God place! All the credit goes to restaurant king Umang Tiwari for giving us so many cool options in the city like Oh My God!

With the feeling of heaven, the place makes sure you get the best experience. We started our food journey with their mocktails.

807,"Sitting in Chaayos and watching people go upstairs so excited, I used to wonder what place that would be. One day, we tried it. First, the wall art of an angel made of buttons stuns you and raises your expectations as to what lies ahead. Then, you enter a place that has been themed on HEAVEN. Well, I haven't been to heaven so can't comment on that, but there were certainly some elements that were click worthy. The small light show on tables was appetizing to be precise. (You can check it out on my Insta feed @mansilausdeo) However, I could never imagine a bar in heaven but it was there. We ordered some pasta. Honestly, nothing heavenly about it.

Beautifully done red-gold interiors and the music being played in the background create pleasing vibes.Its a spacious cafe with a hell-heaven theme. It was relatively less occupied during the early evening hours. We were here for a short while. So tried only a few drinks. They were just perfect. Service was quick. Had an amazing experience."
809,"If you are looking for a banquet hall. Then this is the place to visit. However , if you like good ambiance and food. Then definately this is not the place. The only thing which was good was the staff. They also know that DJ was not playing good songs and it was like a middle class wedding environment. I was bit late and every place in CP was full. SO i chose this . However , it turned out to be a wrong decision. The only point to be here is Hukah and if you have friends who can enjoy Hukah rather then boring music."

815,"With a new restaurant coming up every week in CP, we are always looking to try something new whenever we are in CP. This tempted us to try this newly opened theme based cafe named Cafe OMG. Basically the interiors of this place are designed to give you a feel as if you were in heaven with an elephant hanging, attached to the ceiling and some roman gods depicted here and there. The seating options were plenty and we chose the one near to the window and the big projector screen. Though the couches were very comfortable, some of the tables looked a little worn out. A thing which impressed us was, above some tables a projector was fitted to display a video on the table which depicted the...read more"

Needed a leisurely evening and got one. Many thanks. "

818,The ambience of the place was nice. It was quite spacious and the best part ac was working awesomely in a day with temp of close to 40. We ordered white sauce pasta which was quite tasty and had a good amount of cheese in its thick sauce. It was quite tasty. The babycorn and American corns dish was brilliant and we kept going for more portions of it. It was crispy and salty to the right quality. The service was good and the music was really upbeat yet pleasant.
819,"Ok place, the music is very loud... Got to literally scream to be heard . The place is quiet big...... The food presentation like 3 flavor tikka is nice in a clay pot with 3 skewers each has different flavored chicken  same was the case with paneer. The chutney in small cooker was quiet nice I feel(0pic attached)The dance area is not so big so can see people dancing anywhere and everywhere on the floor beside their tables . Oh did I mention it's on the 2floor . Hookah was quiet expensive though at 1399 plus taxes. Rest of the things were ok price wise. So will I got again ?may be...(please don't forget to follow me) Thanks. "
820,A good ambience and a great food that is what defines cafe omg. They serve the food in unique fashion that looks so awesome for example the chicken tikka in a earthen pot and the hookah is also unique a must go to place for a cp visitor.
821,"Hi there,I was to host a getogether for 14 friends so decided on 'Oh My God' . I had heard about its heaven & hell concept...... It surely was a good decision .couldnt have asked for more ....... Cos they had delicious food to deliver & great English numbers & Bollywood  music to top it with .Some men of our group went to the terrace , so called hell which was open to sky & enjoyed the view of Connaught place & the Indian Flag fluttering at night hoisted on the grounds of the inner circle...... Heaven was fine dining with hookahs & our meals coming our way as early as possible ...... Will surely visit again & again It was an evening to remember."
822,"As the name suggest the place is Oh My God. i have been to mostly all the clubs in Delhi so i wanted to try this club as i was reading good reviews about the place, first time i felt that Zomato review could be misleading. Now actual review1. Ambiance -  Poor, The decor of the club was golden and they wanted to give it a heaven look and failed miserably, the chairs with heart shape back, OMG what were you thinking. The atmosphere  was boring with sad music and even the crowd was not lively. 2. Staff - i have been to clubs in Delhi go and the staff there is lively, smiling but it was missing there as well. i understand that if the place is full the waiters are busy and they tend to...read more"
823,OMG- Its not always about food but place as well. Sometimes its about both. And the only reaction after visiting OMG was OMG :-)Evening started with Mocktails and endearing Hukka's. The Pan flavored Hukka made my day. Chilli potatoes and veg chowmin were the best in taste. The service and presentation also made us sit there for quite long time. Overall its a place one should surely visit. Not only for food but for the ambience and service. We will visit here soon......
824,"The place is beautifully designed and conceptualized. The ambience is perfect. Food is absolutely ravishing but the service is not too great, the waiters are poorly trained. And this isn't the place where you go with your family."
825,"I went to this place in a Saturday night and it was everything one would want for it. The drinks were nice, the hookah good and food better than most lounges and the music commercial. If you're looking to have a decent time(nothing exceptional). "
826,"New place, perfect ambience to dine out and relax the weekend. Starters were perfect üëå delicious and awesome. Restaurant staff were really good. Need to work on the music. Really need some bollywood stuff here. "
827,The place is average aa compared to other good pubs in delhi..  Despite a booking we hvnt been provided a table at the desired place. In the superhot summer they gave us a roof top which we didnt like.  The food was also not great! 
828,I just cant find any flaw in this place...The best Hookah (Sheesha) in town hands down.The concept is new and innovative. Decent space with the most comfortable couches spread with lot of room to walk. They did a great job by not adding too many tables which they easily can. Service was just overwhelming. So responsive and apt. Prices are much better than many places out there. Drinks are as per expectations or in their term heavenly. Food was delicious with large quantities.Music played was Cool top trending hits at just perfect volume to even have conversations. Definitely visiting again.
829,"Cafe omg has the best hukkah in town! And special varities of food..The best part is the ice cocktail..its concept is awesome.The smoke is soo smooth, doesn't even feel like anything on the pallete. The food is gr8 and the service  is also very good..one should visit for the hukka and unique concept coktails and mocktails ..The theme of hell and heaven will be loved by everyone as the lighting is unique and impressive..But the hukka and cocktaisl are the benchmark of the cafeomg..Great work by smoke machine!"
830,"It takes immense vision to plan a concept, come up with a unique name and an interior to match, and finally surpass it in execution. I have been planning on a visit to OMG since some time, and finally got the chance couple of days back. As i stepped in, to say i was awestruck would be an understatement. How can one transform a piece of area so stunningly unless they are in Hogwarts. The elliptical columns and curvulets, gold adorning pillars and structures, regal and plush furniture, artificial ceiling unlike anything i have seen  before - like another sky with clouds. The interiors are designed to give a celestial vibe, i almost felt like i walked into heaven. Sitting at the heavenly...read more"
831,"Cafe Oh My God is a new addition to the restaurant scene at CP, and also to the Big Fish Ventures portfolio. A nice change from the cookie-cutter restaurants, all offering nearly identical dishes, this place brings forth some unique dishes. The decor of the restaurant is in line with the 'heaven' theme derived from its name, all in hues of gold, with harps on the corners and paintings of halos, angels and doves on the walls.What's nice is that they have a pretty diverse menu. What's even better is that variety doesn‚Äôt supersede taste and they do all the dishes well.We went there for a tasting and tried the following items:Paneer Shashlik Tiranga: A really great dish where they had...read more"
832,"The new cafe by Umang Tewari and Big Fish Ventures arrives in the heart of the capital Connaught Place. ""Cafe Oh My God!"" is located in the inner circle of Connaught place in the ""F"" block above Chaayos. The cafe is based of two themes, one floor of the cafe is ""Hell"" & the other floor is ""Heaven"" I was invited for the sunday brunch, it was completely crowded with the bloggers. In the first look the cafe looks stunning, from interiors to theme to bar and the sunlight coming of the windows."
833,The name of the place has fascinated me for too long. Finally got a chance to go there. As you will climb the stairs a serene heavenly music will reach your ears which honestly will creep you out. The interior again is 'godly' but the plush sofa will make up for it. But what was truly heavenly about the place was the food. You take one bite and you are already amongst the Angels of God. It is not exactly economical but worth trying once. P.s. The service is good. They got me a 15% discount.
834,"This place was highly recommend by a friend for it's white sauce pasta and i must say it was the best pasta I had in the past few months. The ambience here is a little different from what we are used to here in Delhi. But yes it's a good different. The service is excellent. For food we ordered a white sauce penne pasta and a double cheese pizza. The pizza wasn't as good, it didn't have the cheesyness we were expecting. However, the white sauce pasta is a must try. "
835,"I went here with my friends and hubby darling.Oh my god has got a very special charm to it...it made me feel very lively when I went inside..it can be the hospitality, the music, the good food or the ambiance!Ambiance as the name suggests is concept based on heaven...ul see clouds painted..ul see the halos...it's very pretty..Coming to the food...everything was so delicious except the tofu which we ordered..What we ordered-bhut jholakia chic wings..it was really good..very succulent..however not at all spicy..Veg nachos...which was above average but nothing great..Chicken burger was good too.

838,"It's like having drinks in clouds with the Roman gods!!! Very royal d√©cor with soothing lights. Lavish bar. Tried the chicken drumsticks in bbq sauce- Crispy outside juicy inside (no m not talking about KFC!) The bbq sauce was complimentary n blended well with the spices of the chicken. Portions are filling. The LIIT was served in a justifiable tall glass and very very smooth!! Just the right amount and blend. Good peppy music, decent crowd. Prices are pretty much the same as it's competitors. Cheers!!!"
839,"Extremely high standard of cuisine, coupled with great lounge atmosphere. Very courteous/happy staff. A real pleasure. All friends very impressed. I will return!!Superbbbb Oh My God.... "
840,"Super ambience , gr8 food , amazing cocktails and quick service . Oh my god is a new entrant in Connaught place . I visited them with my Friends for dinner and we were not disappointed . They have some very unique and amazing cocktails  that you should surely try ( the Adam's apple , Black Russian etc )"
841,"Ambience of this place is Heavenly, literally. :PSomething very different I've seen in a long time. The food here was good too and they have nice and different flavours of sheesha. What stole the show was The Adam's Apple (A cocktail). It came trapped inside a sugar ball. It was unique and taste was good too. Over all a really nice place. Must visit. üôÇ"
842,"The very first thought when you enter OMG is actually OH MY GOD ! the place is beautifully designed from ground up and is definitely very different from other lounges in the vicinity. Located conveniently in the inner circle, the place is easy to find and you ll see the heavenly structures both inside and outside.¬†The place serves some really awesome cocktails. The signature cocktails come with a heady mix of alcohol. The signature drink comes with a variety of alcohol options and is served with a sugar ball which you have to break with a hammer and mix it up. I tried the once with whiskey. They call it TANGERINE.For starters, we had PEACH & JALAPENO POT STICKERS, basically dimsums...read more"
843,"What a place it is.. Way too good ambience, but not so good food. During our visit we ordered a couple of drinks the shake tasted good and fresh but my LIIT has a little more content of ice. The food was decent. Good service but very good decor."
844,"For those of you who worry excessively about whether you will end up in Heaven or Hell, a visit to Cafe OMG might give you a perspective of where you want to go. The new restaurant by BigFish Ventures is a restaurant which will take you to Heaven & Hell. The first floor is Heaven and the second is Hell. ¬†Floor Heaven is decorated by angels and flying animals in the midst of fluffy clouds and Hell was under construction when we visited."
845,Nice place...good music ..the only thing that is missing here is dance floor ..they must have some area for dancing..overall good was good ..drinks were tasting great ..I would want this place to have a dance floor ü§òüèª
846,"After food,the most important consideration while picking a restaurant or cafe is its ambience~Umang Tiwari's latest venture Oh My God  scores big on both.Its hard not to be impressed by the innovative interiors~beautiful mural of Angel along the staircase ushers you into the cafe with a sky look alike ceiling,vibrant red & gold decor,designed on the concept of heaven & hell- the hell section though is yet to be unveiled.Appetisers we really recommend :For Vegetarians       ~Sundried Tomato Soya Tikka (soft soya chaap coated with sundried tomatoes)      ~Achari Vada Pao with lasuni chutney (perfectly spiced Batata vada in Pao)       ~ Peach and Jalape√±o pot stickers with spicy...read more"

The ambience get full marks for the soothing interiors. This place has two sections - heaven and hell. The first floor is heaven while the second is hell. No, I am not talking about the experience but the themes. Food is as good and tasty as it gets to be. We ordered veg filly spring rolls and achari vada pao to eat.

The theme is very unique for me.Service is Slow .Starters -Nothing about this place is absolutely special or amazing.I liked the Mushroom Shots with Garlic Bread and Classis chicken Seekh Kebab.Apart from these everything(chicken skewers, chicken drumstick, jalape√±o dimsums) were okayish or below average.Main course-Mains were clearly way better than the starters.Glass Noodles, Murgh methi malai and Kathal pulao tasted pretty much fine.Tofu in Kiracha sauce was different and pretty...read more"

Commendable service,ambience ,music and food as well And ya not to forget the mind-blowing sheesha available Trust me you wont find better than thatA must go place where you'll find everything just beyond imagination and from the monotonous things available nearby in connaught place"
851,"OMG-OH MY GOD, another Bar and lounge, opens gates in the heart of Connaught Place for food connoisseurs to experience a wholesome eclectic culinary experience to guests. An another brainchild of Garam Dharam, Vault-Bar & caf√© , 3 Pegs Down, The Junkyard caf√©, BandStand caf√© Owners & Businessman, Umang Tiwari, the restaurant draws inspiration from Hell & Heaven that could be feel in every corner of restaurant either in the form wall painting or cotton cloudy ceilings."
852,"I read the reviews here before visiting the place, and yes the ambience is really good. But come on, when you're hungry, the ambience does not matter a bit. To my surprise the food was really awful, I don't know whether they were added flavours or fragrance, but it was just not upto the mark. The staff also needs to be groomed, they almost banged every dish on the table while serving, and most of them were expressionless."
853,"Oh My God in Connaught Place is one among many restaurants in this area. Given that every other restaurant here is non distinguishable from each other, it is tough competition for them. They should be at the top of their act to make a name for themselves. We recently visited Oh My God to experience this place."
854,"Oh My God is an extremely heavenly place to be . Starting from the interiors, i must mention that they have the best interiors and the most innovative designing of the cafe . It's like you have entered heaven and you literally get the real feel of the fantasy world . For the whole time I was there in the cafe looking up, down and on different sides , the only three words that came out of my mouth were Oh My God , because it truly very beautiful a place to be .

Huge couches are spread across the room with the walls being depicted with images of angels. The ceiling showcases the clouds with cotton adding to the additional effect. They also have really beautiful chairs with heart shaped head rest.

860,"A decent place with a nice ambiance. Tried mushroom gaulati and penne pasta, presentation of food is good too, pasta was not up to the mark. Must say the staff is courteous and service oriented. "
861,"We went yesterday to this place in CP for brunch, we ordered penne pasta with alfredo parmesan sauce, we totally loved the pasta, we had couple of veg pizzas which were also good but pasta was something which i really loved :)Place had a good ambience with light music and very comfy sofas to sit!They can always improve in terms of service, although the staff was courteous but it was quite difficult to get hold of them! So would rate their service to be just above average.We didnt have any hookah lover with us, however most of the people there were enjoying hookah.Would surely revisit this place again :)"
862,"I visited OH MY GOD  on sat. Night 7/5/2016with my friends. We didn't know the type of its cafe but the new look or interior  sounded promiscious to me. Unfortunately I proved myself wrong.The cafe had nothing to be proud of. The quality of ""food"" was tooo bad, The personell was far too arrogant and inattentive to the needs of the custmer.            which was very annoying. I booked the seeting for 15 pax. They give us for only 10. The whiskey was served after 30 min. Of order. At the time of booking mr. Nitin told me they play the bollywood music after 11:00 pm. And now he  told me ' sir our policy has been changer we only play the english nos.' All the commitments he done...read more"
863,"Found the place average. We went here specifically to have their sun dried tomato soya tikka but unfortunately it wasn't available. The staff was kind enough to serve us with sun dried tomatoes, for which we craved, with the other appetizer we ordered. It was falafel disks. Found it average. It had no dip with it and tasted very dry.. The ambience is also average but music was good! "
864,"Yet another good place in CP. Nice ambience, good food and refreshing drinks.Talking about the food, I started with the Peach and Jalape√±o Pot stickers which were scrumptious and spicy with optimum heat and flavor. Next We tried many starters one after another viz Mushroom Galouti, Mini Falafel Disk, Veg Phyllo Spring Rolls, Jerk Chicken DrumSticks, Kacchi Ambi Chicken Tikka and Tandoori Tomato spiced Soya Tikka.

866,"Went with high expectations but was completely disappointed. Right from boorish, non responsive staff, to delayed orders it was a complete disaster. We ordered Andhra mutton to begin with - after half an hour we were served what we can only describe as RAW mutton. In Gordon Ramsay's immortal words, a good Vet would have been able to bring that lamb back to life. Needless to say, we walked right out after paying the bill. Never again. "

868,A new bar and lounge that‚Äôs opened up in Connaught Place is Oh My God (OMG). You are literally welcomed by a huge poster of God as you walk up the stairs to enter this place. The concept behind the interiors is the depiction of heaven and hell with sections reflecting these two extremes. Its close to gate number 5 of the Rajiv Chowk Metro station. The place is dimly lit and has a relaxed laid back vibe. They have huge couches spread across the room to provide an easy relaxed meal or you can always choose to be upfront for your drinks and opt to sit on the high chairs at the bar.
869,"OMG again being a theme based restaurant has focused a lot on the d√©cor and the props. However the place hasn't done too much with the interiors which is kind of good. Based on Heaven and Hell theme the restaurant has given its two floors two different theme. While heaven is a calm floor with good lighting and soft music, hell is dark with loud music. They have a huge bar and some excellent drinks are served here. Coming to the food.

887,"Ambience and Decor: 4/5Oh my God is a theme based Cafe, its theme being heaven. At the top of the stairs,there is this cool gif-audio-video-thing which is haunting too! The decor is very 'heavenly'. There are harp like structures here and there, cotton clouds, a beautiful golden hue all over the place due to the lighting, huge murals of angels etc. There is a terrace seating area too which is not yet open to public.Service: 3/5Value for money: 3.5/5The prices are at par with the other cafes in CP. The service was kind of slow (I had ordered a cocktail, waited for a long time, gave 2 reminders, waited some more and finally went up to the bar myself). I can cut it some slack...read more"

890,"‚ÄúOh My God‚Äù is the latest entry into the mystic world created by Umang Tiwari and team. Its very conveniently located in F block, inner circle of Rajiv Chock. Inspired by Hell and Heaven and seemingly out of a bollywood block buster with a similar name ‚ÄúOMG‚Äù, the joint has the typical signature charm of Umang Tiwari. Great ambiance and d√©cor; though I am not sure how long the whiteness of the cotton used to depict clouds will last. As the name suggests it is a theme based caf√©; Heaven and Hell style. One sure feels like entering a mystical environ but the charm fades away soon as you look up. The place does have some good starters, but I was not happy with the main course...read more"
