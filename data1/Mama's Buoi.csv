21,"Perfect place to experience customer disservice! They have 101 ways to spoil your experience, constant glaring from managers to ignored calls by waiters to dysfunctional water purifiers. Imagine the worst and they will beat it."
22,This place has a nice ambiance and seating. The rooftop seating was cozy and nice. Sadly their food is not that good.We ordered Alfredo penne pasta and garden fresh pizza. The pasta was average and lacked seasoning. The pizza was also not very good.However we liked their mocktails.
23,Food was good. White sauce pasta could be better. Decent ambience
24,"The food is great and the ambience too but the shakes are really pathetic..Please improve the quality of your Shakes.. It's really like drinking raw milk. Also, service is kinda slow."
25,Rude Staff and Manager... Not children friendly... would have never visited it if knew this cafe has goon's as its customer. Worst cafe in Hudson Lane
26,"If zomato provides negative points,i would like to give that to mama buoi.Today we went here and we find the worst service here.Their waiters don‚Äôt know how to talk to the customers.They argued with us for the seats and even insulted us.Won‚Äôt recommend anyone to go here.They keep on shifting us from here to there and when we said no,they argued with us.No manners how to handle the customers."

29,We tried North Indian food and mocktails. Their paneer lababdaar and garlic naan were finger licking good and mocktails were good too. Will love to visit this place again in future.
30,"Mama's buoi is one of the most costliest cafe in Hudson Lane. The cafe has an amazing ambience with both indoor seating and roof top seating.Ambience is awesome and very photogenic.We tried many dishes and among them I loved the Butter Chicken Pizza most üòç it was cheesy and loaded with chicken. then we had noodles and manchurian. The quantity was enough for 2 people after having such amazing starters. Manchurian balls were small and stuffed nicely. Noodles had good amount of spices as per the Hakka noddles. Whenever you are thinking to enjoy in Hudson Lane and have good pocket to spend, then it is a go to place for you, for sure!"
31,"I along with my brother visited this restaurant a little late in the afternoon.As it was cold outside, so we settled for the in-house restaurant instead of rooftop. Ambience was perfect with slow music in the background ideal for people who doesn't like loud music and crowdy places . Coming to the starters, we ordered grilled fish , chicken lababdaar,masala peanuts.All 3 dishes were delicious in taste. Let me just mention that grilled fish (served with vegetables , mayonnaise and sauces)is a must try for all. Now , coming to the main course ,we had mutton Rogan Rosh and fried rice and chicken biryani. Mutton was really spicy and delicious in taste. People often won't mention about alcohol...read more"
32,Everything was perfect ..
33,"We tried the Butter chicken balls for the first time that night and the food was great, freshly cooked very tasty and well presented. The waiters were attentive and service overall was good. The restaurant looked to have been decorated. Overall a good meal and great value we will certainly be going back."
34,"It was an amazing night there. I had white sauce pasta , cheese corn pizza and butter chicken balls they were all extremely yummy and the presentation was very good"
35,"Had crispy chilli baby corn and tequila shots at this amazing cafe for hanging out. Also, had burger, sandwich, pizza and spaghetti Loved the place and its food."
36,The drinks were not upto the mark. The food was also little expensive which was not at all worth . The place was also smelling bad .
37,"Amazing Cafe to visit in Gtb nagar . I recently visited it with some of my friends and enjoyed a lot. The ambiance is cool and it has terrace sitting too which I felt makes it more amazing to visit. The food was also tasty and worth trying. We ordered- spring rolls , Pan fried noodles, Pizza and malai chicken tikka. My favourite are Spring rolls and pizza . Will surely visit again to try more delicious food."
38,"Food: DecentService: GoodAmbiance: GoodI did not find anything special with my taste buds, for the food was quiet average. The alcohol and hookah is priced decently.The service was okay, the ambiance is good. It has a big DJ area, if you're in for a Friday party. The music is too loud if you're looking to chitchat.Overall it was worth the money!"
39,"This place is located on third floor, hundson lane, Delhi. I visited this place last month end with my friends for the first time. The Ambience was amazing . Staff was polite and courteous. The food and drinks were served really quickly. Food was really good we loved the spices. This place is little bit expensive. Overall everything was good. Will visit again."
40,"This is hands down one of my favourite places to visit in Hudson Lane. From the rooftop ambience to the food to drinks, everything is pretty amazing. I went for a birthday lunch and it was pretty amazing. North Indian is so delicious here that you will keep licking your fingers. A must-go-to place in GTB Nagar area."
41,Every thing is good staff is also great ambience is great i like mamas boi
42,"The ice in the drink was so old. Paper like thing was floating over my drink. But they did nt change it, instead they just gave me in some other glass and they thought as if I didn‚Äôt notice."
43,Lil bit delayed services rest everything was perfect 
44,This place is amazing with the taste n the ambiance too really !!
45,"Mama's buoi is an amazing place to hang out with friends especially the roof top. They have ample space for parties. Came here for lunch and tried there Mexican delight chicken burger, Tiranga soya chaap and cornitos(nachos). All of the dishes were delicious. I loved there Cornitos which had amazing feeling of tomato salsa and cheese, you can't miss those.Everything was on top of taste and we really enjoyed from burger to chaap to drinks to hospitality.All in all thumbs up for staff and food experience."
46,santosh services was very good place is also good for frnds and fmly
47,Santosh service was too good place was also very good for frnds and fmly 
48,"Was served by Santosh yadav, had great sheesha and amazing service. Must visit"
49,"Mama's buoi, amazing experience with my friends, enjoyed the food with the music. Rooftop experience was good. I tried veg momos, pizza, sangria,chicken sandwich with fries, chilly garlic noodles, and everything was really tasty and upto my expectations. Enjoyed alot, will visit this place again."
50,Worst restaurant in GTB Nagar. The service is really slow. Waiters simply don't listen here. The food is served in hours and that too cold and tasteless.
51,"Dirty tables, unhygienic place, rude wIters and totally tasteless food. I regretted visiting this place. "
52,"I have been to this place multiple times..Just an amazing placeIt has the beautiful ambienceThe aura made me feel so goodThe food was also very palatableI had pizza,spring rolls,momos,nachosEverything tasted amazingMust visit"
53,"There is only rooftop right now as there is some renovation is going on. Their drums of heaven, chicken tikka and garlic breads were nice. Their virgin mojito was average. They serve hookah but it is little bit expensive. They charge more than 1000 rupees for that."
54,The place is quite good in terms of food and as well as the ambience. I had small issues like quantity of salt and spice in some of the dishes otherwise it was nice. 
55,"I love the vibe of this place. Ambience is super cool. And you must go there on weekends for the live music, its a different vibe‚ù§i love the food, staff and everythingü§©"
56,"Awesome music , gud food , beautiful interiors. Pls just renovate Ur rooftop. The view is gr8 but needs a paint, but everything gets covered by the ambience and your live band. Ur pizzas r delicious"
57,Hi! Could you please tell me the price of a single/double flavoured hukkah? I found this chrome but not here on zomato :) please do let me know the price of a hookah if still served. 
58,Astounding feel stunning sustenance. My most loved spot in Gtb nagar. I had margarine chicken and paneer spread masala. Everything tasted delightful. Staff was inviting and kind. Adored the spot. In case you're searching for a bistro for tasty and pocket well disposed social gathering than this spot is the one. It's the ideal spot to mess around with companions. Likewise I would propose this for birthday parties.
59,Expected more from this place. The food could be better and the ambience too. Hope they can improve on this and my next visit is successful! 
60,Lovely Ambiance ‚Ä¢ Low on Pocket ‚Ä¢ Great Food ‚Ä¢ Alcohol AvailableWhat we tried:Drums of Heaven (4.5/5)Whiskey (30 ml)A pint of Beer
61,A very spacious restaurant with a great atmosphere. Their chicken soup is delicious. North Indian cuisine is yummy specially Butter chicken. Great place to dine with your family. Kids friendly also with a lot of variety in the menu.
62,"We a group of four visited the place on a Monday evening. Normally you expect someone to greet you. But Noone seemed to care.Finally, we found a cleaning guy who was ready to talk and he told us to go upstairs. The claim of no stag entry is false(I'm not against that but one shouldn't make false claims), terrace didn't look friendly and the sex ratio was skewed.They had so much of space there but they refused to give a decent place to sit even when we had reservations.They don't honor Zomato reservations, the guy in a red shirt showed a fake list even when I was showing reservation on my phone. The guy in red shirt (9th September)is toxic and will take this place down with his stupid...read more"
63,"The ambience was okay okay. The service of this place was good. Talking about the food , it was nice. The prices were also reasonable as compared to other cafes on Hudson lane."
64,"Ambiance was really good..food quality was lit but quantity was really really less and yeah, prices are quite high..their chilli potato were yumm and had the best pizza I ever had.. and mocktails were really good too..burger wasn't that good and coriander dimsums were really bad in taste"
65,The ambience and food of this place is amazing.It is a great spot to hang out with friends in gtb nagar. I mainly tried the dessert death by chocolate.It was amazing.The service is good here and the staff listens to you politely.All in all I had a nice experience.
66,The food is great here. There was great seating available. The interior was so beautiful and it was neat and clean. The desert was so mouthwatering. You all should visit there once....!
67,"No regard for customers .........Saif the Singer - you rocked mate ....We will come to other cafe where you will perform but not Mama‚Äôs Buoi...DISAPPOINTING UPSETTINGDISRESPECTFUL It‚Äôs our right as a customer that we can choose to pay SERVICE TAX OR NOT , but saying that it‚Äôs your policy that you have to apply that to the bill is B**** S****No pint wasting money here ...We have lot more good cafes in Hudson lane ...I myself owns a Bar but this kind of behaviour is not acceptable...You guys lost a good client !! "
68,They have a pretty good service as well as good food but my most favourite has been their spring rolls. They had a small space for dancing too and the dj was quite good. Had a good time there.
69,"Amazing ambience. Food is quite delicious! Do order the veg platter, it is droolworthy. Also the Dirty Double Chocolate Shake is awesome. The staff is quite friendly and helpful. "
70,"I ordered Veg Salt & Pepper and it was perfectly Crispy and Tasty!! Then we couldn't resist ordering more which includes Soup, Pizza, Chicken Bucket and Magic Moments!! Everything was Perfect. Also there was a Birthday Party so we got to see Dance Performances!! Music was upbeating! Overall it was a nice experience with a great staff!! Just an issue that the staff members are usually standing near the Bar so its a bit difficult to call them for an order or any other issue given that the music is turned on! So please help in with this issue!"
71,"A small Though classy cafe., Located around 1kms away from GTB nagar metro station.I was there With My friends. Initially we were a little bit disappointed Since their Rooftop was temprorarily closed but our Food & Drinks made Us worth Staying üòÄHope to visit their Rooftop soon.Service was good & friendly staff.Overall :- 4üåü"

77,"Loved the interiors and the roof top scene of this cafe with lovely live music playing.Ordered Paneer Tikka, cheese sticks, dahi k kebab in starters m Everything was top notch.Drinks were fantastic. Virgin Sangria was so refreshing.Choco double shake and strawberry shake was on point."
78,"Heard a lot about this place, so I finally decided to try it. Firstly the interiors of the place are not good (its too dark inside ), secondly the staff lacks courtesy. Coming to food , it‚Äôs above average, but not better than other competitors. Totally student friendly place, families can avoid it. "
79,So yesterday me and my friend visited this gem place Mama's Buoi. Was highly satisfied with the ambience and the kind of services. The ambience was very fascinating.From the starters menu we ordered:Nachos bhel puri: 5/5Veg platter : 4/5Chilli pizza: 5/5Honey chilli potato : 5/5From the drinks menu we ordered:Dirty double 5/5Mama's sangria 5/5From the deserts menu we ordered:Death by chocolate 5/5 (recommended )So to sum up a very nice experience will definitely visit again.

81,I went to this place with my friends. My experience was not good. The couch we were sitting on was moist & air conditioner drops were falling on us. The food I tried:1- Dirty Double Shake- 2/52- Mama's Signature Pizza - 3.5/5‚Äê--------------------------------------------------------Service - 2.5/5Ambience - 3.5/5
82,A nice place for light evening snacks along with some refreshing drink like Mojito or sodaaa. Ambience is good and service is reasonably fast!!!
83,Mamma's buoi is a great place to hang out with college friends. Th starter dishes are amazing. Especially the drums of heaven thy are crispy and taste delicious. The mocktails are very refreshing and the ambience is nice. The service is also very good and the staff is very polite. They have hookah and and a range of cocktails to pick from. One can easily host birthday parties and other fun activities. It's a brilliant experience.
84,Mamma's buoi is a very fun place in the bustling Hudson place. It's vibe is very energetic and the food is absolutely delicious. The menu is quirky and has some interesting dishes to try like the butter chicken balls. They're really a must try. The starters are great and the best part about the place is their range of mocktails. Every drink is so refreshing especially the laughing melon and signature Sangria. The ambience is awesome and one should definitely go to mamma's buoi to enjoy with their friends after classes.
85,My most favorite place in Gtb nagar this is. Amazing ambience amazing food. Their live music at night is the best part of this place. Totally love it. Their shakes are most tasty in Gtb nagar. Will visit again very soon 
86,"No problems with the food, but the beer options have been Taken down to just 3,probably a supplier syndication but not good for the patrons! Not even breezer is available.We had to move thrice and talk to the Manager two times to get a comfortable ambiance as they were not willing to put the airconditioning on full, Delhi is having much cooler temperatures than peak summers already.The third and the biggest, complaint is they do not remove service charge even when requested to from the bill.Big thumbs down"
87,Mama buoi : woahh what an amazing place . Loved their ambience amazing lightning and atmoshphere inside the ambience . The staff wass polite and humble. Outlet was clean and hygenic as i tried their.1) mushroom2) butter chicken balls3) keema pizza4) drums of heaven5) chicken lollipopOverall great experience . The food was so yum. The service was very fast .. must visit this place.
88,"I went to this place with my friends. For starters I had paneer tikka, veg tandoori platter, butter chicken balls and pizza. For mains I had butter chicken and paneer butter masala. Everything tasted delicious. Staff was welcoming and kind. Loved the place. If you're looking for a cafe for delicious and pocket friendly get together than this place is the one."
89,Mama's buoi is in the busy Lanes of Gtb Nagar. It's on third floor and also has terrace seating available which is one of the best terrace in the town. It's has a very happening ambiance with full of enjoyment dja dn lot more. Veg and non veg both options are available here. It's the perfect place to have fun with friends. Also I would suggest this for birthday parties
90,Ambience is nice.... It is located in hudson lane....The best thing that I found here was oreo shake.... The only thing that was not good was servicing and the waiters... I personally found them rude. 
91,"Service is pathetic and u will kept calling waiters but they won‚Äôt listen.If by chance they listen,they will not cater ur request till 5-7reminders.Music n food is good but in the end if no one is there to serve u or fulfill ur service request then it useless.Mama‚Äôs Buoi is not so good in service,hence 2stars."
92,The classsic oreo shake was very tasty and it is mouth watering not only it has taste it satifies the soul alsoo the price i a bit high but it is worth the money
93,Ok type place ambience wise. Too much hype turns out to be a small restaurant. Young girls with hookas all around. Too much smoke. Wont recommend families with children. Food was good. The look and feel of restaurant was average.
94,Service is very poor. 5 waiters are standing and staring but no one bothers to come and take the order. Very poor service and they charge 10% service charge even after so bad service. Highly disappointing. 
95,A cafe cum lounge look ambience but the best part is they have open terrace sitting where you can sit and enjoy weather as well. The serve good food with best music. You can enjoy the ambience with tempting food. Worth for money.  
96,I love to visit this place. Food was tasty and yummy. It was great to see such place here.. the staff was very cooperative. Just one suggestion - please do fast deliver your dishes. thank you for your hospitality.
97,"The place contradicts zomato rating. Even the peppy music could not liven the place. Undercooked rice, poor service and unflavored dimsum filling are the highlights."
98,"From arranging tables to bringing food, the service was appalling. The waiting staff was more interested doing group talks. The taste was below averageHoney chilli- 3/5Chicken coriander dimsums - 3/5Chicken stroganoff - 1/5 ( undercooked rice)Garlic rice - 1.5/5 (undercooked rice)"
99,Badly managed bookings and guests. It should be banned. Completely horrible experience. If there is any negative rating I will give them that.
100,"Heard a lot about this place so, on last Thursday visited here, indian folk in the windy night which was perfect to the weather. The food was below avg. Chicken wings  3/5Chicken lasagna 2.5/5Mozzarella Cheese (sticks) 3/5Mama‚Äôs Sangaria 4/5Ambience 4.5/5Worth 3.5/5"
101,Polite place to visit enjoy in air have good food enjoy with friends workers are also so kind order on time one of the best in gtb nagar up to date
102,Ambience was great . You can go for the terrace for a romantic dine with your loved ones. Food is good in tastes . The chocolate sundae I loved the most. But there service was alil bit slow. 
103,Being a south delhi girl and going all the way to north delhi was a task but still for food I‚Äôve to travel so I went to mama‚Äôs buoi and the ambience was nice they have a roof top and indoor sitting both options are available we choose to sit outside and we ordered all this much which includes:Cheese NachosMix sauce penne pastaLIIT drinkSpring rollChilly patatoChivas shotCorona Just a reminder if You‚Äôre not 25 or above don‚Äôt visit any cafe in GTB Nagar they won‚Äôt serve you. 
104,"Good food , fast service, awesome Deserts and a nice ambiance this place deserve one time visit.Not costly at all it‚Äôs totally worth for money but you might face difficulty to have a place because it is full sometimes."
105,"I went this place with my friend. Mama's buoi is one of the best cafe in Hudson lane .I heard about this cafe a lot. The ambience is lovely especially that rooftop area is a ideal spot to sit in winters. it is one of the best place to hangout with friends in University area . We ordered pizza oreo shake ,kitakat shake, sandwich, mojito ..overall food was very good..staff was very cooperative ..they helped us with their menu ..I must say one of the finest place to have good food . I will definitely go again with my friends"
106,Very good food and drinks. Their pizza and mix sauce pasta is a must try. Ambience is also good but their live music is in outdoor where AC doesn‚Äôt work much. So book your table wisely. 
107,Food is average. But the service was very pooor and the staff was also very very rude. I did not like the seating also. It was very conjusted. 
108,The place is good to hangout if there‚Äôs a celebration. Not a cozy place if you are someone who likes calm cafes more than the loud once with a big screen television which is on all the time. The food variety given is nice. But most of the drinks asked for were put of stock when we visited. Don‚Äôt try the ‚Äúmamas buoi special pizza‚Äù it‚Äôs tasteless. While the sandwiches are good.
109,High price with worst food in taste.I had there tandoori platter which was so pathetic.They hadn't any variant other than Paneer and Soya only.It's not recommendedable. 
110,"I have heard so much about this place but I would say i was pretty disappointed with the kind of service and the quality of the food they provide.The light was so dim that I had to use my phone flashlight to see the menu. If I have to rate the service I will give 2‚≠ê‚≠ê.I ordered burger, mocktail (Mama's sangria),pizza and Oreo shake.Apart from all this the burger and mocktail was good but for next visit I have to think twice ."
111,The place is overall seems a cool place. The rooftop area is the ideal spot to sit in here in winters. It seems a little compact but it‚Äôs not very small to sit in. Food is great. Ambeince- 4/5 Food- 4/5 Service- 4/5?
112,Recently visited this place after hearing a lot about this place. But it turns out the other way round.Music was too loud and lights were too dim. Food was okay okay.The only thing i liked about this place is their rooftop and their walnut sizzling brownie.
113,Ambience was good but i didnt like the food here....my friends nd i ordered white sauce pasta nd verdure pizza..wasted my money nd time...music was so loud i couldnt even heard my friend's voice...
114,"One of the best rooftop restaurants in the Delhi University area. Prompt service, delicious food!Not-so-expensive food, mocktails and cocktails. "
115,"I‚Äôve heard so much about this place,so went there for lunch .I was in for a huge disappointment !The food,the atmosphere,the lights the music everything about this place was wrong !!!The music was so loud,that I could barely hear my friend !The lights were so uncomfortably dim,that I had to use the flashlight from my phone to read the menu!Ordered fruit sangria. Was extra sweet!!Fully loaded veg pizza Was a bit cold,bland and the cheese  tasted a bit old!Had Alfredo pasta:it smelled of boiled mushrooms!!The only two good things were the quick service and the Polite staff... I‚Äôm never visiting this place again ."
116,Great place! Loved the food. Had a marvelous time. The service is good. Drinks are refreshing and the ambience is perfect. One of my favorite places in Hudson Lane.
117,"Not a place I would recommend. For me, it's about the food and the drinks first and foremost when I go somewhere. And on that account, Mama's Buoi sucked. Pizza was a bust and the drinks were even more of a disappointment to me. We ordered all three from the mocktails menu, center one was virgin pinacolada, the left hand one was laughing Mary and the right one I don't even remember. The pizza was cold and the tiranga chaap were tasteless.If you're not a foodie, then I'm sure you'll have a nice time because of the mood lighting and the booming music. Oh and the bar too. I don't drink alcohol so can't say anything about it. But sure visit the place for celebrations and events. "
118,i like the ambience over there lil dark..and comfortable seats.. like the variety of food especially pizza it was so tasty and ceaser salad too.food -4/5hospitality-5/5Ambience -5/5I will surely recommend this place to go.
119,One of the better places in university area.Mezze platter is outstanding.Pizza was generally good.My recommendation1. Mezze platter (winner)2. Pizza3. Chilli garlic noodles
120,"Recently visited this place pretty dark ambience with some good music, humble and polite staff,pocket friendly and all on all the nice experience I say. Really going to visit this cafe again soon ."

124,"After searching for a place with some decent crowd in the GTB nagar market, we selected this place. The ambience is very basic, and looks good. It is pretty dark, so be prepared for not even getting a single good picture. Coming to the food, we ordered ‚ÄòSwiss Lindt‚Äô for drinks.

It was perfectly thick, perfectly sweet and looked really cute.For the food, we ordered ‚Äò tandoori vegetable platter‚Äô which consisted of ‚Äò 2-3 pieces of mushroom, 4 pieces of paneer( malai and tandoori), 3 pieces of chaap(pudina, Malai, achaari), and kebab‚Äô.The platter was tasty, and the quantity was good too for the price...read more"

201,"I had a mix of experience at Mama‚Äôs Buoi. The food tasted good as most of the times.

In my bill, I was not only charged INR 70 instead of 35, I was charged for two bottles. Meaning which, I had to pay INR 140 for a bottle worth INR 35. It is not uncommon for cafes to charge more prices for sodas but you should be aware of not putting something of table with the MRP. Instead, serve the drinks from the kitchen. When I reported this to the waiter, he told me because it was a bottle, I will be charged twice and MRP will not be charged on the bill. Not a very...read more"

210,Nice place for hangout. But the staff's behaviour is not appropriate. They charged service tax which is now not compulsory to pay. But the food was very nice.
211,Very poor experience. The service was very negligent and had to wait for tables even though we pre booked the table. Not going again for sure 
212,"Good food, amazing music, chilled vibe, super-energetic crowd. The music of this place is the eye candy, its a pretty place and has a pocket friendly menu. "
213,"Ambience is pretty good, they have nice sitting arrangements. But i felt food is a bit overpriced. And they don't have most of the Booze mentioned on there menu. But overall okay place to hangout for couple of hours"
214,"This place is perfect to enjoy with your loved ones and friends.Great service and delicious food.Each and every dish that I had tried was delicious , perfectly cooked and beautifully presented .

231,"I liked the live music and the ambience here. But coming to food, food was not that good.You can visit here to enjoy and hangout with friends and enjoy live music. "
232,The prawns were good and ambience was good but I didnt like the service much. One time visit but also a bit expensive a bit. Try the Prawns and Murgh Tikka.
233,I took my cousins out yesterday here for dinner. Food here was good especially the chilli garlic noodles and veg pizza we ordered with balanced flavours. Lasagne dissappointed me a bit since the lasagne layers were negligible. This cafe is affordable because they compromise with quantity. So if you want to have good cheap food but with limited quantity then this is your place.

We had a lot of fun.The ambience was v niceThe staff and service was helpful and quickComing to the food we ordered-Chilly Paneer PizzaThai Spring RollsSangria Cheese Fries and Sizzling BrownieDo try this place !!!!!!!

237,"Food - 8/10We ordered:Tiranga soya chaap, moti mushroom tikka, crispy chilli paneer, fish finger, rough liit, coffee and toblerone, peri peri fish tikka, french cosmopolitan, brave bull liit, crispy fried paprika, mama's special.Service - 6/10Waiters were busy chit-chatting most of the time.Ambience, music - 9/10Indoor area is a bit claustrophobic, but roof-top is great.Comfortable seating."

We loved the terrace area as well. Coming to the service, initially it was slow but with time everything was settled. To our dismay, they don't have a DJ floor.We ordered the following dishes:1. Mixed Grilled Sizzler: It was delicious. The quantity of spaghetti and veggies was appropriate. The only complaint is that I found it unusually salty. Otherwise, it is a must try.2. Melting moments: The cheese sticks were soft and crunchy and of course, so cheesy. The cheese pull was visible in only some of the pieces though.3....read more"

Chilli paneer pizza: paneer dices tasted as if they were not freshly made, vegetables were carelessly and unevenly spread.2. Chilli mushroom : satisfying in taste.Over all,Food: 2/5Service: 4/5Ambience: 2/5"

252,"Mama‚Äôs buoi is a very versatile eatery. I‚Äôve been here quite a few times now. The indoors area is like a lounge with a bar on the corner yet it is well lit & appropriate to visit during the day but I would always opt for the rooftop. The rooftop has interiors in shades of red & grey and you might have to wait a bit to get a table there on the weekends. So butter chicken balls, shredded honey chilli chicken, afghani paneer tikka, white sauce pasta and oreo shake were among the good things on the table but honey chilli potato were soggy & virgin mojito was disappointing.

255,Mamas buoi is a great place in hudson lane. This is one of the famous outlet in Gtb Nagar. The ambience is amazing with an added rooftop. The food is really good along with the prices.

258,The service of this restaurant was amazing and the food worth it‚Äôs price. Do taste the mama sangarita over there it‚Äôs there speciality ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è#food
259,"The restaurant staff seemed very inconsiderate to their customer's comfort or requirements. The electric lamp on terrace area sparked 2-3 times above our heads and the staff didn't seem to be bothered at all. After we changed our table, the new table had broken seats. Frustrated enough, we had to leave the place totally wasting all our money. Even then, the staff hardly cared about apologizing or even greeting us at all. Too bad a service!"
260,"It was my first time in this cafe with my friend. This place has rooftop sitting too. Staff was less attentive. We ordered Virgin Mojito, Dirty Double, Cofee and Toblerone, Honey Chilli Potato. "
261,"Not so new but yet very popular place in Hudson Lane market. Mama's buoi is perfect place to party in that area. Their rooftop sitting is the best sitting option in the whole marke. Food is also reasonable and good. Loved the Chicken Malai Tikka, Butter Chicken and Veg salt and pepper. "
262,"A beautiful place located in Hudson Lane, to enjoy your evening. The ambience is quite good alonh with the roof top which is equally good. Food quality is also good. Must try- Malai tikka and chilli chicken pizza. Service was satisfying and overall a good place for a hangout and enjoying Friday& Saturday's Nights."
263,Good place to hang around with friends. Mama's buoi serves good food plus it has great ambiance. It also has terrace area which look beautiful in the night.

Music was awesome.We ordered veg platter and shake.. panner tikka was very tasty..Food was very tasty.Presentation was Great.Amazing experienceHighly recommended placeAmbience 5/5Taste 4.5/5
266,"I went here for the second time. It‚Äôs so difficult to find a place here without prior booking. Ambience was as usual outstanding. If you want a rooftop restaurant with live music, then this is the place. I went here with one of my friend. We ordered one pan flavoured hukka and white sauce pasta. It was amazing. Staff was friendly but not all the staff there knows their speciality. I would not recommend the seating place on the third floor, it‚Äôs quite boring. If you want nightlife, then rooftop is recommended."
267,Very disappointed with many things .First - food wasn't fresh plus we ordered two items was was this fish fingers ( we have had much better once at other places ) and other was dimsums which was apparently cancelled after we have waited already for like 20 minutes.Moreover the beer was not chilled. Mama's Bailey's was fine .
268,"Oh buoi this cafe is spacious. Love the ambience there and the food is next level. They have almost all kind of sitting available one can choose from, high chairs, sofa, tables they have everything.And with that the food is so delicious. The drinks are also very nice."

274,"Service - 3Food - 3Ambience - 3Since this place is very hyped, I expected a lot but my experience here was okayish.We ordered peri peri tandoori chicken which was good but I didn't get the peri peri flavour. And the Thai red curry was kind of a no no for me too. "
275,"Good vibe, great seating and good food. The staff is friendly too.Most of the items in their dessert section is super great, and their starters are excellent also.¬†For main course, I recommend the chicken pasta - it tastes very fresh and had a nice bite to it."
276,"The workplace is supposed to be an ideal environment dat needs to b maintained nd molded by employee professionalism nd policies,,bt i found manager very unprofessional ,,despite the effort of keeping the working environment positive and conductive,,he was insensitive of his conducts and behaviour,,i found him worst at his job as he was too arogant nd which cn easily destroy ideal relationship established by odr employers,,he was too rude and loud and dis unprofessional behaviour can disrupt the workplace as a whole nd shud be dealt with as quickly as possible ,!!!!!!"
277,Mama‚Äôs Buoi is my favourite place to be at.. the best ambience & food. Mix sauce pasta is one of the best dish they serve ! Must try and must visit ! 
278,"Poor service poor management poor quality of food.spmetimes they charge twice for a same order it happened two  times with me which is proof it was not by mistake,,,,"
279,"Probably the best place to chill in north campus. Everything including food, ambience, live music and cozy vibes during night is amazing. I went there for 4-5 times and everytime it feels amazing to be here. They serve best sandwiches, crispy corn, pastas and main course. Also having sheesha at their rooftop area is a bliss. Perfect place for hangout if you are in and around north campus."
280,This place used to be good but recently I have noticed that this place is sick and lame af the manager is so dumb that he can‚Äôt manage the table reservations and then ask the guest to stand at the bar that is sick and a trouble for those guest those who waste there Saturday or weekend nights waiting for the table even after the reservation is confirmed. 
281,"Mamaaaaaaa‚Äôs Buoi!It was an amazing experience.There staff is approachable and very quick.We ordered:Paneer tikka , Garlic bread (although it wasn‚Äôt mentioned in the menu but when we asked the waiter he said it is)Ice tea (peach) , Ore shake.Dal makhni , Nan and Jeera rice.Beer and Hookah (obv).Everything was nice and presentation was great!Recommended."
282,"Yesterday I visited this place with my friends and we took our table on terrace. The view from terrace was amazing. Their ambience is too good. Staff welcomed us so warmly and their service is amazing. Food also great so as the mocktails and the best is dessert. We ordered Butter chicken balls, Jalepeno Toasts (which was amazing), Chicken lollipop (best chicken item), Arbreta Pasta and so on. In mocktails we've ordered Mama's Sangria, College Virgin Mojito, Ozzy Jumble and Innocent girl. And at the end their best Walnut Sizzling Brownie which was the dessert I ever had. Visit this place with your friends to spend an amazing evening."
283,I have been here so many times and still not over it !!! üòçI had such a wonderful time last day . Best weather. Best open seating . Spent almost 4 hours there . I have tried many of the dishes . Veg salt and pepper is my favourite . Jalape√±os toast is also nice . Mocktails are so appealing and refreshing. Service is prompt. Best bar of the town . So i think there‚Äôs no second thought about cafes when you are in Gtb nagar . Mama‚Äôs buoi is ahead of all ... üëèüèªüëèüèª

285,"Well quite after some couple of time , I was at Mama‚Äôs Buoi. And the food that makes it exptic to go on and try it would be Mama‚Äôs Signature Veg pizza, Spicy Chicken Dimsums, and Innocent Girl.Others that were good on terms to try for were(1) Mix Veg Coriander Dimsums(2) Rogan Josh(3) Chicken Biriyani(4) Death by chocolate(5) Walnut Sizzling brownieAnd to me in an overall manner the whole as in Ambience+ Behaviour of staff + serving + Portion of food + Taste of food was good.It didn‚Äôt disappoint me at all.That makes it a proper recommended place to try food at and makes it 5/5 .

326,If you are in GTB Nagar and like to enjoy on rooftop then this place is for you üíïIt has a fine dine too but I like rooftop more.I ordered Big Buddy's Burger üçîIt was really big and worth ordering.Another item was Cheese Nachos üòçIt was fully loaded with melted cheese.Ambience - 4.5/5Food - 5/5The only thing that I dislike about them was too slow service.
327,The ambience is great. The service is fast. Weekend musical nights are the best. I recently went to this place in freezing cold weather and I sat on rooftop. Arrangements were made for the weather too. But I ordered this Cheesy nachos which were not at all cheesy. Disappointed with the food. Noodles were also bland. Only white and red sauce pasta are fine. 
328,Mama's buoi in Hudson Lane is my personal favorite especially because of the rooftop. It serves delicious food with a really cool presentation. I often go there with my friends there. I've had quite a stuff from there including lots of different mocktails and shakes too.I once had their white sauce penne pasta and that I felt was too basic with not good flavours but the rest of all is really mouth watering believe me. Especially their chicken seekh kabab is my all time favorite and I always order sangria to go with it. I would also recommend you guys to try their crispy vegetables. It's a delight.

333,"This place is the best if you love roof top cafes It's ambience is just mindblowing and the live music add the charm to it's ambience.The food was good which was quite fascinating, the most was the killer by keeping the place cool. Chicken tikka and sandwiches are a must eat. The noodles were just fine. But fullmarks only because the servers were quite prompt. A good experience"

335,"Last weekend, I went to this amazing place, 'Mama's Buoy' in GTB nagar. Had heard a lot about the place so I thought of visiting it.The place lived up to my expectations and I had a great evening.Talking about the food, I really liked the Drums of Heaven. The Chicken was beautifully cooked in Schezwan sauce, which seemed mouth watering.Next I had the Chicken Dimsums, which were good too.Also, I ordered the Mama's Sangria which was so amazing that I had to ask for a repeat.The Dirty Double Shake was good too. The service was also quick.In all, the place is worth the money."
336,"Mama's Bouy definitely lies in the top five restaurants of GTB Nagar. I went to this place last weeknd and was very much satisfied with all of its aspects be it food, service or ambience. I chose to sit on the rooftop where the smell of hukkah was less annoying.I began with the Drums of Heaven which had an ethereal taste. Then we tried the Chicken Dimsums and the Nachos Bhel. These were satisfactory too. We also the Mama's Special Sangria, which was uniquely refreshing.In all the place was a 9 on 10."

346,"Nice ambi. I would give extra star for the roof top sitting. Good music. The food tasted good. Veg and non Veg category both. if you talk about drinks, one LIIT can give you entire picture. And it was made just perfect. "
347,I had ordered fish for the starters which was really good. But Chicken lasagna and drums of heaven did not go so well. It didn't taste or look like an authentic lasagna and the chicken in drums of heaven was not properly cooked. Even the quantity served is very less.Overall not a good experience. Not worth the price. Will certainly not prefer going there again or refer to someone.
348,"Mama's buoy is of the best restaurant to make memories with good food.Staff service was good,ambience and quality of food was nice.We ordered-In drinks-Oreo shake,Mama's Sangria-both had great taste.In food-drums of heaven and chilli potato.Both had good taste.Pay a visit!U will love it!"

It didn't took much time to serve our order. I liked the taste of the pizza. The base of the pizza was crunchy, which I liked the most. The toppings of the pizza was also delicious. This place is perfect to enjoy delicious food without spending a lot of money. I would love to visit this place again. The people were right about this place, and I noticed that everything they told me about this place was actually true. "
352,The place has a good ambience and terrace sitting is one of the most enjoyable with live music food presentation and quality is good and taste great but the service need to be improved as even on weekday where the crowd was less the service was slow Overall had a good experience
353,"Ordered chicken manchurian, nachos, chicken steak, honey chilly potatoes, pasta, liit and some drinks. Chicken manchurian and potatoes were avg. Could have been tastier. Nachos and pasta were great with a good flavour to it. Steaks were served wid mash potatoes and cheese. I would say its a must try. Absolutely loved the steaks.The place has 2 floors 3rd and terrace. 3rd is an indoor place with good interiors. But the terrace is the place to be where there is a good croud and music playing. All in all good place to spend an evening. "

359,"It has an amazing scene at night especially at the rooftop. We were around 10 people, we ate a lot, drank and partied. The waiter was especially friendly and knowledgeable. The food was very good particularly the fish fingers and the pizza.The desserts are nothing spectacular and I would recommend skipping them. The cocktails aren't fabulous, they need a better bartender in my opinion.But they have an absolutely amazing experience for partying especially in Hudson Lane compared to other places. I would definitely go back to try out more, even if I would have to order plain drinks. "

366,Well it was a very disappointing for us that we planned to visit here for a birthday party..üòïThe service is very poor none of Steward was ready to listen or to offer service on the table. There was dealy in offering the food menu though we got it after 20mins. Then they just want to charge the service tax for their poorest service. I would highly recommend not to go here for any parties. The staff is least bothered to take the ownership or to take responsibilities they just want to pass on blame one another's. 
367,"What a wonderful cafe it is, lovely experience, i tried their signature dish ""sandwich n sandwich"" and this was the best sandwich which i ever ate, their shakes were also good, i tried chocolate oreo and the taste was perfect."
368,"Had a wonderful evening at a wonderful place like mamas buoi, it is most probably the best one when we consider the ambience, food quality was also good, tomato soup can be improved, paneer tikka was very good and so were the shakes. "
369,Nice place with great ambience and decorations .Lovely place for all age groups.Food served here is really good .Both vegetarian and non vegetarian food served here.This place is always filled with University students so they have a large menu for them.Qualityy and quantity both are good and rates are reasonable.This is nearby my place so I visit there occasionally.

It‚Äôs quite difficult to find space here as this place is usually crowded. Services are also fine.Also, there is always some sort of music being played or some celebration going around the place. Be it Sufi night, Dhol night, live singing or just plain loud music. My experience with food here has been great too. I‚Äôve pretty much tried everything from their menu. A few of my favourite food here is Chicken crockets, murg malai tikka, Pizza-e-punjab, keema pao...read more"
380,"Yummy tummy, I must say vibe of this place is altogether different with everything on fleek and yummy tooo.Though Idk why this time the service was quite disappointing but never the less the taste of food was yum. Specially lasagne and formaggi pizza was really good."
381,The best thing about this place is its seating on terrace. The food tastes amazing and so do the beverages. The place is situated in Hudson Lane and very much near to the metro therefore it‚Äôs convenient to travel even from South Delhi.
382,"Cold food. Weird tasting food. Extremely untrained staff. They keep on passing on requests to each other. Good place for getting buzzed on alchocol, but for food, simply cannot beat ricos or Cafe and Co or spezia bistro. Do not recommend."
383,Perfect place to hangout with your friends.I went there for the Christmas and the rooftop had all the vibes to cheer up your holiday mood..
384,One of the best cafe in Gtb Nagar for partying or to hangout with friends. The ambiance is very beautiful and cheering they have rooftop also. Food was good but the drinks were disappointing. Staff was polite and professional. A little bit expensive cafe but worth the price.
385,"This place is just heaven in gtb Nagar, you can't miss the place if you are in north campus. The ambience is LIT and next talking about food and drinks so I liked everything I had here and the menu is vast so you can have several options to try and music in the background is also another thing that I liked here, totally an awesome place"
386,"Mama's Buoi in GTB Nagar is a beautiful place for you and bae to hang out in. Just the fact that it offers a beautiful ambiance in GTB is reason enough for me to take my friends here!The service is extremely quick and friendly. The crowd that comes to Mama's Buoi is zealous and vibrant, just like the place.We ordered the Sangria which was the perfect thirst quencher.But the highlight of the day would have to be thr Melting Moments fried Mozzarella Sticks. Those things of beauty were cheedy, salty and tasty! The perfect appetizer!In conclusion, Mama's Buoi is a nice place for ANY occasion. Try their appetizers for sure. You'll love it.5/5 "

Pizza ..friess.. 3 way chaap... Hookah.. Beer.. thumbs up ..Until next time... Tadaa..

441,"Recently I had a trip to Delhi and heard the name Hudson Lane. So I decided to check it out. I saw so many cafes there but this Mama's buoi caught my attention both by its name and a very lit sign board. Ambience- You enter through a big red door into this place with dim lights and awesome music. The bar section catches one's attention with the shining bottles and colorful drinks.Drinks- The dirty double shake is their signature monstrous shake that takes a load on your appetite. A jar drenched in liquid Chocolate, kept in a bowl of liquid Chocolate is filled with a thick shake topped with two scoops of ice cream and gems. I think it is enough to feel the magical flavor.Appetizers-...read more"

444,"The place looks extremely beautiful in pictures, and from outside as well.But the pictures might disappoint you as the place is way shady. You can even spot a couple having ""their"" time in the corners.But fortunately I chose the terrace to be at. And it was a bad decision all together.The staff is extremely good, no doubt.But it is a place good for booze and hookah and not favourable as casual place to dine and have brunches at.The uniqueness they tried to bring in flavours of food is well quite amazing.Well, if one wants to party and have amazing time, this place is a place you should head forward to, in GTB.(better than any other place for booze and everything)"
445,An amazing place to visit in GTB Nagar. Visited with some of my friends and had a great time. We chose to sit at the roof top. The ambience of the place was amazing!!We tried some of their amazing specials & they were absolutely delicious and yummy. Will visit the place again soon.

Ordered spring roll (‚Çπ209), mix sauce pasta(‚Çπ279) and peach ice tea (‚Çπ125).Ice tea was good except that the glass was so small and that too was filled with 2 huge ice cubes. It hardly had any ice tea in it (finished it in 2 mins still the glass was half full of ice) . This one was no value for money at all.Spring roll was okish for a starter, it came with sweet sour sauce. Asked the waiter 2 times to bring me spicy sauce but they didn't bring even then. Spring roll had very small 8 pieces.Pasta was a huge disappointment. Mix sauce pasta had avg taste, it was sweet in flavor, I had to add lots of oregano to make it little spicy to taste like a real pasta...read more"

486,Highly disappointed! They were supposed to telecast the event (el classico) on Sunday night but they didn't. I called them thrice before coming and confirmed with regard to screening and reservation. But still they had issue with screening. Such unprofessional attitude. The mama's spaghetti pizza veg was terrible too. 
487,"Mama‚Äôs Buoi is the sneak peak centre of attraction in the vicinity of GTB Nagar. This place is so beautifully decorated with its interiors and also with its roof top dine area. The staff is so much soft spoken and the food is next level. I tried fried-chicken burger, chilli chicken, keema pao and finger fish.

I would give a zero star but there is no zero star in zomato app. Never go to this place."

555,"I have visited this place quite a lot of times and the basic reason for me to return is that this place is pocket friendly and they serve fairly decent food and few times are pretty good too. Talking about the last visit I tried their Nachos Bhel Puri, Veg Pink Sauce Pasta, Cheese strips, LIT and X on the beach. The pasta was average could have been better if vegetables were added to it, the Nachos Bhel Puri was a good fusion and good to go as Chakhna but the favorite was the cheese strips, it was expensive but in accordance to the taste, the proce did not matter much. The cocktails were good and had decent amount of alcohol. So, all in all my experience would be Taste: 4/5Price:...read more"

570,"One of worst experience! Very slow service. I ordered dimsum , but felt that it is floating on oil, not good at all. Worst is the dessert as if roti has been mixed with icecream!. Zomato must give option for negative rating.!"
571,"This place is one of my favourite place to hangout with friends. I love their food. ""Chilli chicken"" for me is their signature dish and cheesy ""Garden fresh pizza"" is something everyone must always try. Although I was not happy with ""chicken 65"". In dessert ""Death by chocolate"" is also a must try thing it's super heavy, hard to eat for single person. The quality of fudge is very good. This place is really a worth for money.Taste- 5/5Ambience- 5/5"

So that one feels achievement when they get a seat, forget about food and it's quality!Service is creepingly slow, and they may take a year to present the starter ( forget about entree) ! And on the top of same they will charge 10 % service charge! And they will also give you reasons that why 10% service charge, As if they are sending it Kerala flood victims!Last but not the least , they are very serious about their dessert, which in my case was death by chocolate! It was such a bad idea that I nearly Died, thanks...read more"

We also had innocent girl, fruit punch, mama's sangria mocktails.My personal favourite were the Basil Pasta and the mocktail- Innocent Girl. What was best about the pasta was that it was aptly cooked and the dressing was pleasing to the eye. The taste was sublime and the pasta sauce highly complemented it. Similarly, the mocktail was just perfect. It was neither too sweet nor too bland. It was amazingly refreshing.Coming to the ambience, the...read more"

582,We had a really disappointing experience with this restaurant.We were promised that we will be shown the match on the projector on the topmost floor where they have the open terrace area but that promise was also not fulfilled. The shakes that we ordered was also really disappointing according to the standards of this restaurant. I don't expect this from such good places. Also the service is ‡§¨‡•ã‡§ü up to the mark. The ratings that I have given is only for the ambience. I don't expect this if I ever come back to this place.

At last they let me enter after several request ,cause 4.7 rating is quite tempting.Food is quite good i admit . But humiliation is greater then food.so this my story."

I have tried wine for the first time so i didn't like it muchThe food was delicious and the ambience was great. Apart from this, the place was a bit crowded. I had to wait to find a place to sit.Ambience-10/10Food-9/10Value for money-7/10"
632,"I thought of this place to be one of the most finest property in gtb nagar but in actual its the worst of all. Its a multi level based cafe. The area overall is compromised with a lot of seatings. The staff is really misbehaving and courtesy less. The food on the other hand was more pathetic. We had a margherita pizza which was not at all like margherita but tasted more like a north indian curry.  We had innocent girl and desi in mocktail which again were sour and tasted real bad that we couldn‚Äôt even gulp it down the throat. The desert, brownie with ice cream was so stale that you can actually taste and feel it that how old the food is. "
633,"I loved loved loved the butter chicken balls at Mama‚Äôs boy. They were really crispy and the filling inside was a treat for your taste buds. Served with a gravy on the side which did great justice to the dish! The melting moments cheese sticks came with 3 kinds of dips and were also quite nice. My favourite mocktail was ‚Äòcollege virgin mojito‚Äô which tasted fruity and fresh. The chicken skewers were also good the chicken was quite soft and delicious. The desserts however were a little disappointing the brownie wasn‚Äôt very soft and did not have a good texture. However except the desserts, it was quite a good experience. The decor of the place is fantastic and...read more"
634,"A place I wanted to go again and again reason for it's gud live music and large variety of drinks they serve. I'd ordered French Cosmo. with crispy chilly paneer which was gud some beers and in last had few shots, above all the ambience was gud a bit crowded sometimes so I suggest for previous booking. Overall I enjoyed allot here.( Recommend) for people to love to drink n chill. I rate it 9.5 out of 10."
635,The food was not good in taste we ordered a veg platter and chutney was like green paste of coriander  the service was also very delayed and the area was very small üòî
636,"Good food and booze is something comes in my mind when I talk about this place..!!Starting from starters to the dessert, this place has everything amazing which satisfy your taste buds I had spring rolls, pizza, Chicken tikka, fish fingers and pizza with Oreo shake to pamper myself in the dinner cause they have yummy delicacies and finish it off with the brownie vanilla ice cream which was so soft and mouth watering tooThis is a must try place"
637,This place is known for it's ambience and I hv been here a couple of times with my friends but I don't think everything tastes perfect all the time. Also some improvement is required in mocktails. Sometimes the chicken is soft and juicy n sometimes it's hard.. i dnt know why.. staff is courteous..so overall it's a decent place to hangout..
638,"If you are looking for some good place with good music, ambience and food., this is the place you can opt for..!!I had ordered veg pizza, chocolate Oreo shake, fish finger, chicken tikka which was simply amazing in taste and had enjoyed my dinner with good food and booze..!!Would definitely suggest this place to people who actually wana have good food"
639,"Last Wednesday afternoon i had quite a filling lunch with my best friends. The best part of the meal was Butter Chicken balls which chewy on the inside and cruncy on the outside with a delicious dip to go with it. Honestly, they were so amazing in themseleves that a dip was hardly needed. The chicken skewers i then had were equally good. Laden with a thick coatung of green chutney, the were the perfect amount of spicy i like.We had another appetizer called Cheese melt with were the most perfect Mozerella sticks i've ever had. They were served along with three dips. The mocktails we ordered weren't that great beacause the flavours weren't mixed evenly. As our meal progressed things...read more"

653,"I went to this cafe last night and I must say the place is adorable. The indoor as well as the terrace , both sittings are amazing. You can enjoy your Sheesha on the terrace with your favorite sports because they have a big screen for you and live music.Taking about food , the food was amazing. I ordered variety of things and everything from veg to non veg was delicious. The coffee toblerone shake is a must try and the butter chicken balls where incredible too.My overall experience is good with the place and the service is so fast and I loved it.Next time you plan your night then this place is a must try ."
654,I visited here a few days back.The food was average and the quantity was less.Hukka and lemon ice tea were good.But the nachos bhel puri wasn't up to the mark.Chilly potatoes were good but less in amount. 
655,"This place has emerged and developed to a great place to visit in GTB nagar out of all the cafes. It used to be the most 'not so favorite' place in my list at GTB nagar. But this place has changed the food to an extent that this has become the most favorite place for me at GTB nagar. I visited this place last year,, it has been drastically changed in terms of food and service by now. The ambience has been changed, the music being played was good.¬†The staff is all so courteous. We had a problem with the cold coffee which we made the staff member to get it right. Still they did not utter a word and got it changed thrice. Loved the service and hence got completely satisfied.¬†Coming to...read more"
656,"A very good place to hangout. Hookah is good. Their best part is ambience and their chicken lollipop which is the finest chicken i have ever had. 1 star is deducted because i they are not good at pizza. And if you visit there, you should must try their big ice cream cup and corn salt pepper."
657,"Air conditioner sucks. And it was all too hot while we were here, plus there are no waiters around the table in the corners, so i had to go all the way to the bar twice to place my order and call the waiter."
658,Went here looking at the Zomato Rating. The staff is inconsiderate and the service is very poor. You probably will have to ask for water 3/4 times before you actually get it. HALF of the things on menu were not available. The music was too loud and not at all worth listening. The only good thing were the pita pockets. Would not recommend it to anyone.
659,The dim (no) lighting and smoky atmosphere are there to mask the fact the food's on the verge of going bad. The portions are abysmal and food tastes like it came of a jar and got microwaved. The lasagna was just a table spoon of sauce in a pan. 
660,Nice place to hangout with friends the food was good value for money the atmosphere was good but the air conditioning was low so kindly take care
661,"I tried their Chicken 65 for the starter. It was spicy and nicely cooked, loved it! We ordered Penne pasta in mixed sauce which was again decent. For the drinks we ordered we ordered laughing melon mocktail which was refreshing. "
662,"Mama's Buoi is a great student friendly place which serves almost everything from food to hukkas to cocktails.We ordered- Peri Peri Chicken Tikka, Drums of heaven, chicken Lasagna, butter chicken pizza, Walnut sizzling brownie, Mama's Sangria, Ozzzy jumble and TamarinoThe experience was amazing. The food was top notch. Service was on time and the ambiance is great. Looking forward to coming again."
663,"Mama's Buoi is an amazing lounge located in GTB Nagar, North Campus. It is a student friendly place with a great array of drinks and mouth watering food items.We ordered:1.

Butter chicken pizza- Crust was thin, sauce was amazing, chicken was great.4. Chicken Lasagna- Good Lasagna with minced chicken.5. Walnut sizzling brownie- Best sizzling brownie in town. Hands down.For Mocktails we had- Mama's Sangria, Ozzzy jumble and College virgin Mojito.

664,"the chicken steak and the chicken clear soup is heavenly(only if heaven exists). there is no compromise in the quality and the quantity of the food. well its definitely value for money with a good ambience. this is a good place to have dinner and drinks with family, friends anybody you wanna come with. the only thing i found strange is that the hookah is only available in the terrace and they serve you from 7p.m onwards. make sure you keep that in mind."
665,So i went to this place with my friends and we all just love the ambience. The staff is very polite and and humble. Their service was very quick and promt. 
666,"The place is very well located and a friend and I visited it on an otherwise unoccupied day after browsing through zomato and seeing the ratings. The manager was very sweet as was our server. However, i suspect that the server was fairly new and didn't do well with English which affected my communication with her. She also seemed to have trouble reading the menu which is in English. So i suggest that the management take some time to train the wait staff. Despite these shortcomings, the waitress was exceedingly nice. Coming to the decor, the place also serves hoojah which I don't smoke but for whatever reason, the interiors smelled extremely strongly of citronella oil, the kind of strong...read more"

The place is pocket friendly and is a must visit place. "
682,We had a great time at Mama‚Äôs Buoi. I went with my family after seeing the ratings and this restaurant is amazing. Firstly the ambiance and their hospitality really amazed us we were offered to be seated at the table. We had some scrumptious staters here with fizzzy chilled mocktails. Fried mushroom dahi ke kebab and garden fresh pizza are some must have staters here and laughing melon and fruit punch are amazing mocktails.Amazing experience at Mama‚Äôs BuoiWill visit soon again.

686,"The ambience and staff make it worth the while, however the food was not worth the try. We tried the BB surprise burger which was too spicy for my palate, the fried chicken basket could be served with better dips rather than salsa and sour cream. And lastly the Krems pao which was the saviour of the visit"
687,"As we know Hudson Lane is the paradise for food lovers so I tried this cafe and to be honest it was amazing the food I ordered was Veg platter,dirty double shake, white sauce pasta and Mojito name (Innocent girl)and every thing was just amazing highly recommend also the crowd there is awesome."
688,Food is good.... Guava chilli drink I liked the most.But...Music is so loud. You can't talk.Lights are Dim. Used mobile light to read the menu.Service is slow.Just ok experience.

696,"what i loved the most about this place is the seating arrangement as well as the furniture, its so good plus the food , ofcourse hahaha. loved the pizza."
697,"Honestly overrated. I went here purely based on the ratings and realised I had made a mistake. The drinks were so diluted and quantity of alcohol in cocktails was poor. We ordered Sangria, margarita and cosmopolitan and all tasted nothing like the classic drinks.Now coming to the food, the pasta was HORRIBLE. Worst pasta serving I have had at a restaurant. We ordered the alfredo veg pasta. The quantity was hardly for 2 people and the taste was really bad. The nachos were soggy and salty and the only good thing we had was the butterchicken pizza. All in all, never coming back here again."
698,Quantity is not upto the price . The quality of food can be much better. I loved the desert ( Death by chocolate ) and mocktail ( college virgin mojito). The overall experience was good.
699,One of the best cafe in Hudson Lane. Ambience is good. Food is also good but theere services is late. It takes almost 15 min for 1 dish. I hope they will take care of it.Ambience - 4/5Food - 3.5/5Pocket friendly - 4/5
700,Good place to hangout with friends.. We ordered peri peri chicken tikka and it was worth it.Dance floor is missing at this place. But other than that it is an amazing place.
701,The restaurant doesn't accept bookings without couples on weekends which we found out after visiting the place after travelling 31 km from Chattarpur. Highly disappointed!
702,"One of the finest place in gtb. It has both indoor as well as outdoor seating available. As it was hot outside so we prefer to sit inside. The ambience was lit.

703,"Always standing up to my expectations. Most popular cafe for their quality of food. I tried mix sauce pasta, soya chaap, spring rolls, fish tikka, butter chicken balls, pizza and my most favourite Dirty double shake.

709,It‚Äôs a very very ok place in the university area in gtb nagar they have very average quality of food and have good presentation. These are the things we ordered . 
710,"One of the worst experience I had here. They do not entertain zomato table booking. I had a confirm zomato booking but they denied entry. Next day we tried to call the restaurant and book a table but they told they only take a booking if we are couple or girls only, which is quite odd and disheartening. We wasted our time too. We travelled 30 kms from home just to hear we cannot get a entry.Anyways all the best for the future. It was quite disappointing."
711,"We weent there for a lunch. It‚Äôs an awesome and beautiful place who served delicious food in beautiful ambiance.

They also have live music sessions specifically on Saturday eveningsThe most recommended is their triple layer burger which costs only ‚Çπ250 and very filling.The mozzarella cheese sticks are like a cheesy heaven. They are very creative with their shakes like a chocolate shake topped with butterscotch ice cream is a totally different combination.Must try their BBQ pizza and Keema Pav.A must visit!!
734,"Visited the cafe on a Saturday evening, the cafe has two floors . I went for the open seating of the cafe as the other floor was completely packed.I liked the vibe of the cafe , the outdoor cafe has good number of fans so if you have a thought that you might feel hot then it's not like that.Coming to the food , each and every thing that I tried was amazing.I ordered butter chicken balls , drums of heaven , chilli potato , chilli paneer pizza and lemon mojito.

Music was so loud that waiters couldn‚Äôt hear our order and on top of all this they took service charge!!!!

750,"Yes i heard about it from various sources and decided to give it a try. Firstly lift wasn't working so had to climb 3 floors, then there was no one to seat us and after waiting 10 minutes got seated and again waited for someone to bring menu and water. Ambience is pretty and they maintain male female ratio also , so its good for couples.Beer had no options, had to order goa kings even though i was not interested in it.Pasta and pizza were ordered and only pizza was good , pasta had some different flavour.So its ok and i don't think it lives upto its hype.But do give it a try."
751,This is an amazing place. I went there with my friends. They all loved this place. It has great ambience and is always crowded we had to wait for our order.

The melting moments (cheese sticks) are also worth melting for.The service is also pretty fast."

It's a very economic outlet and also runs some good deals so that it won't feel heavy on your pockets.

It was little annoying..Due to staff and service also the food quality its a perfect place to go..

I was ok with this arrangement so I confirmed the booking. A confirmed table was important for us because my friend's wife is pregnant so we could not make her wait and stand for long.We reached the restaurant 5-10 mins before our reserved time and told their staff on the ground floor about our reservation. Surprisingly our name was not on their list and forcefully they...read more

794,"Visited this place few days back. What i liked most about this place was the ""ambience"". A great place to have some quick bite with your friends or loved ones. With some really refreshing mocktails drinks and also shakes, they also offer hard drinks for those who prefer. Mama's Signature Pizza is a delicacy and a must try. We also ordered veg Lasagne which was loaded with cheese to the max. For all those chocolate lovers out there, a ""death by chocolate"" dessert will satisfy your apetite.Would definitely visit this place again."

802,Went there for Birthday Celebration.. have to wait so long to find a place to sit.. Good atmosphere as ambience is nice and Dj playing good music.. Food is quite delicious with good portion size.. courteous staff.. service is bit slow.. Overall experience was good..! 
803,"The veg platter will get a special mention by me. Its a perfect mixture of different flavours having soya, mushrooms, kebabs and paneer. Even though you might think what can be special about garlic breads but they do justify this dish. I found it very cheesy and full of garlic and olives.The music reaches to its loudest level by the midnight but then that is the demand of the situation. I liked the music how it started with lil soothing ones to the rock songs.Apart from the sitting arrangement and the lil uncomfy chairs everything falls in place very nicely for a typical weekend party.Loved the place!"
804,"This restaurant is not too old, but gained popularity very quicky. As there are many cafes in Hudson lane so its difficult to choose a perfect one, this restaurant is surely the one to choose. From amazing interior to lip smacking food this place have it all.If you are a sports lover you can enjoy your matches along side with some awesome cocktails.i personally recommend you to try their ""Virgin Pinacolada"" and ""Strawberry Sparkler shake"".Ambience and service: Service is very decent but i recommend you not come on weekends as its very crowded you will not get most of it."

Common beer brands not available.Panner Tikka and chicken steak were ok.Dry chicken lollipop and veg seekh kebab.1 plate of caesor salad had 4 plates worth of dressing plus too runny.After these worthless miserable starters we ordered the main course.I can understand butter chicken to be sweet but daal makhani.

In starters Afghani Paneer Tikka, Dahi ke Kabab , big bang theory murg Malai tikka were great . Chicken dimsums and achari paneer Tikka are the must try starters from their menu . I always love to have dessert when i go there . Walnut sizzling brownie and death by chocolate are must have for a sweet tooth ."
820,"So, if there has been less than one star i would prefer that as well.So its for the staff basically.There staff was so rude and ercatic.We planned to visit the cafe at 7:30 PM we went for hookah plus drinks but they just saw there reservation list and told that the table will be provided to you only till 8:30 or 9 and after that u have to leave from here or u have to leave the table and then you have to manage urself So there is no table or preference to the person who is going first.Worst experience and worst staff for being rude attitude as well.

846,"Mama's buoi located on the Hudson lane. This cafe turns out to be one of the happening cafe for me and my friends. This place also serves alcohol along with hukka. Staff was really polite and were on service at every peak of minute.We started our lunch with some shakes and mocktails and their dirty double shake was best amongst all. And continuing our lunch we ordered starters including chicken manchow soup, sandwiches, chilli paneer, cheese pizza, veg dumplings, Butter chicken balls. All dishes were so mouth watering that we got full with starters only.And then we ended our lunch with some desserts like death by chocolate and some hot and delicious brownie.Gonna visit this place again...read more"
847,"In the hub of GTB Nagar, Mama‚Äôs Buoi is the finest among all. With serving the chilled beer, to the yummiest food for a punjabi foodie, this place has all of it. I recently went to this place with my gang. Order tandoori chicken, white sauce pasta, chilli paneer and Chaap. The chaap was not cooked well. Seemed little raw. Rest was well made. "

849,"Mama's Buoi had been on my list for some time. The place can be a little tricky to find because of its being on the third floor of a building a little farther away from the train of other restaurants (or it might be that I am a bit geographically challenged!). They have tried to give the ambience a glam vibe with the space being dark and the music, booming. But at the same time there is enough light that one can see the menu! As I couldn't see a lot beyond my menu, my friend, and the servers, 3.5/5 for the ambience.The servers were polite and patiently explained some of the dishes to us. The service was also prompt. In fact, the owner/manager enquired from every guest if they were...read more"

852,"This place is beautifully located in hudson lane and to be very honest this is one of the best cafe‚Äôs I‚Äôve ever visited in Hudson lane and also this place has rooftop seating also available.This place will provide you a sigh of relief from the crowded places. Once you‚Äôre here, you yourself would see how this place will make you relish every bite of North Indian, Chinese & Continental cuisine at a price that is light on your pocket. The well-organised ambiance decor of the place is no less than amazing and also they‚Äôve really fast service.I would highly recommend this place."
853,"Came here seeing the rating.The food was quite average.We ordered pizza, pasta both being quite bland.Starters were okay.We ordered a shake that wasn't even cold.Hence the rating. "
854,"Nice ambience, sangria was very good, food quality was not good as expected, service standards were ice (quick and familiar) and live performance hits 4 star for their performance.Overall it is nice place to enjoy with friends but u have to go with ladies at the party time otherwise u have to knock somewhere else."
855,Good place with Great Ambience. Great hospitality. Karaoke nights are also there.Keep a check before visiting.Good to go with friends. Food is also good.

857,"3 stars because I expected this place to be better than what I actually experienced. Went today with a friend and ordered Dirty double, strawberry sparklers and grilled chicken. I didn't like the taste of dirty double, it was lil bit salty, don't know why. Strawberry sparklers was perfect, I really loved it. I had high expectations from grilled chicken but it was okayish. I find this place overrated, be it food or ambience. "
858,Excellent ambience and delicious food. Service was promptand enjoyed my time with friends. A must go with yourfriends and family.Must visit here..
859,"So much overrated place, food was not upto the mark as per ratings. Serving room temperature shakes, not satisfied with the service n food. Disappointing place"
860,"Food is good,but the place is bit over hyped.No new concept to get attention.According to the cost of food and liquor,you can get many other good options."
861,"Visited this place for lunch with friends. It has infoor as well as terrace sitting. Indoor sitting is perfect for parties. Terrace sitting was really pretty and perfect to spend time with your loved ones. So we ordered, fruit punch and Mama‚Äôs sangria as drinks. White sauce penne pasta, melting moments, chilli garlic noodles, veg spring roll, lasagne, big bang theory burger, chilli chicken, chicken lollypop, garden fresh pizza, dahi kabab and paneer tikka as starters and main course.

863,"Last week I had a visit to mama's buoi with few friends starting with the very first thing the decor was so classy and the place was crowded with good people.Coming to the food, everything was delicious and the presentation was cherry on the cake all the dishes were very tasty. My recommendations would be mini bunny chow and veg tandoori platter. The drinks I tried were very refreshing. I had virgin mojito and chocolate and mint shake both were equally good. After that we tried some of the desserts, and I loved the sizzling brownie. We also had a visit at the top where beautiful sitting and live music was arranged I found the place very nice I would love to visit this place again!"

868,Mama's Buoi is a perfect place to hangout with friends . Big screen is there to watch FIFA matches while eating your food .We visited this place for a few quick bites . We ordered Chilli garlic noodles and Veg lasagna . Both were delicious . Chilli garlic noodle was one of the best . They perfectly balance the Chilli and garlic taste . Veg lasagna was also good .In drinks Sangria was awesome. For the dessert Vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate brownie was perfect .
869,"The food is good but the bills comes out to be large because of big service charges. I tried the paneer chilly pizza, virgin mojito, peri peri chicken tikka which were really good. I appreciate the quality of food. But it is not advisable for family get togethers because of hukkahs. "
870,"Mama's buoi was on my list from a very long time so finally I decided to visit this restaurant with my friends.

After reaching the place we sat comfortably at the table which was provided to us by the waiter. The waiter Which was allotted to us was rude in the first place as if we are here for free.

879,"After my visit here, i'll happily place Mama's Buoi under my most favourite place list in Hudson Lane. The ambience here is lit with a peppy song list. They have a sit in bar facility as well. Since i visited this place to have dinner, i will focus on talking about the food here. We ordered chilli paneer pizza(all time favourite type), fresh spring rolls, mini bunny chow, veg seekh kebabs and peach ice tea. Among the starters the spring rolls were a little oily but tasted really good, kebabs were tasty too however the mini bunny chow which were small round buns filled with paneer tikka filling were the star dish.

881,"Their burgers were full of oil.Pizza's base was as thin as a papad literally.Only brownie shake was good.Easily one of the worst Cafe in GTB, Don't know how this place is getting so many good reviews"
882,"A place visited by most of the college students after the classes to  try some new dish every day.This place offers all those dishes which are loved by all the children and adults.Moreover, the charges are not too high against the taste and service it offers.Try this place and  do give a feedback.."

The mojito was refreshing and strong. The service was excellent. And after all the eating and drinking we ended up the course with brownie and icecream with chocolate drizzle."
887,"Hudsone Lane is one of the economical places! Mama‚Äôs Buoi gives you a good blend of a place where you can enjoy live music, good ambience and the delicious food! I booked the terrace section for my birthday party! The only problem was it was too hot at the top! However their 3rd floor section is a better option! But if you want to enjoy the live music, you will have to use their terrace section.They also have a photographer who will capture your best pals ‚ù£Ô∏è"
888,"This restaurant was full on a saturday lunch where other cafes were empty. When we entered only two three tables were vaccant. We started our order with their special college mojito which had orange, watermelon and lime juice. It was a perfect to drink to have on a sunny day.Later we tried their Nachose Bhel and Vegetarian Dimsums. I like the idea of serving bhel puri with nachose and it was tasty. Dimsums were just too good. Definately recommendes to order when you go there.We also tried their Arabiatta pasat which was also goodIt was great experience at this place."

The dish was perfectly spiced and tasted wonderful.Chilli garlic noodles: though the quantity was less and the the preparation time was a lot, the dish tasted great.

893,"Visited this cafe for lunch. We ordered a burger, chilli garlic noodles, cheese steak and mojitos. The burger tasted good nothing too delicious or extra ordinary. Chilly garlic noodles were good too. Personally I did not like the steak as there was too much oil present in it. The oil tasted stale kind of and It made the entire mouth oily. Overall a decent cafe but I did not personally feel that it is one of the best out there. There are better options available in GTB Nagar."
894,"So this is one of the most happening places on Hudson Lane....yes!! Mama's Buoi. This place is unique itself. The food, ambience, music and service etc.are perfectly amazing. I would suggest you to book a table on their terrace and go there around 6 pm and so, as you will be able to witness a beautiful sunset with the succulent food. Do try their Mama's Sangria and Crispy chilly paneer. I had an amazing evening there. I hope you to experience the same. Happy Dining. "

909,It was a pathetic experience. The food was pretty average. The soup was quite diluted. They kept mixing up the orders. I ordered veg noodle soup and they got the manchow soup. I did not realize until I had two spoons from it. Then they realized they have placed the other table's food on our table. I expected them to take the soup inside and replace it with a fresh one for the other table. He the guy just took the soup from my table and served the folks on the other table. So unprofessional. I came here based on 4.5 rating on zomato. May be the place is good for parties and drinks but do not come here for good food...
910,"The place is located in the heart of gtb nagar. Vishwavidhyalaya is the nearby metro station. The food is good. I had chilli potatoes which were really nice and crispy. The veg platter and the non veg platter both were okayish. Do try their swiss lindt shake with mint. Loved it. The price is also not very high. Just perfect for the students and those date nights, without burning a hole in ur pocket. Live music is also there. The singer is nice. Loved the experience. The only thing lagging is the service which is quite slow. Hence rated 3/5."

It was a hollowed out bread filled with paneer bhurji and topped with a cheese slice and an olive. Both the cheese slice and olive added lovely flavors to the bunny chow. Could have had another plate The mushroom spinach lasagna was well prepared too. Amongst the drinks I loved their preparation of Mama's Sangria and college virgin mojito. The service was good.

956,A very good place to hangout with friends and party as ambience is very nice and the food is awesome with very nice service . White sauce pasta and spicy chicken dim sums . Will visit again soon.
957,I have read few reviews stating problem with the bill and that is absolutely correct. You'll alwaz find couple of extra items added to you bill. Visited TWICE and happened TWICE!!!!Other than that service depends on the day and time you are visiting. If you are visiting on weekends expect a poor service and it takes long to get food orders. Whereas if its a weekday it is pretty smooth.A decent place to go but never forget to check your bill for item and prices.
958,This place is mostly for party loving people and also for the best pasta and dimsum. I tried there white sauce pasta and spicy chicken dimsum and they were so good. Definitely worth a try.

They have some eccentric wall decor that adds up to your party mood. The place is always buzzing with youth who are here to detoxify themselves of the university burden. Their white sauce pasta is very creamy and cheesy. The mushroom kebabs are succulent. They also serve tiranga chaap which melts in your mouth and the tangy dip just sets the mood. Their freakshake is oozing with calories and cream. That is what I call a perfect insta-worthy beverage to be!Visit this place for a romantic date or a birthday party.

Paneer tikka and Dahi ke kebabs are my all time favourite here.The only downside of this place is it‚Äôs service. The staff is nice but the service is bit slow and they mix your order with others a lot. Otherwise It‚Äôs a decent place and quite pocket friendly too. One of the best options for college students."

The balls were filled by butter chicken & also served with some tasty gravy. The preparation of the butter chicken balls was perfect & the only problem with it was the gravy served with it. The gravy served was cold & I would have preferred a little hot to go with it. Nevertheless try out this delight when next in GTB. Also, the service at the terrace area is TERRIBLE, so anyone visiting this place, try out their sitting area on the 3rd floor."

The cafe has good ambiance with a good interior. They have a wide range of varieties in their menu and the rates are moderate.The quality of food is superb and taste is delicious.We tried:1.Soya tiranga chaap: Presented in the form of 3 layers of chaap of the tiranga colour, it was beautiful in presentation and good in taste.2. Melting Moments: these were cheesy mozarrela sticks and they were good in taste.3. Pad thai: They were flat noodles ,it tasted like tibetan food....it was moderate in taste.4.

993,"Best place at Hudson lane if you are looking for a ""rooftop night""!! I have visited the place two times only but had a good experience at both.They have installed ACs and rotating fans in the open space which make the environment pleasant.The food is also worth the price and some dishes in the menu are uncommon and different.Interiors are beautifully done too.Prior booking is recommended on weekends.Personal favourite yet : Pan fried noodles "
994,"Ambiance: 3.5Food: 3.5Service: 3.5The place is good in an overall perspective. You have the option of sitting in the closed area with dim lighting and not so loud music whereas the other option is the rooftop seating with a bit louder music.One major difference is that they have the smoking area only on the rooftop and hence don't serve hookah in the closed area.The food and service were fine and upto the expectation. However, our main disappointment was the unavailability of all preferred beer brands.Otherwise, the place is good for a casual hangout with friends or family."
995,"This place has sitting in 2 floors...3rd floor is a closed space.. it has a big TV screen.. where they play live matches if there is any. Otherwise that place can also be used for some live music.4th floor is open space...that is used on the basis of weather. If its pleasant outside. You can enjoy yourself in open also. The ambience of this place is amazing.I loved the interior and the menu is at reasonable price...so you can visit here with your frnds and have a good time without burning a hole in your pocket.The service is quick and the quality of food is also supreme.What I had-Dirty double- it was a heavy and Very delicious shake... it had choco chips, brownie, chocolate...read more"

997,"I recently visited Mama's buoi with my friends. I heard lot about it , so we thought to give it a try!The ambience is great. This place serves different cuisines. The thing we ordered we -Penne pasta-Tandoori non veg platter-Cosmopolitan-LIITThe service is good and sound. Light music is always plugged in. They can customise your drink. The non veg was very tender. The penne pasta was very creamy and good that we ordered it twice!The overall experience was very satisfying.If you are in north delhi then it's a must try. I'm sure you won't regret. I highly recommend Mama's buoi. :)"
998,My brother had been raving about this place for ages as its his favourite hangout joint so on his insistence I too went last week. Wasn't disappointed.The airconditioned area on the 3rd fl.had live sufi music playing. We sat on the terrace which is beautifully done up with live band playing. Being a Saturday it was jam packed .Surprisingly we could not feel the April heat as there were fans and mist being sprayed . I noticed there were people of all age groups .......1 yr. ++++Waiters were quick on their feet.....food was great.....the owners were there all the while to keep a check .Superb !!! Do visit ! Worth going !!!
999,Today I went to Mama's buoi GTB nagar for lunch their atmosphere was quite chilled out and refreshing. Food was delicious especially veg tandoori platter paneer tikka and soya chaap especially! Pan Thai was authentic and unique which I  experienced it for the first time also shakes were tasty. Virgin mojito was classic that I enjoyed it the most üòÅ and in desserts walnut brownie sizzler with vanilla ice cream    it was mouthwatering and yummy üòç
1000,Gtb nagar is one of best places in Delhi for hangout so my foodie mind was searching for a nice decent cafe and I found mama's buio cafe it is a rooftop cafe with so cool and refreshing ambience . Food was great especially Pan Thai and veg platter which was delicious and authentic in its taste. Also virgin mojito and shakes were classic and tasty. What I loved the most was walnut brownie sizzler with vanilla ice cream it was mouthwatering and yummy üòç

1002,"North Delhi or any other part of Delhi except South isn't my cup of tea. Yes, I am a South Delhi snob!Mama's Buoi happened on a hungry, hot afternoon and I was pleasantly surprised by the sheer size of this place. I expected to enter a dingy place but it was the exact opposite. Beautiful interiors and a central bar, comfy high chairs and sofa seating and my absolute favorite- A Bar Display wall. It had everything from Monkey Shoulder to Glenlivit and I couldn't stop drooling a it.Here's what I had and fell in love with:Veg Cigar Rolls- Crunchy and Non oily on the outside, the multiple layers of the sheet had me doing a happy dance in my head and the filling was generous and...read more"
1003,Liked the food taste and the ambience. I will surely recommend this to my FnF. Parking could trouble foodies as you will hv to park your car on road. Rest all good.
1004,"Food is good. But due to lack of space ,sitting and bar area are somewhat mixed with each other which is not so good sometimes when you are with family"
1005,The ambience is beautiful and so is the food. The top floor is my favorite with light water shower at intervals and Music.INR 1000 approx for two.
1006,Mama's buoi is one of those caf√©s that stand out of all the caf√©s opened in this area and there are a lot of caf√©s in this area so this means something. We have been to this place thrice and have never been disappointed with the food or service.The ambience of the place is of a cafe bar with a great roof top (would recommend that only for the cooler months). They have a great playlist which is sure to make you sway.The service is great they make you feel like you are getting personal attention and they would be happy to customise your order as you like.What food/drinks we recommend:Chicken skewersChicken tikkaMama's signature izzaRustic chickenDrinks - Indian spices margarita...read more

1008,Please don‚Äôt visit if you want to drink. They serve very diluted drinks and charge too much for such service! Food was good but slow service. 
1009,"Mama's Buoi Cafe is a place where you can enjoy every bite of North Indian, Chinese, and Continental cuisines. The decent decor of the place is no less than amazing. The staff here is efficient. It's a n ideal place for someone who is looking to spend less and get a lot in return. The rooftop an the outdoor ambiance is a cherry on top for diners. They also offer Hookah and alcohol.¬†I went here with my son and had a decent lunch. Thin crust Garden Fresh Pizza, Pan Fried Noodles, Apple Sangria and The oh so yummy Death by chocolate.¬†Would 10\10 come here again."
1010,"A paradise for Party Animals who love their food. There are probably 50+ cafes in Hudson Lane but this one surely stands out. They don't have any fancy looking desserts on their menu nor do they have an alfresco look to the ambiance but still It's the most popular place in North Campus only because they're doing the basics right. They have a terrace which probably no one is going to use in this hot weather but sure comes in really handy in the winters. The indoors attract most of the crowd because of the loud music, good booze, shady ambiance and of course the big projector where one can watch the over-hyped IPL with a bottle of beer in one hand and a slice of pizza in other.

1011,Food and service is good like the whole feel and ambience of the place but there are 2 main shortcomings1 they only have hooka on the terrace top2 they have the worst LIIT drink I have ever tasted it tasted like shit pls nvr ever try the liit 
1012,Place was good. Service was ok. Many options in the menu was not available. All over experience was OK. One time visit place. Review given from the point of view of vegetarian.

1014,The most happening place of North Delhi visited till now . Mamas‚Äôs Buoii is located in between the food hub of north delhi i.e Hudson Lane and I can say that its the best among all .

The appetisers are excellent. I have never tried their main course because the appetisers are so fulfilling. The must try dishes are mushroom tikka, tiranga chaap, white sauce pasta and dirty double shake. "
1021,"We went there for a light snack, the place has a great terrace, with live music as well, a great. Party place for the night. The service was abit slow but the food was worth it.

1025,"Heard a lot about this place was even excited to visit but it failed to live up to the expectations be it the place itself or the food. Ordered mushroom tikka and mojito, Mushroom tikka was d worst i have ever had anywhere. Now coming down the place itself it's so small in area dat it ends as soon as it starts. I do not recommend this place. "
1026,The first rooftop lounge in the place. Has amazing drums of heaven. Chilly potato is good to taste. Service charge is additionally taken by the lounge. But then it compensates with the quality of food they provide you.‚ù§Ô∏è
1027,"the place is located in hudson lane, gtb nagar. they have a good variety of shakes, pizzas, and other stuff.the prices of this place is quite expensive for a normal guy, who just wants to enjoy his day with some friends.the quality was very good, ambience was awesome.and i am really impressed by their presentation of food.overall it is the place where you can enjoy with your friends, only if you have enough in your pocket."
1028,"Honestly i so feel this one is a overhyped place. I had mixed experience here, can really say because first, it was quite crowded that day, two, we were served cold food. Service was pathetic as no one changed the food, thankfully got a table and paid so much for disappointment. Pizza was weird. Only thing i liked was this drink whose name i don‚Äôt even remember. Sorry but i had a bad experience."

Just walking distance from gtb nagar metro station.Visited here with friends in evening, they have indoor as well as outdoor seating area also.¬†Interiors was nice and ambience was cool.Food was just average, had pizza¬† and pasta. Service can be also better.Overall value for money place."
1030,"Settling for a Mama‚Äôs boy, not so bad afterall. In matters of love and marriage, I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder, how much are we willing to accept or overlook just because it dawned upon us that being alone is no less than a terrorism spread by exceeding age brackets and the time is flying away like the falcon. In accordance to that we have now started acknowledging the materialistic as materialistic. Enmeshed, scared little unhappy, passively aggressive personalities who‚Äôs mothers walk in unannounced as heroic superwomen saviours, that were once used as phrases of embarrassment are now accepted for a peaceful coexistence considering ones slim chances.

But as I mentioned, the place is super busy so it‚Äôs obvious to have a compro on the quality of service. We sat on higher platform of the rooftop. The ambiance is amazing. The live music actually starts between 9:45-10:00 and not at 9:00 p.m. as they say.Talking about the food and beverages. It‚Äôs A1 since day1. Thankfully they haven‚Äôt compromised on food.

1033,Visited this place on my birthday with my friends and the experience was quite nice. The pizza was good and the alfredo pasta was delicious. naachos tasted great! Not a fan of the mezze platter but it was all well presented and nice.

1035,"I had checked this place online and wanted to go there for quite some time. I finally went there yesterday and god, I so wish I hadn't. Thoroughly disappointing restaurant. There were a number of issues that I faced:- Quality of Food: Just about average, there is nothing great about quality or taste.Price: For a restaurant in Hudson's Lane, which is known for it's pocket friendly restaurants, this one is an exception. Quiet steeply priced for the quality and variety of food they offer- Ambience: We sat indoors, and had requested for a place on the roof top. For 2-3 hours that we sat there, they couldn't shift us upstairs. The air-conditioning was not working and despite our several...read more"
1036,"i went to the cafe with a group of friends and we ordered handsome amount of food; dirty double shake, mama's signature pizza, mixed grilled sizzlers veg, jalapeno toast and fried rice.the kebabs in the sizzlers platter were simply mind blowing. jalapeno toast could have used some more flavor to it. fried rice up to the par. and who could ever go wrong with pizza!? it was extremely delicious!but most of all, my heart was taken away by the dirty double chocolate shake! just the perfect amount of chocolaty and sweet!I was pretty much impressed by the quantity and quality of the food.plus, the ambience of the place is delightful. especially late musical nights, which are soothing."
1037,The place has both indoor and outdoor seating available and i prefer outdoor as it‚Äôs better than sitting indoor here!! The place has live singing and alcohol with good food!! A must visit place
1038,Great place for a weekend hangout! Food is great for the price! It's location is not pretty cool but don't miss the terrace view of the North Campus DU!
1039,I am sure u will fall in love with this place a pleasant environment to hang out with your friends n loved ones.. with goodservices n good food must try mama's buoi signature pizza n shakes....
1040,"Worst place would never recommend to anyone. They don‚Äôt know how to take proper reservations, quite unprofessional. They take reservation for terrace and make you sit downstairs after waiting for an hour. Manager is even not aware of what is happening in the restaurant."
1041,This cafe is perfect to go when looking for a hangout place with your friends! The food over here is quite delicious and the ambience is kind of LIT but what makes it down is the music chart they play! I ordered:Dirty double shake-the best thing I ordered Mozeralla cheese sticks- Little overrated4 cheese pizza- Crunchy and crispy Alfredo pasta- Okayishh Spring rolls- very crispy and tasted pretty decent Overall I would recommend the place at least once :)
1042,really very good food good ambiance and drinks also very very good we order butter chicken ball .mamas signature pizza and dirty double .. everything up to mark and guyes meet with kailash rawat very polite and fast server .carry on guyes .....do rockkkkkk....

1044,"worst food ever..sorry to say,,we ordered 1. dahi kebab that was ok types then 2. schezwan noodles quantity was so less and it's nowhere taste like schezwan then 3. manchurian and fried rice..in the name of fried rice they gave white rice and some veggies in it and manchurian was pathetic.. but the rooftop area was good that's the only thing I liked,,and staff was not friendly at all.."
1045,i absolutely enjoyed the food and the ambience.The food was absolutely wonderful from preparation to presentation very pleasing. The service was very good the waiter (ajit) was attentive and made sure that the food was to our satisfaction
1046,I cannot complain about the food. It was nothing exceptional but it wasn‚Äôt bad. I enjoyed it. However the service? It‚Äôs extremely bad and the staff is just laid back. They just don‚Äôt care and have no sense of customer service. Don‚Äôt over crowd your place for the sake of money if you cannot provide the service to your customers. 
1047,"This is one of my fav. Restaurent in north Delhi. I visited here many times, but never get bored to visit here. Place with awesome interior, music, drinks and food. Service staff is very helpful and pleasant. The managers are always there to attend you. However the place is crowded all the time. The best part is that place is quite economical and doesn‚Äôt burn hole in your pocket while enjoying drinks. "

1050,Mamas Buio is a nice restaurant located in GTB Nagar where you can find so may restaurants line by line. Butter chicken pizza and sagria is good but the service was unfriendly. All in good place.
1051,"Recently visited the place, easy access. Went with a friend after thoroughly reading the ratings and reviews. The ambiance in the indoor seating was good but too dim so decided to sit on the rooftop, though i hate smoke but still managed to sit in the outdoor so that i can at least see my food.The staff was okay, the waiter was unable to hear the order properly because of the loud music, so it is suggested to keep it on a reasonable volume so that people can communicate.Coming to the food, so we were just two people so did not order much.

1052,"Visited this place with couple of friends and the experience was really bad. Talking about food, we ordered dirty double shake, white sauce penne pasta and pan fried noodles. Shake and pasta was just fine but the noodles spoiled the entire mood, it was half burnt and half uncooked, we felt like puking just after having our first bite. Coming to the ambience, it was ambrosial but then again the staff was rude and ignorant. Would not recommend it to anyone."
1053,"One of the very few places in the area with valet parking service which was good. Interiors aren‚Äôt that appealing, the couches and chairs are demanding new life. Also they have cramped up the place with tables everywhere so as to accommodate more people. We had ordered chilli paneer, noodles and veg salt pepper. Taste was reasonably good but the biggest disappointment was that AC wasn‚Äôt working. It started getting hotter by the minute so eventually we had to leave early. "
1054,They are just ok. Nothing as per the hype. We tried Appletini in cocktail which only had lemon üëé....their pizza and main course was decent. The dessert brownie with ice cream was the biggest disappointment as the brownie was very hard. We got it replaced but still the same. I would not recommend it to others üëéüëéüëé
1055,Very Poor service! had to wait 1 hour only for a burger and the fries were also over fried! if you are looking for a place with good service and food please don't visit mamas buoi . you can try cafeteria and co. it's a nice place.
1056,Amazing food nd good service;would definitely recommend to try their dishes(especially pizza and chilly potato).They also gave us a complementary mocktailüòç
1057,"I had heard so much about this place and without any plans we went there hoping it would be as heard, but to our disappointment it was nothing of that sort. We ordered a vegetarian platter , a coffee toblerone shake and sangria and to my surprise nothing as much the hype and praises for this place . For the ambience that too was not something I would give marks for . I would just like to conclude that this place in Hudson is not what it projects and yes this place in NOT FOR VEGETARIANS . "

1065,I have visited lots of restaurants in the area but this one by far hits the spot everytime.Consistent and fresh made to order. The food is always good and the service is second to none.The prices are reasonable too.
1066,The terrace sitting is lovely. One can enjoy there with friends on an evening getaway in a pleasant weather. The food was decent and music was good. You can give it a try!!

1071,"Was here for my birthday celebration last night and the place made it memorable. Right from the food to the ambience to the service everything is great! The best part was the live band performance. Keep up the good work, Mama's Buoi!"
1072,Visited this place recently. Had heard a ton of amazing reviews from people. The food was great. We ordered paneer tikka and pasta here. Both of them were great.. Would love to revisit and try some more food from here. 
1073,"ambience was perfect, food was tasty and well decorated, but service was slow. to get our bill we have to wait for an half an hour.but everything was perfect and music was amazing.must recommened to visit once."
1074,Good food. Amazing Music and special mention for the courteous staff -Junaid. The live band is the cherry on cake.  Best Live Music place in North-west delhi .Coming back soonüòä

1076,"The ambience is good n the seating is nice.. other than that, the food quality is just average. One of the good restaurant in Hudson Lane but nothing special.. the food which we ordered was served cold, especially the chilly potato, it was hard too. "
1077,"The place is situated near North Campus and has an amazing ambiance. The interiors too are amazing. The food served was well presented and tasted good. The service too was quick and nice. The quality and quantity of the food was up to the mark. The chicken tikka pizza, chicken lasagne, fried chicken and sweet corn soup are a must try. The place is must try."
1078,My favourite from GTB Nagar. The food is the best here. A little bit seating issues. The deck is the part it got. And the service is also amazing and fast. One should visit often.
1079,"I visited here 4-5 times. Suggestion for everyone before going Mama‚Äôs Buoi, please make a advance table booking specially on Saturday and Sunday. Food is delicious Staff is polite Prices are ok ok"
1080,Beautiful restaurant with great service & amazing food.Had the butter chicken pizza & pan fried noodles. Both were very nice.Highly recommend..
1081,This cafe is located at the edge of Hudson lane. The ambiance is nice. They serve good continental food and excellent shakes and mocktails. Their brownie shake is too good and overflowing with ice cream. Sangria is also good.Spring rolls and butter chicken pizza are also good. Loved their fruit sundae as well. Do try.
1082,"Nice ambience, soothing environment, good music, good  crowd and food is awesome!!! Must visit place and definitely gonna come back here!!!Staff: Junaidüëç"

Coming to the look and ambience of this place , it‚Äôs quite fascinating and way look better than you might think ....... ordered chilli potatoes , white sauce penne pasta , mamas special pizza with Virgin Mojito and ice tea .... must tell you that chilli potato and white sauce pasta was yummilicious and the pizza was fabulous ..... the ambience and decor was outstanding ......."
1085,"Worst experience!! Staff is not at all courteous!food we ordered was galouti kebab,peri peri chicken tikka,chilli chicken,hummus pita which was just average.the problem we got was the a/c dont work on the rooftop. The next thing what happened will shock u all..one of the staff member said we‚Äôll switch on the fan.as soon as they switch it on the front part of the fan (metallic cover) came straight towards my face!

1086,A perfect place for hang out. The terrace part is really appreciable with the live music and the ambience. The food quality is great. It is better to book it prior as it is fully packed always. 
1087,I have bee here in GTB nagar most of the times and have tried diffrent cafes and this time I tried Muma's Buo. The service was not upto the mark because it was very much crowdy at that point of day.The food was okayish type but the decor and ambience is good and will try next time to get good results
1088,"Came here with a friend for dinner and had Honey Chilli potato and Garden Fresh Pizza. Both the items were delicious. The ambience was good , I should say much better than what we expected when we saw the restaurant from outside."
1089,Good ambience. Food was delicious. Service was a bit delayed and not up to the mark. All and all it was a good dining experience with friends and family
1090,"One of the best places to visit in Hudson Lane (probably the best) is Mama‚Äôs Buoi, serving delectable food and impressive experience overall. The live music adds on to the beauty of this place! *Cheers*"
1091,Nights at Mama‚Äôs Buoi with the live bands are amazingly fun. Better hookah flavours to be preferred though. Food is average too. The presentation is unbeatable. 
1092,"Average food and ambience.Went on sunday evening. Took seating on terrace. We got the table as soon as some guests left but the staff didnt even come clean the mess. I had to ask them to atleast pick the leftover cutlery and hookah. And shockingly only those things were picked up. The table was not cleaned and neither the dirty tissues and nick picks were picked from the floor. Very dirtyIn food we ordered1) rage bull LIIT- poor taste, it tasted like khatta nimbu pani . No taste of alcohol. When asked to change they added more redbull. Not rexommended.

1093,best place!!went with my friends for birthday.The food is really good. The best part of the place is the terrace area. Staff is  very humble and nice! ambience perfect!loved the death by choclate and chilli mushrooms.. although a music was dull at our time so hope for a good music next time

1097,Visited them yesterday and found this place amazing.     We ordered non veg plater which has  hi ken seekh mutton seekh chicken tikka and fish. All were amazing.  Some punjabi chicken pizza was just ok. Kind of soggy less toppings and very less cheese. Honey   chicken shredded was way too sweet inspite of telling him we want it with very less honey. Chicken malai tikka has more salt on it. Veg mamas boi pizza was gud. Salt n peper was also gud. Nachos cheese were soggy and lacked flavours. Hokkah are gud but 1000 plus taxes is way too costly.   CHilli honey potato wdre gud. Pasta white sauce was undercooked and has no veggies. Liquor they say they serve on nominal prices but they serve...read more
1098,Mama‚Äôs Buoi have some great food in their menu. Ambience is also quite good. Their burger was exotic in every bite. It was quite a good experience.
1099,I booked a table for evening at call but the receptionist denied my booking .I waited for 1 hour and his behaviour was so rude . Highly unsatisfied!
1100,Mama's Buoi has a very lively vibe.It's the perfect place to have small get togethers in GTB nagar and is not too crowded either. They even have outdoor seating (perfect for hosting small parties). Food is fine but the service is slow(especially when you are sitting outside)Availability of valet parking gives you one more reason to check out Mama's Buoi !!
1101,"It's was our wedding anniversary and I'm repenting on my decision to try this over hyped place. There was nothing special. We ordered starter as paneer Tikka achari & it was pathetic full of salt, vegetables weren't marinated properly, mint sauce was worst than road side pakora stall. The most annoying thing was the music. It was so loud and meaning less tracks were there. Staff was good and humble. Not recommended place for families especially. "
1102,Ordered veg pizza and mix sauce pasta and it was very pathetic like never had such a bad food at a place who has good ambience. It was very far away from what I expected. 9999987644 
1103,superb fantastic place very welcoming staff as my friend suggest place turn out the same. the entrance is not so eye catchy but experience is itself one of its kind. service specially given by prithvi was so attentive though beverages specially mama's sangria was excellent. must go place at Hudson Lane. cheers guys
1104,Very good service by vinod chanoli Great ambience Music was also great Overall a good experience Food was delicious I will recommend this restaurant for sure
1105,The atmosphere here is very much applaudable as well the food here is quite admirable. The songs here makes up the taste of food more delicious and the terrace dining in a good climate conditions makes up the moment memorable.
1106,Worst behavior by the staff ever. He was continuously staring at my friend after changing our place he was still on his attitude. And the unneeded charge service charge which is optional on the point of customer and when we asked about this to staff he started to argue. Food quality was not that good Would not recommend this cafe to my friends on future basis üò°üò°
1107,"Great service and cordial staff, we ordered Chilli Paneer Quesidillas and Chicken kebab. The kebabs were great and the Quesidillas were about satisfactory. However, Virgin Mojito was a blessing to have! "
1108,I recently went their with my family and my kiddo. We opted for a terrace sitting as we wanted to enjoy sheesha. It was a Sify night and the singer was playing some real good music. I heard a lot about this place but to be honest I didn‚Äôt find this place extraordinary. It‚Äôs normal restaurant which may have been hyped a lot. We ordered for mock tails which were too sweet to finish. We had a veg pizza too and a mushroom starter both were ok but not outstanding.
1109,Services was good. Food was quite delicious. Enjoyed the meal and music.. Babaaaa was entertaining and very funlovibg guy.. served realy good.. that guy is amazing!!! 
1110,Food iz good...  The service too..  We were served by Parwez Alam and he served us well..  The service is fast and quick.. Di try the Mama's Sangria whuch is really good...

1112,Vinod chamoli was quite good at his service and food and drinks services were quite good. Had a pretty good time here . The only thing was music wasnt playing in the facility.

1115,"I am completely in love with the interior of this place. It‚Äôs so pretty. Also the food tasted so good that I can visit this place again, without thinking. Order chilli pizza(if I remember the name correctly), pasta and chilli potato. Chilli potato tasted the best though. But the other dishes were good as well. Was happy to be there, the place proved to be as good as I heard it to be. "
1116,Poor service. We waited for about 25 minutes for the menu card to arrive. The food was half cooked. You could smell mustard all over it. Three of my friends got food poisoning. 
1117,"I went on Sunday night for dinner with my friends and the place was jam packed. It took more than half an hour to get a seat over the terrace. There are two floors, one is enclosed and the other one is a terrace (the happening one) and both had live performances going on. The environment was pretty lit, everyone was enjoying and getting drunk.Service however, was not pleasing. We had to place food and drinks order 3-4 times as due to miscommunication and seating problem it got cancelled again and again. After more than an hour we got the drinks and sheesha. Our cocktails had no alcohol at all. They were basically mocktails with cocktails price. We had red wine sangria, cosmopolitan and...read more"
1118,This place has really good¬† food.  It is very flavourful and I haven't tried anything I have not enjoyed. I was a bit skeptical on my first visit because of the mixed reviews but this place surprised me.
1119,Delicious foodNice presentationWide range of menuAmbience is perfectDivided in few sectionsGives pure look of European cafeTeamAmanjourneymen
1120,"Well, where should I start from. Ambience was good and staff was very cooperative and nice. The food though, is below average. We ordered pan fried noodles, non veg tandoori platter, fried chicken basket, dirty double shake and coffee toblerone shake. First we received our shakes. Coffee toblerone was only cold coffee. Dirty double was just fine. Pan fried noodles were nice. But our non veg tandoori platter was cold, flavors were good though. And we found a strand of hair in our fried chicken. In the end they didn't charge us for the fried chicken, and gave us complimentary dessert as a token of apology. Kind of a disappointment. read more"
1121,"Last Tuesday I celebrate my birthday at mama‚Äôs buoi ambience is good but pay for food not for ambience,food was tasteless totally waste of money Dal makhni they served without salt and peri peri chicken is like raguler chicken tikka chili paneer is totally tasteless i waste my money at mama buoi I never recommend this restaurant "
1122,Nice place with nice musical nights and tasty food. Aura is good and service is the best. A bit out of budget sometimes but worth it. Go and checkout this place once atleast.
1123,it was a fine experience.ambience and service were good.the seating space was pretty lavish.and pizza and pasta was kinda okayish.the highlight were the desserts. a must try.
1124,"I celebrated my birthday here. Their hokkah is too good. Although food needs little improvement. But their service is absolutely good. Also, this is one of the biggest, and the most crowded place in hudson lane. And the fame of this place is totally worth it. ‚úî‚ù£"
1125,"A must place to visit with friends. Firstly, the ambiance is very nice. The rooftop is very beautiful. We ordered many dishes and each and every dish was very tasty and delicious. One should must to this place."
1126,"This Mama's buoi at hudson lane is a place where no one tells about your experience to your mama. You can always try to find a place when they have a live gig around. The music is absolutely amazing. Talking about the food, i personally found a home made taste in all the different types of cuisines i tasted. Everyone has got something or the other for their fill. So, dont tell your mama and visit this amazing gem in  the delhi university area, north delhi. "
1127,"Lovely ambience, nice n friendly staff, food's simply awesome , non veg's n mocktails a must try here ,outdoor seating comparatively better .  "
1128,Found this amazingly beautiful cafe in Hudson Lane. Music and ambiance was good. I tried a few things from their menu. Veg Tandoori platter is highly recommended. The Alfredo Pasta was done well. The shakes were good. Also the staff was pretty courteous. 
1129,"If u want to have great time with your friends and family in Hudson lane...u got one of the best place as mama's buoi..u should try their fish fingers, pan fried noodles , murg Malai tikka, dirty double shake, coffee and toberlone, and most of them Rogan gosh...every dish was beyond expectation and palatable ending with royal chocolate as fine desert..ambience is also luring with live music to satiate you and have great time.service is quick from Kailash rawat and the place is affordable being in student zone...love to visit again and again."

1133,"Located in Hudson Lane, the place caters to a lot of student crowd and the prices are quite reasonable. They have indoor seating as well as a nice terrace. The lights were quite dim and was very dark indoors hence we decided to sit on the terrace. The terrace is beautiful, open and spacious. Coming to the food we wanted to try something different and asked the staff for their speciality but all they could suggest was pizza's, burgers and the mezze platter.¬†We ended up ordering the bread and sticks with dip and Lamb Steak.¬† The bread and sticks are basically mozarella cheese sticks came with 3 types of dips.

1134,Food is good ..I only tasted burger so ...it‚Äôs ok for me but ‚Äú the buns need to be  a little slim ; it was thick which kinda takes the taste of the patty ...over all good!! And about dinning white plates will be better then uneven coloured plates .!!
1135,The food quality is not upto the mark as well uncooked pasta and not fresh fish and the quality of cooking is not up to any quality. Paneer is of very bad quality 
1136,"The ambience is good, the background music and everything is just fine. It was quite hard to find the place since the building was under construction, you'd have to ask your way in. It's on the third floor. We were on their second roof top not the top most. Sat next to their stage. Our experience was not good. Not at all satisfied with the cafe. The staff was not responsive.What we tried:üí• Mama's Sangria - it was good.üí•Virgin mojito- okayish.üí•Coffee & Toblerone- not good at all, tasted more like frappe and no Toblerone.üí• Mama's signature pizza: not good at all.üí• Dirty double- good.üí•chili/honey chilli potato: very bad.PS: I'm not going to include the pictures of...read more"

1139,The most happening place in Husdon Lane is Mamas Boui currently.Its almost at the end of the Lane on the 3rd floor. It has a beautiful terrace and a inner sitting area. The food served here is very delicious. We tried here Penne Arabiata and Cheese Cigars. Both the dishes were upto the mark. Their pizzas and Mughlai is extremely delicious. The pasta was mindblowing. The service is quick but weekends are mostly jam packed as this place has live singing on the rooftop. We would rate this place a 4/5 for there amazing food and a fantastic live singing night!

1144,"Mama's buoi is one of the best restaurants in hudson lane. A little expensive as compared to other restaurants in hudson lane but once you see the ambience, it all seems legit. Along with the dim lit area, it also has the best rooftop of campus to feel the winter breeze. Tandoori non veg platter and fish fingers are a must try if you visit this place. Only drawback is the slow service."

1147,Worst service ever ! Delayed every time we ordered something. Most of the things listed in menu were not available. Then what's the point to put them in menu ? 
1148,"We went here to celebrate our friend' birthday. There are 3 levels of seating at the place. We first sat in the indoor seating area but then shifted to the topmost rooftop seating area. The music playing was very okayish. The food was really tasty. We ordered dahi kebabs, chilli chicken, honey chilli potato, pizzas and beers were reasonably priced. Everything was really well prepared. But the hookah was very expensive for a price of ‚Çπ1000 + taxes. Overall, a good experience but I've been to comparatively a bit higher prices than other cafes in GTB Nagar."

1150,"Average place. The food was okayish, Service was really really slow. We shifted to the roof dining and the waiters were least bothered to serve food. Rather they were chit- chatting among themselves. He mistakenly served us tandoori fish whereas we ordered tandoori chicken. And when he replaced the order, the quantity served was very less. As we had already consumed 3-4 pieces so he intentionally bought few pieces of chicken! That was really low of him! The waiter also served the cake first but he was told to serve it at the end as sweet dish! Careless attitude of waiters.Butter chicken pizza was good ! Shakes were average.

Value for money: for college students the food is reasonable. But the shakes seemed a bit over-priced, tasty nonetheless.Ambience: call yet peppy ambience. Fun for groups and couples. Good view.Service: a little slow, but the servers were friendly and helpful.Recommendations: try their red sauce chicken pasta, and Dirty double shake. "

It was cold on rooftop but The Burning flame they kept as design was actually working to warm us which is in my opinion Quite Innovative.Pricing is moderate. Chinese is really tasty. White sauce paste was average. Chicken tikka was brilliant. Chili potato was good. But pizza didn't impress us. Overall spicy food is quite tasty (Spicy doesn't mean bitter) Would I be visiting there again?Definitely. Absolutely loved the place and would be visiting soon.Management should work on Beer Buckets.

Rest of things were good and filling. "

1158,A Nice Lounge on the busy lanes of GTB Nagar which usually consists of only Cafe‚Äôs and restaurants mainly. I happened to be here on a Saturday night and got a table reserved on their terrace.There was a brilliant Sufi band performing there. They usually hosts Sufi Nights twice or thrice a week. Food was brilliant no issues. Menu is nicely priced and also Alcohol is served at a affordable price. Overall had a great experience.

Onions could have been better though.Oreo shake is normal like you make at home so need to spend 190 on that!Total bill was 780. A lil overpriced for college but good experience!Service was fast! Ambience is good. They have terrace too which is great for winters! "
1166,"Hudson lane is a hub of cafes where you can hangout  and spend quality time with your friends. Mama's buoi is one of them. It is 3 storey building and also have open roof top seating.They are offering north indian, continental and Italian cuisine. Ambience was decent. We ordered caesar salad, alfredo pasta and dahi kebab. I don't like the salad .. seasoning of the salad was bad and it only contains lettuce and bread pieces. I like dahi kebab the most .. so soft and melted in my mouth. The way they present their food was perfect and different from others.So here is the rating: Taste - 3.5/5Ambience - 4/5Staff - 4/5Presentation - 3.5/5Value for money  - 3.5/5 "
1167,"""Mama's Buoi"" - The Best place in Hudson lane for having a party. Food is as always tasty and serving is good no doubt. With live music and with good ambience especially the terrace makes this a place the best one in Hudson. "
1168,"Mama‚Äôs Buoi is situated among the hub of hudson cafes.The perfect place to party and chill out with friends.Ambience good,food good and friendly staff .....what else one needs.weekends is live music which adds to the charm of the place.will definitely visit again ...."
1169,Some places in Delhi are overly hyped I think....it's a nice place to have a drink and eat with your friends but nothing exotic about it.......the ambience was good I can say but the seating  was quite conjusted.. nevertheless the food was good or I can say I was satisfied but according to the hype created it was not upto the mark.... rooftop area was also good.....all I can say is a nice place to have fun with friends
1170,"Drinks were good. Good food too. But they should probably lose the live musician. As great as he was, not the type of musician or music I want for a Saturday night!"
1171,Great ambience to enjoy with freinds. The mocktails were really different from other places and a delight to drink. The food was yum... a great place to visit again.
1172,Mama's Buoi is one of the best place to hang out in hudson lane. It offer you roof top too. Roof top was perfectly maintained. It could accommodate a lot of people. You would really enjoy while sitting there. Now lets talk about the food. The food from non-veg to veg was very good. There was some of the things that i didn't like. But improvement was made to the food and that was a really good thing. The crowd was totally amazing. I had around 7-8 mocktails and not even a single one disappointed me. All were really good. The pizza both veg and non-veg had thin crust which i didn't like. Otherwise the taste was good. I didn't have complain with any other thing. It was a great experience.
1173,Delhi university ROCKS.....I love to be here....I went out for dinner with family here....For starters:I had tri color chaap tikkas- it was the best chaap I‚Äôve ever had.....And in main course dal makhni and chaap butter masala - every thing we had was outstanding in taste....Breads - i like chilli pranthas and butter naan was also goodIn the end place was worth it Should give it a try....
1174,A great place with awesome food.Non veg preparations are v good.Overall menu has endless variety.Located at prime location the crowd is awesome too.a must visit place.
1175,What are you looking for? Good food? Good Ambience? Live Music? Affordable prices? Yes!! You're looking for the correct place! You can get the best food here in North Campus within affordable prices! Starters are so so so awesome! Loved it! Totally impressed with this place! Service is fast! You can enjoy the live music here in the evening time! In the weekends you need to reserve your table in advance if you don't wannna wait! Because in weekends the minimum wait time is 60 minutes. Mocktails and Shakes are just mouth watering ‚ù§Ô∏èüòç.

1177,I went there for a friend's birthday and enjoyed their  terrace cafe and food a lot. A very lively and romantic ambience specially if you go in winters. I mostly saw college going gentry there and it's good to relive your memories.
1178,one of the best cafe in delhi .. just love the taste & staff members are also good .. i went to this place on my bithday ... seriously the taste was just amazing 
1179,"Just found out that they have overcharged me, great going. Cheating your customers! Everyone please cross check the amount of each dish mentioned in your bill with the amount given in the menu. It did seem strange to me that for such little food that I had ordered, our bill was so high yet on checking the total number of dishes ordered it was fine, now we get it they increase the amount of the dish not the number of dishes ordered!! SHAME."
1180,"About the place:1. God ambiance 2. Nice decor3. Roooftop4. Live music on certain days5. Bar6. Soothing music7. Huge crowd on weekends but calm on weekdaysFood :1.

1181,The presentation of their food is pretty cool some of their dishes might give you a joy of great taste but not all peri-peri chicken tikka is good ambience is average I personally didn‚Äôt like the seating arrangement
1182,"After hearing a lot about this cafe, we finally planned a visit today and it was all about food only. We ordered like never before. Thoroughly enjoyed our day!The food, The ambience (terrace part specially), The music, The staff.. it all made it a spectacular one.I just felt the drinks were little over sweet but the staff was really taking care of our feedback and making changes as per.Apart from this each of veg and non veg starters, paneer tikka and mezzeh platter was to the par. There was bunny chow which was beautifully presented and tasteful.As per the hype, it was well on worth.Do try guys!"
1183,"Mama's Buoi, a good place for North Indian, Continental and Italian cuisines. The service and the ambiance is pretty good. We had many dishes. Many dishes can be highlighted. But I'm highlighting the best among the best :PDirty doubles, Strawberries sparkles, Mama's sangria and laughing watermelon are the best for shakes and mocktails.Signature pizza and Nachos (chicken) should be tried once. But Traditional Greek salad was not up to expectations.In non veg starters, dishes of fish and Chicken were awesome. Other dishes such as Peri peri tikka, drums of heaven, fish finger, veg flatter, veg dim sum are also good.Overall, a great one!"
1184,"This three floor outlet in Hudson lane is serving amazing drinks like death by chocolate, Mama's sundae, coming to food they have delicious non veg on the list. Achari fish tikka, chicken lily pop, drums of heaven and many more.A must visit place in North campus! Good going Mama's Buoi! "
1185,"Pathetic services. Rodents and lizards running here and there next to your table, do you people even follow sanitary norms ?The drinks we ordered had dead mosquitoes in it. Yes  all of this happened! Although they replaced it, but what if I hadn't noticed it? A really bad experience."
1186,Beware...pls check ur bill thoroughly before paying..Generally they overcharge...Food is not that good except some Chinese stuff..More of Hype compared to food quality...Not worthy 
1187,"Such a bad experience we had over there. When we went over there they played a soft music, but after ordering the snacks, they seriously almost switched off the music and the place seemed to be similar to a crematory. We bound to stay there and had to pay for such behaviour and food. Even staff was not cooperative. Also they charged service charge too that was not necessary for such cheap services. Better to try other cafes in gtb guys."
1188,Worst experience being here..non cooperative staff.No value to customer. Will not suggest anyone to hangout here. Better try some other place.
1189,It's a nice place both indoor nd roof top. Nice place for get together and parties. Food nd Ambience is good. I love the pasta nd drinks here.Must visit.. 
1190,I loved the rooftop ambience its super amazing .......food can be better .....restaurant should work on it.....I loved white sauce pasta and the pizza !!!! Please work upon your shakes they taste very normal

1193,"We heard a lot about this place so finally, we visited Mama's Buoi last Saturday. I must say they are setting a different level of Hudson Lane.¬†I would consider this place among the best party place in North campus, they have live music which actually adds a star to your night!We tried Veg Platter, Pizza E Punjab, Appletini & Mama's Bailey & everything was on point. Drinks were high on flavours.A must visit place in North Campus!"
1194,With all the excitement that I came here was ruined in mere seconds.¬†What I ordered :-1) All Season SaladWhile ordering I made sure that I show him the name of the Salad I am ordering as the waiter who came looked perplexed. After 10 minutes the waiter comes with the Caesar Salad. I asked him that on the description it mentions that it has WATERMELON with the iced lettuce and not olives. He said no ma'am this is All Season Salad only and I made him read the description and mentioned that I know what a Caesar Salad is because I have had it more then the number of times you may have served it.¬† He then goes to one guy then another guy then I see 5 waiters talking and roughly after 5...read more

1197,"One of the best cafe. Ambience was good. Food Quality was also good. But we feel like Food quantity was little less. Overall it is a good cafe. We ordered Mocktail, Sangria, nachos, Pizza. Garlic Bread , Magic Moments. Would surely recommend this cafe :) "
1198,Food - 4.5/5Ambiance - 4.5/5Music - 4.5/5Service - 4.5/5Everything in this place is just perfect. From service to the food. Best place to chill with friends and enjoy. üíØ
1199,"Theservice was pathetic and sheesha was way poor it is just a place where you can have good snaps and rest everything is a big zero over here ,will never visit this place again in future"
1200,"If you live near north campus, then Mama‚Äôs Buoi is a must visit place.In my opinion it‚Äôs the best lounge in Hudson lane.The spacd is quite congested that‚Äôs why I am giving 4.5 stars but all rounder it‚Äôs really good place to chill with your friends near north campus."
1201,"You should order dimsums, DBC, pasta, Peri Peri chicken and chicken lasagna. You shouldn't order any shakes.Serving: 4/5.Staff: 4/5.Presentation: 3.5/5.Taste: 4/5.Ambience: 4/5.Overall: 3.7/5."
1202,"I chose the rooftop seating here.The ambience is quite nice but the service and the quality of food is pathetic.The waiter tripped himself and the plate was about to fall,he still served the same plate with remaining mushrooms which I had to get replaced.The managers are courteous but that just couldnt make it up.The most shittiest food I have ever had in a delhi cafe."
1203,"Went there on Sunday night with my cousins and live music was there ..this place is completely worth..we ordered beer ,white sauce pasta ,honey chilly potato over there .Food -: 4Hospitality -: 4Atmosphere -: 4Event -: 5This place is definitely worth visiting .The only thing which was missing was hukkah."
1204,"Happy with the place. Nice roof top, good service and tasty food. Shakes did satisfy the food cravings.A good place for happy and chilled out evenings. Maneet Kaur "
1205,"No one could have ever thought of having such a place in the crowded street of gtb nagar. Its a 3-storeyed restaurant with a decent open roof top. We were in search of a roof top restaurant and luckily came across this one. It had  dull lighting effect which was okay. Coming to the food, it was a mix of likes and dislikes. We tried the manchow veg soup- thumbs up for that. Itwas really tasty. then we ordered stir fried green oyster mushroom and their signature pizza. Though we didn't douns any extra ordinary bit in pizza but definitely liked the mushrooms. Overall its a nice place and must be given  a try."
1206,"With so many cafes and outlet in Hudson lane one gets confused. We just stepped in this outlet and ordered shakes, appetizers and mains. We liked most of the stuff there. Butter chicken was nice and so were shakes. Will come back for more. "

"
1210,"A one of its kind place in Delhi!¬†A perfect place for parties, romantic dinners or casual dining.Must visit..mouth watering food, pastas and the cocktails are truly worth a try!What takes away the cake is the unique mist concept and the environment. Live music adds every desirable spark to your evening!Very supportive staff and excellent management.4.5 for dim lights. (Wanted to give 5 though)P.S. - Must visit guys!"
1211,Place was nice and the ambience was also good... The chilli potatoes were also upto the mark. Loved the quality of beer you have. We got authentic Jim Beam Bourbon
1212,"We went there today to celebrate birthday of a friend. Everything was organised and was on time. We spend almost three hours. Place is awesome, live music, guitar. Must visit atleast once. "
1213,I love the ambience there.One of the best at gtb after vintage avenue.Food-3/5Servive- 1/5The only thing here is nice ambience and sitting area. The food is not so good neither bad. I didn't like the service at all. It was pathetic. They didn't even serve us water. 
1214,I visited this place on their 1 at anniversary. Nice place that plays perfect music. Food is good enough but not great. Service is quick and this place is not at all pricey. Should be tried once. Much better than other GTB nagar restaurant. 
1215,"The rooftop is good with great ambiance but personally I feel that it is a little expensive as compared to cafes like cafeteria and co. which offers us equally delicious food with lower prices.But none the less the service, food, ambiance everything is great so yes I would rate it 4/5. "

1218,"First let's talk about ambience, it has a great ambience, bar area in the middle of it i find it cool. Moreover I sat right behind the bar area so it doesn't have any fumes of hukka. So that's a relief. Moreover their decor peices are quite cool. Now food  i have orderedChicken nachosChicken SteakAnd the Dirty Double Shake. It was good in taste overall I'll give 4.5/5 to food. Nicely served and steak was quite fancy. So big thumbs up to food .And their service was quick and efficient. "

1220,"Mama's Buoi? Errr, no..... please be moi buoi!¬†The whole place is so much in sync with the party feel of the entire Delhi University. As you step in here you realise that you just exited mecca of edcation for a hip party rock dj place. The comfortable seating, peppy colours on the walls, groovy music and ever-inspiring hookah rings, can most certainly get you in a badass mood to partyyyyy!"
1221,"The food was amazing and tongue tittilating! The only drawback I experienced was that it was on the third floor! Too much stairs haha! Anyhow. It was a good experience, the cheese sticks, magical moments, was absolutely named right! Must visit! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"

1224,"Went there with a bunch of friends on a weekend. We ordered Dirty Double Shake and Swiss Lindt Shake. Both were good. For dishes, we ordered Paneer Tikka, Veg Manchurian, Arabiatta Pasta, Mix Veg Dimsums and Pizza. This was the best food I've ever had, atleast among Hudson Lane cafes. However, the quantity of dimsums was lessAmbience was quite amazing. They also offer terrace seating. Do prefer terrace seating at this cafe.Doesnt mean the lower floor wasn't good. It was equally good. I just prefer terrace seating when available. Full credits for the music.Staff was also superb. All in all, best experience. Will soon be visiting this cafe again. "
1225,"Quesdilla not a very popular thing for the hudson lane peeps, but it was tasty and worth a try if you like pita bread or tacos you‚Äôll like this as well. "
1226,Main attraction was Ambience only..I didn't like food there..I had ordered garlic bread and ooozy jumble mocktail.. seriously it was the worst cafe I have ever visited.. talking about their service and serving plates..that was ridiculous as well üòë
1227,Mama's boui .. an outlet In the north campus catering to each and every food needs be it amazing soup to flavoursome north indian delicacies. I got this opportunity to try this outlet last week and it was a wonderful experience ... Their creamy dal makhani and sticks and dips are must try.I tried their all season salad and it had some good combination of fruits and cheese with a lemony touch... Overall a lovely experience and would love to visit again

It was as if the whole North Campus's students had gathered there ro cherish their favorite cafe.The music was so good. Almost all my favorite bands were being played.

1234,"Food quantity was really good, But food taste was zero.

We sat there for 5 minutes, had to ask for water because it wasn't served to us. We ordered a Sheesha and fish fingers to begin with. For half an hour no service, even after reminding them twice about it. Then we ordered a Oreo shake, another no show for 10 minutes (still no sheesha either). the fish fingers came after 20 minutes or so, looked overcooked and tasted stale, the tartar sauce looked watery, overall bad.

1236,Average food and worst services. We ordered hookah and it took 45mins to get the same and he started preparing after cancelling the order. Not at all recommend to go on weekend. They cannot handle more crowdüëéüèª
1237,"Mama‚Äôs buoi, a place in GTB nagar that I would keep on the top, be it the ambience or the service. They are well spread over two floors with an amazing terrace where they have live nights as well.Coming to the food and shakes:Do try their Dirty double shake- that‚Äôs a chocolate and brownie shake with a vanilla ice cream over it, perhaps the best shake here.For starters, do try Corns and their Veg platter. Loved the paneer they served, though the chaap was a bit dry.The Mama‚Äôs pizza was also decent, with loads of veggies over it.Overall, an amazing place to party and is highly recommended."
1238,"Recently went to mama's buoi in du. It is amazing place to chill with friends with really nice rooftop. It is 2 level and we chose to sit on rooftop. It is where they serve sheesha and have nice arabic like setup.We ordered following:#spring roll#chilli mushroom#peri peri fish tikka#chicken on fire#spicy chicken dumpling#crispy cornIn drinks we ordered chocolate shake. I didnt like the non veg dishes as thwy lacked flavour however i loved the veg. I highly recommend it for evening with friends, cool ambience.and veg dishes."
1239,"The most pathetic cafe I've ever been to. The service was absolutely disappointing. The waiters are rude and arrogant . They kept standing at the counter but didn't bother to give us the menu or a glass of water. After having to ask for it , we finally got the menu after sitting there for a good 15 minutes. The food was average and even if it tasted better , I wouldn't want to go back ever because of the service provided."
1240,"Hyped place .. BIG ZERO ON SERVICE ... wanted to rate them zero but zomato doesn‚Äôt give that option ... went for drinks... for menu had to request thrice .. further snacks were delayed .. finally we got so irritated that we thought to leave, request bill at 9:34 n after continuous reminder for bills we were given final bill at 10:15 ... wastage of almost 45 min ... when we complained the manager did not even listen .. ZEROOOOO priority to customer ... "
1241,Nice place with good music and decent food. Hookah and alcohol are the plus points here to fully unwind and relax. üëçüëç. Didn‚Äôt get a chance to sit in the rooftop but I am sure that would be a highlight for some other evening or maybe an excuse to visit again. 
1242,"I couldn't give less than 5/5 to this amazing place.No matter what, this place remains one of my favorite ones.1. As soon as u enter, the ambience you feel is amazing. They have an outdoor seating as well with a spectacular view.2. The service is little slower when the crowd is more but they are very polite and decent.3. Now the food they provide is very authentic and amazing. Out of all the places, i found this to be a genuine place in terms of flavor. From mexican to italian to lebanese, everything is so unique.4.

The food is great, except the veg dimsums, i just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to finish one of those after taking a bite. The best part of my visits were the spring rolls. The best i‚Äôve ever had. "
1244,"Certainly the only good place serving alcohol and hookah in North Campus, this place serving continent cuisine has terrrace sitting also. That gives brownie points to it. Coming to food they had everything like any other joint in campus has, from starters to main course.We started up with Butter Chicken Balls, came in 6 pieces the well fried balls had butter chicken stuffing layered with nread crumbs and topped with jalape√±o.

Instead this is a actually I recent finding of mine and Mama's buoi had a major role in this enlightenment that got bestowed upon me.Friday is that day of the weekend that everyone (by everyone I meant us blessed ones who got 5 day working offices) waits for with bated breath and dreams filled eyes as partying at weekend is one of the main motivation for us to get up in the morning and start the daily grind all the while doing the countdown in our mind for the coming weekend.

So few floors up we even weren't sure that we are going to the right building. Then somehow when we heard music coming we reached and found a seat. They didn't even asked for water. The waiters were so busy that after calling them, they were asking each other to go and take the order. Coming to the food, we ordered a pasta and mojito. The drink was okay but the quantity of pasta was so little with a tiny peice of garlic bread that too seemed stale.

1249,"I went to this place today in gtb nagar. It had a really good ambience, the service was also okay.The food tasted really good. We tried chilli garlic noodles (both chicken and veg) which tasted nice. Mama‚Äôs special pizza is also a must have if you like no crust or thin crust pizzas. Drums of heaven is also a must try if you like chicken. Chicken tandoori was also good, half plate has 4 pieces. Salty vegetables was also good.Overall quality of food was satisfactory.The beverages were also nice. We tried double trouble, you can try this if you love brownies, apart from that the regular sangria and mojito. However, their sheesha quality was not good as it kept hurting the...read more"
1250,"Last month i went to Mama's Buoi with my friend..Ambiance, music and food.. all found at one place is always feel good and yes we can say this is the one of those places however, I don't like their sitting arrangement because I don't get the comfortable seat.. it is just next to the entrance which is very disturbing factor..But they serve food very nicely and on time..I ordered chilly chicken (my all time favourite) and signature pizza..Taste of chilly chicken is good. Those who don't like spices much.. I like pizza.. which is properly prepared.. crispy munchy and delicious.. must try **"
1251,"After hearing so many good things, finally had a chance to visit this place.I was a walkin with a group, so was asked that they‚Äôll be packed after 8:30, which means we have to leave by then. No issues in that, as reservation is always necessary for this place, as I have heard.Interiors at roof wasn‚Äôt much to look at, but comfortable sitting and a nice view.Service is too slow. Food ordered: Chilli Potato, Chilli Paneer, Tiranga Chaap, Classic Oreo, virgin Mojito and Masala Coke.Chilli Potato: they weren‚Äôt crisp, flavours could have been much better and same can be said for Chilli paneer.Chaap platter had 3 types in it, haryali, Afghani and Tandoori, none of them had taste....read more"

1255,"I would like to start off by taking about the ambience. The music was blaring and too loud for my liking. The food was pretty good. However the quantity and quality don't match the price. The chiken biriyani was very average. The pizza was good.I would not visit this place again ,GTB nagar has better options for cafes and restaurants."
1256,"That was the first time i had been there at mama's Buoi on hudson lane. Food-wise it was not up to the mark. We ordered achari chap, dahi kawab and drinks. Coming to achari chap taste wise it was actually weird did not like the taste at all üëéüèª as they used sesame oil. Rest dahi kawab was ok -ok. talking about ambiance i'll give full star, live music, songs just blew my mind. enjoyed a lot. Food - 3.5Ambiance- 5Service - 4.5"

You can judge my eagerness for sharing the experience based on the fact that I started writing the review as soon as I reached back home from there.The owners have done an amazing job in keeping the decor of the place simple thus maximizing seating that too without cluttering the place. The outlet has all types of seating options...read more"
1258,Okay so basically this is the IT place in Hudson Lane where u actually get an amazing ambience just like any other cafe in CP.This is one of those cafes which is always full and you have to reserve a table beforehand especially for the table at rooftop and bdw on weekends they don't take reservations so by reservation i mean for weekdays. So you can imagine the popularity of this place.So i had been to this place twice but recently managed to get a table on rooftop(without reservation woohhoo) and that is main USP of the cafe.So it was Friday evening and lemme tell you it was housefull. There was this amazing night going on with live music which just made the evening more...read more
1259,"Mama's Buoi, one of the popular and best place in gtb serves a wide range of seesha and food. It is a nive place to chill and relax with some soothing and good quality music. Great staff and hospitality with nice ambience and crowd. It also provides terrace (best to relax in suitable weather). The service on terrace is good and quick bt a lil bit slow downstairs.One should must have peri peri chicken, cheese grilled sandwich.Also honey chilli potato and shangriya were good.One can also have delicious Indian food like daal makhni and kadhai panner.Overall it is one of the best place to have some mouthwatering food along with drinks and seesha. "
1260,"Mama's buoi was a really pleasant experience to me and to my friends owing to its great food and hospitality.We ordered chicken malai tikka, and chicken pizza starters. The Butter Chicken that we ordered was really very nice.The hookah was perfect. The service was really good, Special Thanks to Ms. Anna Nain for taking care of us.All over, our experience was great. A must visit place when around."
1261,"Another food point , as I heard of it, but the visit turns somewhat different.  The place has good seating, ambience and service. No doubt the place by look and arrangement was good.coming to the food, was a bit led down for me , the eateries were not as such to be appreciated.  However the shakes were good."
1262,"An absolutely delightful place, the first thing that strikes you about this place is the great ambience. We went there on Sunday night and the place was full to the brim. We could only get a table on the 3 Floor and that too after waiting at the bar counter for about 15 mins. The fact that they have a bar is actually quite unique as you don't get many such places in GTB Nagar. For drinks, we ordered a Strawberry Blueberry shake and a French Cosmopolitan. Both the drinks were very good. For the food, we ordered the Melting Moments (mozarella cheese sticks), the Garden Fresh Pizza and the Triple Soya Chaap (Masala, Tandoori and Malai Chaap). The sticks were just about average with a little...read more"

1267,"You must be good in maths before thinking about this restaurant .. coz they will analyse the ppl by the ratio of ur group, it must match your group otherwise no matter how long it took you to reach the place.. YOU WILL NOT BE GIVEN THE ENTRY..not coz they r full but coz you are stag even if you hv a lady with u.. stupidiest thing u ll ever come across.. "
1268,"Just remember that you permanently loose customers when you offer stupid reasons like ""humara ratio nhi baithta"" to deny 5 people a table as they won't ever come back again even if the ""ratio"" improves...."

It is bit difficult to find but once you're there, you enjoy alot as there is good food and superb music!! I tried couple of items but the best out of the lot was Cheesy Nachos which was so yummy and cheese as it was perfectly baked to perfection!! Steam momos are also a hit among youngsters here, which I personally also loved it.Mr. Rampal recommends this place for small get together or a chit chat session with your buddies!"
1288,I must appreciate the staff first. I ordered Tiranga Soya Chaap and buffalina pizza served with chilled beer. Soya chaap was mouth watering and pizza was delicious. And the best part was you can enjoy terrace sitting with live music.

1297,Amazing place! Gives you CP feels in Hudson lane. The food is good too. Falls in the affordable range in terms of prices. The only thing I felt a little disappointing was that it doesn't have too many options for the vegetarians. Worth for money otherwise.
1298,Its a very nice place. Has amazing food and a lot of food choices to choose from. It also has a very nice terrace. Its cozy and its fun to be here.

We ordered chicken malai tikka, chicken wings, and chicken bun pizza for the starters. For mains, we ordered butter chicken and breads along with a cold coffee. I loved the starters and they were absolutely spot-on, however, I didn't like the gravy of butter chicken. It was a little tangy. The hookah was perfect and its service was super fast, unlike most places. For desserts, they only had brownie and ice cream sizzler, which was pretty decent in taste. All over, my experience was great. A must...read more"
1316,Nice place to hangout with friends in local. And staff are cooperative. But they have seating issues. I was willing to sit at roof top but unfortunately I had to sit at 3rd floor instead of rooftop that's the saddast part. 
1317,The worst cafe ever. Service is so bad. The waiters won't listen to you even if you call them 10 times.Then the will force you to pay them service charge.I won't recommend anyone to go to Mama's Buoi ever.
1318,"It was a nice experience go visit this place food is delicious and the service was amazing place is really nice with good ambiance, worth it "
1319,"Thanx for the Wonderful Experience along with the ""Double Blast with Taal Sutra by DJ Shiv"", Awesome Food, Great Atmosphere, Loved this place, will definitely come again...Made my Birthday even more memorable...Thanx once again..."

1321,"Hey guys, the music was awesome and loved the service. The staff was courteous and really polite. Although the place was packed they weren't arrogant like to let us down. Loved the chilli potatoes. For me the highlights were good music and great interiors. When you enter it's decorated with beautiful lamps. Have heard a lot abt the terrace but couldn't get a seat there. Definetly coming for this terrace view next time . Keep it up :)"
1322,"This place is another peppy and groovy cafe in the Hudson fame. Amazing choice of music, great live sport screening.A facility for Sheesha and Liqueur.Tried their French Cosmopolitan and it stole my heart away. Just so subtle and great after taste.The Red Wine Sangria is amazing with fresh apples and no non sense but absolutely good Red Wine.I love their Crispy Lamb, it's dry and saut√©ed with peppers and Vegetables‚Äã.Their Mozerella Cheese sticks with 3 dips are good too.I also love their Garlic Toast with peppers and an addition of Tobasco makes it great to go.They have a good range of mocktails as well which are amazing to try.Good service and great ambiance."
1323,"We visited the place based on its rating and we were amazed by the quality of food they served. We ordered melting moments, signature pizza, dahi ke kabab and jack daniels burger. We didn't like the burger much as it was dry rest of the food was good. Food: 8/10Ambience: 8/10Staff: 9/10"
1324,"Well couldn't stop my mouth from watering just by looking at the picture of ""4goat cheese pizza"" the best 4 cheese thin crust pizza I've had, tbh. The quantity and the quality of cheese on it was worth every penny. Ordered a penne alfredo [forgot to take a snap] and a Veg Caesar salad [clicked the picture of last bite] was pretty good. I don't eat chicken much but the tikka served had a smokey aroma, cause of which I couldn't resist my self. The chicken was tender and juicy served with perfect blend of chutney. Alcohol served was chilled but a bit pricy than expected. "
1325,"Great food, loved the flavours, specially no veg. Service is slow for the food, for drinks the service is very good. Ambience is awesome. They can work a little bit on their waiters. Will be going again in sometime again. "
1326,The best part of this cafe is the terrace they provide for seating.Lovely place to hangout and chill.Chilli potatoes was perfect and best in taste.I would surely recommend this place.

They also have great alcohol and sheesha options with fancy concoctions and crazy hukkahs !! Although the food seemed pretty average , they have a nice rooftop with wide seating scene ! Do order veg and chicken dimsums as they are really mouth watering . Also their orep shake made with cream cheese is really thick and delish !!

1329,"A very hep place in just the very beginning of GTB Nagar if you enter from the opposite side of the metro station.It's a really nice outlet with 2 storeys, the upper being the open air.Tried some amazing dishes and drinks.My favourite among them were-Hunan Fish, Mutton Seekh Kebabs, Cheese Sticks with three dips and the Bacon and Egg Pizza.The Red Wine Sangria is near to perfection and is a very very good drink for any cocktail lover from the menu here.In the shakes- A must try is the Dirty Double. It's sinful and quite a wholesome. Recommended with excessive Stars. It's a winner.Loved it here with the music and ambiance, the service was fast and really cooperative."
1330,"One of the most ideal places in Hudson lane to hang out with friends. With its location right on the main road and, this place is easily accessible. The variety offered in the menu is good. The food and drinks served are of good quality and give value for money.The staff is polite and friendly. The place is very comfortable to spend quality time with friends.With such a good experience on my visit. I look forward to visit Mama's buoi again."
1331,"Went at around 12:30 on a weekend,and found the place quiet empty and the terrace area not ready.If you get the chance have a seat on terrace,its beautiful,provided the weather is same too.So,we had college mojito,spring roll and veg momos.Spring roll was crispy and nice,mojito too was good with a bit of strawberry flavour.Momos though was a nightmare..too strong flavored for momos with heavy filling..music bit loud but ambience is nice..terrace area is beautiful..Worth giving a shot!"
1332,A quality place to hang out . The environment is amazing and they have terrace too . They also appoint live band to put the cherry on the cake . However the food quality can be improved but the presentation of food is good . 
1333,"Mama's buoi is a fun place in GTB nagar . The decor is simple and pretty much like what you get at other cafes . They also have a nice rooftop with good seating . Veg dimsums , and quesadillas are a must try here .. They also have amazing shakes and mocktails with just right consistency and flavour !! Do not forget to try their orer vanilla shake and virgin mojoto !! I also ordered buffolina pizza and nachos . They were pretty average. This place surely is a winner for my alcoholic and sheesha buddies as they have a variety of options for both ! All in all , it was a fine experience."
1334,"Worst Place to Go...!!Total Hype nothing new...From manager to waiters everyone was rude considering themselves as owner,Food was below average...No one was there to take our order and at the time of leaving they were asking for tips..Not suggested to anyone...!!"

1337,"For some reason this place has got really good ratings even till now, the reason why I decided to visit this cafe. It is located at GTB Nagar at the end of the of the long lane of cafes somewhere on the 2nd floor of a weird distinct building. The first issue was to locate the cafe because the board on the ground floor which I assume was put to notify people however, it failed terribly since you might be just standing below the cafe and now know which door to enter and which floor to go to. The ambience of the place was indeed better than what you expect at GTB Nagar but, the food was not that good.

Mama's Buoi certainly features in the top 3 places in the campus area.The ambience, food and service are all top notch. I would start by praising the Butter Chicken Cheese Bun as probably the best thing on the menu. Exceptionally good dish.The other things that I really liked and would recommend other who visit to try are:>Spring Rolls>Jalapeno Cheese Bread>Chicken Dimsums> Crispy LambWill rty the other varieties the next time I visit and then update here."
1339,"That's an awsome place I visited last night with my best friend. Great ambience , great food. Music was really good. Overall justified my money and time."
1340,"Hudson Lane has always been one of my favorite places for relishing delicious food at highly inexpensive  prices. And with rising social media buzz about Mama's Buoi at Hudson, I was quite enthralled to visit this new addition to the area.AmbienceSimilar to the other cafe in the area, this place also have majority of young Delhi University students enjoying their food and sheeshas without the cheque being too heavy on pocket. Only problem that I had was with the music which was very loud. I hardly could anyone on the table because of that.Food Lemme take you through some of my favorites from the menu :Butter chicken pizza bun - For the love of butter chicken and cheese I would...read more"
1341,"What a place! Breaking the mindset about Hudson Lane, this place is beyond your expectations. Such amazing artists performing live music. This three-floor cafe¬†gives you amazing party feel in North campus and if you are a sheesha lover then you should not miss out on this.¬†Chilli Paneer & pizza is highly recommended!"
1342,"Had chicken malai tikka , drums of heaven and in main course we had butter chicken with laccha parantha and in dessert browni with vanilla ice cream sizzler awsome food with awsome interiors i just love the place and service was great too."
1343,"Have heard about this place a lot from many of my friends, so I was curious to visit.Finally I planned to go there.The place is very nice with a soothing ambience, dim lights and ample space.The place was almost full when i went there. The usual crowd you can see here is mostly college students and youngsters.Wo ordered:Verdure Pizza: It was a thin crust pizza topped with vegetables like broccoli, pesto, babycorn and other veggies. It was different than a usual pizza. It was decent and a good suggestion for the health freaks.Spring Rolls: They were one of the best from all the dishes we ordered.

1344,"Mama's Buoi, a casual dining place in Gtb Nagar. It is a 2 floor property serving food indoors and terrace.I with a friend paid a random visit to them for quick snacks and we ordered,DIRTY DOUBLE, it was a bit on a bitter side and not what I had on my last visit.CORN SALT AND PEPPER, crispy corns tossed in pepper and onion, it was flavourful and tasted amazing.SIGNATURE PIZZA, vegetarian pizza with baby corn, broccoli, mushroom and other sauteed veggies with crispy thin crust.VEGETARIAN PLATTER, was presented nicely and had, chaap which was dry, aptly spiced mushrooms, soft, seekh kebab which was good in taste and chewy paneer tikka served with mint chutney and onion rings."
1345,"This place offers alcohol, hookah and a range of amazing and excellent food. The ambience is worth the talk and this cafe offers the best of chicken! üòç I had nachos, pasta, chicken wings, chilly potato, pizza and some amazing refreshing drinks. Visiting this place made my day! ‚ô•Ô∏è"
1346,I Should Say Its Good Place For Photography but Its Really Expensive üëéWhich Is A Bad Point But The Food Is So Damn Yummn and Hookha Lovers Should Do Visit This Place üòÑ
1347,"Went to this place with my friends...tried their  pasta,  chicken tikka and dahi kabab..also orderd their signature pizza...The food was too bad in taste as well as quality...The staff lacks ettiquetes as well..My experience to this place was worst..not recommended at all...Dont waste your money here guys..."
1348,I went by this place the previous evening and It was only an arbitrary visit there . The place was energetic and pleasant . The place is sufficiently enormous to oblige many people at once . Requested a sheesha which was exceptionally well made and a chicken tikka sandwich which was okay in taste . The administration ought to be enhanced a little with some tiny bit of changes there could make it outstanding amongst other spots. I likewise found out about its pool party custom that is sorted out on sundays . It is without a doubt an astonishing thing to know.
1349,"I'd like to give this place full because everything was literally great here. The sheesha, the food, the service. You just can't find a stag table here on weekends. I like the butter chicken pizza bun and melting moments the most. The shakes were thick and really good. The manager here named Pankaj Gupta is a really helpful person and kind one as well. "
1350,Small place with very loud music.. good staff.. ambience was jusk ok-ok. I didn't find it too attractive. We ordered tiranga chaap which includes the three kinds of flavour and I really enjoyed its each bite. Dirty double shake & sangria were also good in taste. The only meal that disappointed me most was nachos.. it wasn't as good as I was expecting. It's a pocket friendly caf√©.
1351,"Being in a place where new cafe opens on every second day , this place provide nothing new. Their menu card was torn apart as if they really don't care , waiter asking for tip which was disappointing.But this place serves alcohol which is rare in gtb Nagar cafes. In soup I ordered manchow soup which was very good in taste then tried signature pizza in which cheese was sour in taste. "
1352,"Mamas Buoi is a popular outlet in the Hudson Lane area.It is has been here for quite sometime.It is probably one of the best places in this area.Their service isnt good at all.You literally have to beg for the staff to come and order your queries or something.Have tried White Sauce Pasta,Spring Roll,Veg Seekh Kebab,Chilly Potato,Dal Makhani,Fried Rice and Noodles.Food taste wise has never been an issue but twice a hair came in food.It was a task to get the items replaced which was shocking because thats now how you behave when something like this happens but no issues!Haven't visited the place in a long time now just because of the hygiene doubts I've in my mind now."
1353,This is the best lounge/ cafe in hudson lane! Providing you with a very impressive ambience and a beautiful terrace. The food they serve is too good. Even the service is nice. Their watermelon mojito is just soo amazing. Even their hookah is too good! A great place to chill in with your squad.
1354,"Located in the north campus area of delhi. The place is just perfect for chilling with friends! I went there on my birthday and I must say it was completely worth it! It was saturday night and the cafe had live singing!! Ohhmmyygodd!! Everything was so good! The music, the crowd, the food!! Everything!! We had corn chat, pizza, garlic bread and nachos! Really good! I had the time of my life! Will definetely come again!!"
1355,"We sat on the rooftop outdoors which was nice and the food was okay at best. The staff was absolutely abysmal though, they paid us no attention and refused to change our table though others were empty. The manager was also pretty rude. "
1356,Nice placeNice musicTerrace is what takes my heart about this placeFinest place in hudson lane !Great quality of food and sheesha!An absolutely amazing place to hangout with your friends!

1359,"Went there with my friends for a chilled out evening, sad to say but I was highly disappointed. The food is overrated, the service slow and the staff barely listens to you. They took around 30 minutes to serve us just water despite us repeatedly asking them to. The food was bland and highly over priced. Definitely not a value for money. "
1360,"4.0 is just for the food. Daal makhani, tandoori veg platter and mix sauce pasta was amazing. This place is really good to have food and drinks but the service was pathetic. Only disappointment was service though I visited this place for the very first time."
1361,"Tops on the list of all-that-shines-is-not-always-gold. From the list of a dozen beverages' option, they keep just 2 and bring the food all tasty, Hell NO! And don't be surprised if the pipe of your hukka comes out or they run out of filters, it's usual Saturday for them. From dahi kebabs to lime soda, peach ice tea to paneer tikka, everything was a nightmare. Full marks to your ambience and all show-sha, but what if your main ingredient (food n beverages) sucks big time? P.S. either give your chef the leaves he must have been asking for, from a long time or change him/her please."
1362,Very good food Nysh service .But hookah was not good ....Dj was also good ...Hookah was so big thats the reason smoke not came Anyways Nysh place Thanks
1363,"Its a nice place to hangout, chicken can be improved but veg springrolls were hell awesome...nice place to hangout, the worst part was that the beer was not chilled...apart from that its a nice place...chicken punjabi pizza was yum and staff was nice"
1364,Ambience 4/5Food 4/5Hookah 3/5Food wqs nice ambience is cool but i personally dont like the hookah quite expensive but money worth I ordered one hookah one pizza veg one mix sauce pasta and oreo shake and virgin mojito everthing was nice. 
1365,Mama buio is a good place for party especially on weekend. The place was good. Ambiance was superb. Crowd was also good. Staff was well behaved. Service was good. The best thing was the hookah which was very good. The serving of Tower hookah is very cheap as compared to other cafe. Food was good. Overall its a good place to go for a party wid frnds.
1366,"Horrible place. Don't visit here . The staff is not bothered to take order, menu is torn and the ambience is not pleasant enough . The price charged is not proportional to the experience at this cafe. The quality has deteriorated drastically."
1367,"I visited mama's boi for the first time today. Just to give a summary of how it was, the experience was pathetic. The hookah was aweful. Thanks a lot for spoiling my evening as well as my mood. If you wanna continue like then please do me a favour, shut the cafe."
1368,"Food, Satisfactory. Ambiance, Wonderful Service, Great.Friendly staff. Quite Spacious for parties.A good hangout place.Awesome place to visit again."
1369,"‚ÄåThis is a good place to hang out with friends. I have visited around three times but this time I quite disappointed with the place. We ordered Chilli pizza, Mix veg coriander dim sum , Crispy fried szechwan and Ek number hukkah. Food was good but their service was less than average, you'll keep asking about your order and when we almost done with our food they came up with our hookah.‚ÄåOverall the place serves fine food but they really need to work on their management and service staff. "
1370,As all the snacks was totally good but the hookah was very bad and when u go to mama buois in weekends pls first book ur table then go i got the space difficultyI advise u the beer was not very costly and terrace was made very goodly but it is usefull ar night.Conclusion: was do visit and all the snacks was awesome if u order hookah then said the waiter make it good 
1371,Well a place where u can be having a feeling of your college days. About food it was good to taste. Order hookah and that I would suggest was really awesome. Beer served was not chilled the only thing made to rate it low
1372,The food here is very nice. It's resonable.But the place is too conjested. There should be more space or the sitting arrangement should be done in a proper way .
1373,My visit to this restaurant didn't go as I expected. The rooftop pic is fake. There's nothing like any of it. Downstairs it is very congested. Lighting is good. Ambience is good. Food is ok ok. I don't find anything interesting or that i can come here to eat again. Pizza was ok ok. Paneer tikka is good and presentation of it was nice. I didn't like the dahi kabab. Drinks are nice. Worth trying.Quantity of food is good. Servicing is fast. So there are few negative and positive points. Overall all it's nice decent restaurant. 
1374,"Been here thrice last month itself and twice this month and can happily continue to go again!üïé**What I saw(Ambience)**üïéAs you climb up the stairs to terrace, you see walls covered with beer bottles. As you reach the terrace, you are enchanted by its unusual and cool setup (considering other cafes in GTB). No doubt a serious crowd puller and mostly packed, this place has a beautiful roof top (although you do have an option to sit inside as well); Rustic theme emphasized with walls showing red bricks, scooter as a wall hanging, dim lighting and breeze flowing sums up to the ambiance. They do have fans with water to keep the terrace cool..They have live music almost everyday...read more"
1375,"It was  a quite excellent service provided by the staff . Food was at its best , the atmosphere was lightening . Overall it was outstanding and overwhelming experience at mumma's boi . ....! "
1376,Find this place totally over-hyped in GTB. It has become this kid-teenage area with 12-14 years of kids having sheesha- which is absurd. The only good thing about this place is the live music at times. Otherwise it is super loud and it becomes intolerable. The food here- Average. The chilly chicken was good and the pasta was below average. The seekh dish was totally undercooked and sucked- which I actually gave another try after months.
1377,It was an okay experience. I ordered sandwiches which were good. The outdoor seating is really nice but the service is very slow. I could not find something very exciting. It was just like any other cafe. 
1378,"This review can help you saving time and money:Who charges vat and gst at the same time? And service charge? They do. Might be because kids come there and they don't know much about the taxes. Now lets come to the food: might not be the place it is famous for, but the quality of food should be maintained. But they don't. Liquor : only bira and Kingfisher was available. I was being charged 350 + 20 percent vat + 10 percent service charge + gst üòÇ. Its not justified. But i was there with guests so i kept my silence. Paid the bill. And left to never come back again here. Music: it was loud, and not tolerable. Croud: kids. Even group of 12-13 years kids having sheesha there. I am not...read more"
1379,"I am so happy that I visited this outlet in GTB Nagar. The ambience of the place is lovely, and they were playing really good songs. We ordered Chilli paneer pizza, dirty double, strawberry shake, chicken fries and tiranga chaap, and everything was just so delicious. The preparation and presentation was definitely unique and upto the mark. I had a great time over there and will definitely pay another visit to this cafe. "
1380,"I simply love this place.From the food to the ambience to the service, everything is great.The place is so lit on weekends with live music.Must get reservations before hand since the place is mostly crowded."
1381,"It is kind of tough to climb to 3rd floor but it's totally worth it. One of very few places in Hudson Lane which is serving alcohol. We ordered some Nachos and Paneer Tikka pizza. While the Nachos were average, Paneer Tikka was just AMAZING! Everything was just worth the prize. A pint of beer costs ‚Çπ130 ( exclusive of taxes ) which is very cheap compared to other cafes in Delhi. Do Visit. "
1382,"It's not my usual go-to choice when I want to have a couple of drinks but it makes a practical one since it's pretty close to where I live . Chose to sit on the terrace with a couple of girlfriends since the live music was beginning soon . We were told in advance that the table we subsequently occupied was reserved for someone else . It was okay since we didn't plan on staying for more than a while . We ordered nachos - topped with sickly salty sauce , pizza - average fare , seemed a little dry , drums of Heaven - ketchupy ! Ordered some whiskey to go with the food . Total damage - 3k Service was prompt . I could have scored this place a wee bit higher if only they didn't usher us out of...read more"
1383,"I was here with a friend. They served amazing hukkah ! Really good and their signature pizza is a must ! It was extremely delicious. The only disappointing thing was we didn't have any options in the beer section so we had to go with bira. If you are here make sure to make reservations, its supercrowded and too much waiting. We were lucky we got here right on time"
1384,"This was my second visit to the place only because I found it to be different than the rest of the restaurants that I have been to in the vicinity. They have an indoor floor seating and a terrace seating area. They have bands, solo performers, match screenings and other live performances each day. Though I din't really like the guy singing on terrace on my first visit.So talking about the ambience, it pretty much matches any decent restaurant in CP. This is one of the few places serving liquor in GTB. The menu is quite similar to what you will find around. Continental, Italian, Indian to name some.We ordered:‚Ä¢ veg signature pizza - it was one thing that I liked from my first visit...read more"

1388,"Like any other day was strolling around the lanes of north campus  when me and my friend decided to visit this cafe for dine in. As we settled we ordered for toblerone shake and chocolate shake alongwith ceaser salad for starters. Next we ordered Kadhai paneer pizza bun , veg lasagne and melting moment. All the three entrees were sumptuous and yummy. To end the lovely experience we ordered Death by chocolate. On the whole we had a splendid time at Mama's Buoi. Would definitely recommend it to more if my friends for an amazing dine in experience."
1389,The ambience and and the atmosphere is great plus the staff is super cool and there food is fantabulous. A must visit place for a good budget party‚ù§Ô∏è
1390,"A very reasonable place with an awesome ambience. The taste and presentation of the food is absolutely amazing. There were 4 of us and the bill came upto 2k. We ordered two pastas, a burger(ghost burger), chicken dumplings, a pan rasna hookah, a milkshake and a mocktail. Everything we ordered had a good quality and quantity. I highly recommend this place. "
1391,"The best place till now in GTB Nagar. You've definitely gotta try this one. With an amazing ambience , decor and vast menu to offer , this place has got everything ranging from drinks , soft beverages , starters , main course , desserts and hookah. Ordered for Toblerone shake , butterscotch shake and mixed fresh lime soda for drinks. For starters ordered melting moments , Kadhai paneer pizza bun and ceaser salad. Melting moments were cheese rolls which were soft and tender but crispy on the outside. Kadhai paneer buns had sumptuous filling inside the bun. It was topped with cheese and roasted well. It was soft yet delicious at the same time. Ceaser salad was full of fresh lettuce leaves...read more"
1392,Been to almost every cafe at gtb Nagar. This was the time to try this one with my wife. But it was bad experience. A really bad one.Interior were okay they tried their best to make it look good. But it was dark which made the place look shaddy.Service was very very slow.I ordered -- Buffalina pizza - it's one of the basic pizza.. but was very dry and tasteless. And it was cold when it came on table.- tandoori veg platter - only mashroom was okay. Rest was terrible.- walnut sizzling brownie - first it didn't come on sizzling plate as said in menu. Brownie was very chewyWoudn't recommend it to anyone.
1393,"The live music , the hukka on terrace , the food which is lip smacking. What else can we ask for ?  Love the place and the comfort.  If you are at north campus , do visit.  "
1394,"Thanks to zomato for always guiding us where to eat. Today I went there with my friend. Here we ordered their very famous melting moments and chilli paneer pizza.Melting moments- they were fried Mozrella cheese sticks, they were really good. High calorie content but something one should definitely have. I loved it 4.5 to it.Pizza- we ordered chilli paneer pizza and it was yum, thin crust crisp, fully loaded with cheese and the topping of chilli paneer was amazing too. I loved it seriously.Ambience is really nice. Music floats all over the place, courteous staff. Loved the place. If you really wanna enjoy food then definitely check this place out. "

Wherever we sat, there was water dripping from the ceiling due to rains. After the rain stopped we decided to go to the rooftop, the chairs were highly uncomfortable. It was very messy and the management least cared about it. Coming to food , it was okay. It was quite delayed and not appreciated. Overall, the service was just okay. Sanskriti Bhatnagar Divya Mittal "
1398,"The place is located in GTB Nagar and is very appealing though its a but difficult to locate for first time visitors, but once u reach there its worth having your meal there. The place, music, food and service everything is good.I had--1. Lemon Iced Tea- Fresh and chilled drink best for summers and gave my meal a good start.2. Big buddy burger- Yes its true its really big and delicious.3. Nachos- Its my favourite from this place. Veggies and cheese spreaded all over the nachos. It was delicious"

They use good sheesha's but they dont know how to prepare it and also there is inadequate space to enjoy the sheesha.. you litreally have to keep it beside your chair. Coming to the food.. We ordered Pizza , Noodles , Garlic bread, Arabiatta pasta .. the taste was just OK . Nothing special about that taste! Average.However it is easy on pocket. So thumbs up for that üëç"

1424,It is located in gtb nagar. Which is a grey location as it is near delhi university. This place is always crowded as they have sheesha too at nominal prices. This place is really crowded on weekends so prior booking is advised. They have the best sheesha in this area. This place is open till 12:30 in midnight. They have live music which is rare. The singers are really professional they singh Hindi Bollywood songs and punjabi songs as well. They have valet parking facility available too.The service is a bit slow. The food taste is really good even the quantity is good enough for two to three people. Some drawbacks of this place that service is an it slow and they need to work on...read more
1425,"When you enter GTB market, you will witness cafes across both sides of the street. I kept moving forward looking for a new treat. There I saw this board with a catchy name ‚ÄúMama‚Äôs Buoi‚Äù. I was keen to explore what it‚Äôs all about so went inside. Though it took a min to figure out entrance since signage is an issue and building looked unfrequented. FYI: It‚Äôs on third floor guys!"
1426,"A perfect Place To Hangout With Friends ! Ambience is Very Elegant With Soft Music And Also There Is Rooftop Seating ! The Food was Really Good , I ordered Chilly potato , Momos , Spring Roll , Chilli Paneer , Dry Manchurian Which Were pretty Good in (Quantity Was Very Less). Shakes were Very Good And it had a good taste. ( Presentation Could be more better ) It was very Much Crowded . So Book Before You go ! The Staff Was Friendly and Courteous . As compared to other Cafes in Hudson Lane , This is little Overpriced ! "
1427,Nice ambience and amazing food except dahi ke kabab which were salt less and oily. We don't have any other complaints from dem service food soup everything was mouth watering specially falafel n hummus pita and the songs played dere were so nice and soothing. Thank you for dis good experience. Definitely going back.
1428,"Mama's buoi is by far one of the best I have visited in Gtb Nagar!! :)Situated on the 3rd floor this place has ample seating area.The ambience is quite quirky and vibrant with a live DJ and an amazing vibe. They even have a beautiful sitting area on the terrace which one can enjoy in this monsoon season. One complaint though is that the music is a bit loud which sometimes hinders with your conversations. Coming to the most important part, Food here is absolutely DELICIOUS!!

1429,I checked into this cafe with 5 other friends of mine..We were there to celebrate my friend's birthday party but ended up with all messed up mood because of the unprofessional behaviour shown by the cafe staff.. despite of asking for a table for 6 and making up a heavy bill we were asked to leave the table as soon as we finished up our meals saying That the table was reserved..And that was insulting.. Something not expected .. Though the food was fine but everything went in vain after this attitude was shown..I think I'll never visit this cafe again..
1430,"It was my birthday and i went to this restaurant with friends. We were 6 people and checked in at 3 pm we had a good time and we also paid a huge bill to the restaurant despite of all that they asked us to leave at 4 because the seat they provided us was already booked by someone else. This behaviour was very unprofessional, if the seat was pre booked they shouldn't have give it to us. The food was good but I'm never visiting again"
1431,Expected so much from here but it's extremely horrible. The food (cheese sticks) and shakes were disgusting. Never visit this place! Just a waste of money and time.
1432,"Took some time to locate the place , as it is located on the third floor but it was worth the effort !Ambience is cozy and a bit loud.¬†Menu is vast with a huge variety of Non-Veg food items.Ordered chicken lolypop which was mouth watering !Murg Malai pao was decent , Veg Munchurian was too good again !Overall nice place with good quality food !"
1433,"Situated on the 3rd floor, this place is full of life.. and food! You start hearing the music on 1st floor itself. My friend and I chose to have late lunch on saturday. On reaching this looked like the most happening place there ! The waiting time was about 30-40 min. They have enough space inside for waiting so theres no worry of waiting in the heat outside !On settling, we started our meal with a veg platter. It was a big one with a variety of things in it, including various types of paneer and chaap, dahi ke kebab and seekh kebab. I was really impressed with the quantity. I personally loved paneer and dahi ke kebab amongst those.One thing that anybody visiting this outlet should try...read more"
1434,"This place has been like a 2nd home to me. Great food, cheap drinks and damn good staff.Though have been a pain in the ass for the people there asking for whisky at no-alcohol days..People would want to try the pizza's and the crispy stuffed mushrooms. Steaks are must. Hats off to Sahil and Gaurav for running this place so efficiently. I don't give rivews though but this place desrves it."

This is a big restro spread iver three floors including a beautiful terrace. The interiors are also quirky and impressive. Also the music system of this place is real good and their playlist is also praiseworthy.Coming to food, they have a simple menu with lots of varieties.

1442,Very confused staff and total mismanagement. It took 1 hour to find a seat and despite being over staffed the place and people are totally confused..poor management 
1443,"If you are in GTB Nagar then probably a visit to Mama's Buoi will be a good decision.Its at the end of the hudson lane easily spotable. Ambiance is done up very well but the music they play is a bit loud.I was with my cousions and we dined in here. We order Butter Chicken Pizza Bun (something really unique and really tasty), Mozzarell sticks which were ok as I would have loved to have a bit more of cheese in it. Crispy Honey Chicken which was good. Chicken Lasagna which again was prepared well and latstly we ordered tandoori platter which was disappointing. As per me the North Indian is not that good but the rest of the items are really well prepared."
1444,"The fooooood is delicious. I went there in winters so it was easy then to sit on terrace but nowadays nobody can sit on the rooftop due to heat but the rooftop is pretty cool and spacious, especially in night it look soo amazing. The indoor seating is pretty fine. I loved the food here and would want to visit again.Undoubtedly the food here is better than the overhyped QD's and ricos. Highly recommended in GTB Nagar."
1445,"Located near to my dwelling place, Hudson lane has always been a dear spot for me and as and when a new cafe pops up, I am in. Mama's buoi was a planned visit and ended up with an below average experience. went there with 6 of my friends , the food is really nice and menu consists of array of things from shakes to yummy food ! the bad part was service, we were so disapoointed that we asked the waiter to call the manager , to which he didn't respond. the experience could have been better if service was good."
1446,Had heard a lot about this place.... went there twice only to return disappointed both the times... service was below average probably due to the rush hours... the serving men had no clue about the dishes stated on the menu... poor food quality and taste... won't recommend the place to anyone 
1447,"It is definitely one of the most happening places in Hudson Lane. The ambience is chill with good seating. I would anytime prefer their open seating as its pretty cool upstairs. I loved the butter chicken pizza bun, it was huge & full of mozzarella cheese and butter chicken. Drums of heaven were nicely tossed in schezwan sauce. The fried mozzarella sticks were okayish. I expected more molten cheese in it and they tasted a little bland too. I found the sheeshas to be very reasonable for the quality they are providing. Their fruit sangria is a speciality, very refreshing and fruity in taste. The chocolate and nut shake looked so pretty and thick that it took me really long to finish it off...read more"
1448,"Disappointed. That's a one word summation of Mamas Buoi. Mama's buoi is located at the end of the hudson lane,  easy to find. There are two levels on 3rd floor, one sort of open roof. On the second floor, the seats are decided by waiters, we were refused empty tables, saying that they were reserved. Funny when half tables are empty. Anyways we took a table at 1st floor. First thing which hits you is extremly loud music. In fact  I had to get the music turned down, it was so deafening. Restaurant deco is the mismatch style with exposed pipings, hammers for door knobs, contraptions made out of steel pipes. Really done to death now.For food we ordered crispy honey chicken for starters, pan...read more"
1449,"I went to mama's buoi on a Monday and the place was almsot empty. I was not at all satisfied with the service . The waiters were having their own conversation while we were calling them , the service was not promt, The food was average and way too authentic for my taste. The only good thing about the cafe was that seats were appropriately spaced. All in all , I had a below average experience at this place."

The fish fingers were oily and I couldn't taste the fish in there because of that.

1452,Mama's buoi is a perfect place to celebrate your big events since the place is really spacious. Been to this cafe twice or thrice by now and had mixed experiences. During my first visit I abslolutely loved the food and service which didn't turn out to be the case later. Service was reallyyy slow the next time I visited also food quality didn't match my expectations. I personally love their fruit sangria (Mama's sangria) and would recommend everyone to try it. Overall quite a good place to hang out with friends. :)
1453,"After hearing alot I visited this place in North campus.We ordered ""X on the beach sheesha"" I've tried many flavours but this one was very bad. So till the time hukka came we decided our food order and end up ordering ""mezze platter with pita bread"" and chili pizza. Both were great in taste. We also ordered sangria and ginger lemon ice tea. Sangria was nice.Ambiance is good. The seating arrangement on terrace and down both are really good.Service was slow. Price wise it's ok. "
1454,"Loved the food. Absolutely delicious. We ordered mama's buoi signature non veg pizza, punjabi something pizza along with mazze platter, thai curry and rice, hakka noodles and non veg nachos - every thing was just finger lickingThe service was quick (even though place was house full) and friendly. Live music was okish, it took a while to sync in."
1455,"Located in the GTB nagar , finally tried this grooving place known for its awesome food and drinks. We ordered for virgin Sangria , chocolate brownie shake , coriander Momos , veggie pizza , and Alfredo pasta. Everything was superb. I loved this place. Coming back soon."
1456,Had heard a lot about this place and found good ratings on Zomato as well but I found this place pretty average. Nothing great. Maybe because no live performance was going on when I visited. Food and ambience both were average. Prices are on a higher end as compared to other restaurants in the area.

Veg platter include almost every snack you can try there and it was worth having. Masaala Chicken tikka pizza had that small chicken chunks. Their new range of summer coolers and shakes are just amazing. Must try--chicken Tikka pizza-go green -big burger-chilli potato"

Order it with a coolant or delicious shake and you're good to go! Coming to the star dish of our lunch, 'Thin crust chilli chicken pizza'.

The ambience lifts you up to order one more of everything you choose.I would rate the breakfast menu of Mama's among the best I've ever seen with regards to the assortments it offers.Another notable or rather enjoyable quality of the place is the wide range of salads it has.Since, it is located in an area where the Sheesha is light on your pocket, the place would make you flow through time. You would actually enjoy the music of the place with the dishes and the spend a memorable time.Presentation of food items has been carefully decided keeping in sync the atmosphere of the lounge."
1473,"DO NOT TOUCH THE INNOCENT GIRL(in the mocktail section), just don't.  Other than that they serve perfectly crispy spring rolls and the pasta is also decent.The ambience is good compared to the other cafes in GTB but sadly Mama's buoi serve alcohol only on friday, saturday and sunday. mama doesn't allow them to pour beer on weekdays."

The waiters were a little unaware of their menu so all these little things did spoil the mood. Now let's come to the food üç≤, I ordered 1.dahi kebab 2. Chilli pizza and a drink to go with it.

Shakes here are average but coolers, they are must try. You would certainly fell in love with coolers.In dinner I had Traditional Greek salad...read more"
1487,"Tucked away in a little corner of every students favorite hub , Mama‚Äôs Boui is the cherry that was missing on top. Wether we talk in terms of food , presentation , ambience , everything was exceptional.  It is a little distant from the main hustle bustle of that area , tucked away in a corner , but that is one of the reasons as to why this place stands out of the crowd . The entry was a little disappointing and misleading but the food and the ambience made up for it .  We started off by devouring some hot and sour soup and nearly burnt our throats as we gobbled up every last bit of it . The soup had been conscientiously cooked and  served in a nice manner . Next we tried the...read more"
1488,Hudson Lane has never failed to surprise me.  A recent talk of the town is Mumma's Buoi . This place has a nice sitting on the terrace which elates the mood instantly. The ambience is quite chic and modern. This place has a youth vibrancy which I liked the most. Quite reasonable on pockets this place can be visited for sure.The food here had some variants apart from the usual . The scrambled egg with chicken was certainly classic and the texture was great. Dahi ke kebabs was so flavourful ans soft that it melted in mouth. The service was prompt and the staff was very courteous and informed. One of the best in town to hangout with pals.
1489,A duplex building restaurant in a crowded place like GTB Nagar close to North Campus is a delighful place to have fun with friends. Service is awesome with the delicious food. Little bit expensive on the pocket if you are drinking alcohol but you can enjoy the LIVE music out here on the roof as well as the DJ in the middle. Must recommend.
1490,"From exquisite interiors to fingerlicking delicacies, Mama's Buoi surely one of the best places in the town. It has been marked on my to-visit list from more than 6 months and finally I visited them with great excitement.The moment I entered, I was head over heels with their exclusive wooden interiors. From their drinks menu they suggested me to order Mama's Buoi special and double chocolate shake. Their shakes menu is just perfect as per the increasing heat in Delhi. They are soul satisfying and inevitably delicious. You just can't stoo yourself after gulping a sip.Their food menu is impressive. From Indian mains to Italian perfection, everything will attract you. Being a huge mezze...read more"

1492,"My new favorite in the famous gtb nagar lane. It is one of the places where you will love almost everything. From interiors to food to cocktails. Multi storeyed cafe with a huge and a lovely terrace. And some dedicated lounges for a private party. Ordered a few drinks and some appraisers and loved them all. Salted caramel shake, lovely lemonade and a melon drink were so refreshing. In the food, my favorite was grilled fish in lemon butter sauce. If you like Lebanese, go for the mezze platter. Pizza lovers can go for chicken tikka pizza. Craving for something creamy? Order the chicken stroganoff. The place won't disappoint you. Go there and have a good time. "

1503,"It's not long ago that my I fell in love with GTB Nagar when I first visited this place. Though, whole area is a bit congested, but it is a paradise for all the food lovers out here. Every time I am here, I see a new restaurant popping up. And that is a good thing because that will mean another new place to try.It was Mama's Buoi this time. Mamas Buoi- Future Ladies Man made me tickle a bit. This is visible written on the wall and also on the back of the T-Shirt worn by each and every server there.

I didn't expected it to be this good to be honest. Anyone who is going to this place must try their White Sauce Pasta.In Drinks, I tried Oreo Shake which was extra sweet and taste of Whipped Cream was also there.

But its little costly .Epicurean's World "
1506,"Good place, awesome ambience, the place is divided in two parts. One for enjoying dinner with frnds or family other is Terrance which is basically for drinks, hookahs and smoke. The waiting staff is helpful and friendly. Recommendations include coolers, lasagna ,chilly chicken, salad, sweet corn and commissioner hookah."

1511,Pathetic place Seriously I don't know how this place has such high ratings whereas it deserves to be at 1-2 stars marks.Food here was average but the service and ambience was pathetic.
1512,"Place is okay... when we visited sadly not all AC were working. It was hot. Interior, ambience and service was good. Staff were supportive and friendly. I personally didn't like everything we ordered to eat. Mushroom soup was awesome though. Music was bit loud...difficult to communicate.Things can be made better. Good food at reasonable price can cover up for all small difficulties/ issues. As there is lot of competition in the area....advised to keep up to the standards."
1513,"Hudson never fails to surprise you when it comes to offering your choice of cafes according to your moods.¬†This place is basically a party place especially in winters when the weather is good and you can enjoy its terrace while its indoor sitting is not so much appealing and very crowded all the time.Servers are polite and will try their best to cater to your needs and sitting preferences. They are well versed with the dishes and arrival time is real quick.One of the best things in this place is its shakes and drinks which are simply amazing.

1514,Ambience is cool.My favourite Drums of heaven are extremely good.French fries with toofani chicken was okay and club sandwich with chicken was quite good.Can try these things will make u happy food soul.And hookah lovers do visit this place.
1515,"A friend recommended me this place. It's located in the third floor, probably at the end of the road full of cafes in Hudson Lane. The interior is good and gives you a vibe of a pub. I did not like the constant smoke in the environment (yes they serve hukka).Coming to food, we ordered a pizza and 4 cheese sandwich. They both were pretty good. Sandwiches were a bit different than others and are a must try."
1516,Wow...what a unique name they ...and i visit there just for there name and belive me they just make me remember  mother ls food..because my mom is chef...and they make same as my mom use to make...this place is very good good in all way ...ambians was nice...staff was very friendly...love to come again..
1517,"I visited Mama's Buoi on a friday evening. We headed to the terrace section which is the best part about this place. It was packed and we had to wait for 15-20 minutes to get a table. They have a two floor seating, one on the 3rd floor and then the terrace. 3rd floor has a an average ambience. But their terrace section is gorgeous and has a two level sitting. Their dim lit ambience and live singers make it an apt place to spend a lively evening with friends. You get a HKV terrace feel in GTB nagar. Impressed with the ambience, we had high hopes from food and service too. But they dint live upto my expectations. Service was too slow and food too was just average. We ordered chicken...read more"

1519,"Thought of enjoying the good weather in gtb nagar at a roof top cafe so here we were at the Mama's Buoi Cafe. Such a nice terrace of this place with a great ambience with a very comfortable seating. Very well designed rooftop with non stop mist making the weather more enjoyable. So we ordered a Non Veg Pizza with Veg Red Sauce Pasta, a portion of Garlic breadwith 3 special Mocktails ( Cucumber mocktails tossed with in house spices , Litchi Mocktail with a blend mix of ginger, A suitable orange mocktail ) The size of the pizza will serve 4 very easily and the presentation of all the servings were very good.

1521,"I guess the best in Hudson lanes!! I wonder why I went here so late. Its big and beautiful the terrace is quite pleasant but it's jam packed. Even at 8:00 in the night I was surprised to see that. After waiting for some time we finally got a seat at the terrace it was good cause it rained and all. For the food, it was well prepared and nicely presented. The spicy chicken dumplings are really good. We usually don't get thin coated(like not really thin) dumplings here so that was good.The Peri Peri chicken was more of chicken tikka I guess. But it tasted good, I was happy to see that the chicken was soft,tender and not chewy and hard. If you're a vegetarian you must try the mushroom kebabs...read more"
1522,"Lovely place ... food is very good. We ordered chicken malai tikka and peri peri tikka, well cooked and chicken was very soft and tender. The pizza and pasta were also very nice. The ambience of the place is very good though a little congusted in terms of space. The only negativity was the foul smell at the top floor. Had an amazing time , lovely music and live singing."
1523,"Worst cafe ever . Had pre booked for 11 people and went with the family there,but they could not provide us the seat as they had overbooked .Also the rooftop was unhygenic and the manager did not cared about the customers.Had to leave without having food.Will never go back there and won't recommend it to anybody"
1524,"I would say this place is seriously over hyped.Rude and arrogant staff from very onset,if you call to reserve table then  only you can make out louzy attitude.After that also i decided to go ahead with my plan and to my surprise after reaching there you are greeted by whole bunch of unprofessionals running this place who shows what exactly hospitality industry should not be.Food is nothing to write about and all things ordered were cold or tasteless.Please avoid this place uf you really wanna get kick for your money theb thers are lot better places in same locality."
1525,"This cafe has now become charm of Hudson lane, everyone is visiting this place.My visit to this place wasn't satisfactory.Drinks here are totally worth, they are amazingly done.We ordered for college mojito and laughing melon , both were a pleasure to have.Disappointment was quesadilla, It was soggy.Also I found the place on expensive side, INR 800 for such a small order.

1526,"Visited dis place once..... The moment u stand outside mama's buoi the hookah smells fill up ur nose....the food is average here.. Tries corn salt n pepper, honey chilli chicken, tiranga Chap, chicken malai tikka... Nothing amazed us... It was an average preparation... The music was bit loud... The major drawback of this place.. Maybe because of which we'll never visit dis place again is dey allow cigarette smoking inside which made us difficult to breathe.....

1527,"Went there for lunch with my couple of friends.Ambience was good overall good music good decor . Ordered chicken sizzler , veg dumplings , pad Thai flat noodles and tobleron shake. Food was over all good nothing too special about it. Sizzler was better than the rest of the things. Expected pad Thai flat noodles to be more thai than Chinese though peanuts added a good flavour and texture to it.The chutney with the dumplings was better than the dumplings.Shake was not at ol tasting like tobleron.So overall a decent place to chill out."

1531,"So I went on to try on this place with my hopes high. Ofcourse a new cafe in Hudson is a must try, especially when you see a lot of check-ins for that place. But coming back absolutely disappointed was definitely not what I expected. This place really needs to be improvised. First of all there was nobody to assist us on which floor the cafe is located exactly. It took us 10 odd mins to figureout that. There are no directions mentioned. There is just one board on the tree outside the building which does not even mention the floor. As we entered, we realized that it's more of a hookah lounge than any other caf√©'s in Hudson lane. Nevertheless, the food and the ambience disappointed us...read more"

So, now at first we asked the attendant downstairs which floor the restaurant was. Now, the job of this guy is to inform us whether tables are free or not but no he tells us to climb those stairs. I don't remember if they had a lift or not but at that time, the guy said we had to just take the stairs. So me and my friends climb up those floors and stand on the doorway.

People speak about this place offering really good sheesha but personally my experience was not exotic, the flavour was completely off on its arrival and on complaining about the same to the waiter rather than getting a beter service, i was asked and questioned about whether i know relatively anything about the sheesha, as the hukka guy said, ""Sir hukka aise hi hota hai, apko flavor ka idea nahi hai!""

They have a well stocked bar and host pretty cool sufi/live music nights on many nights.It is always (yes, always!) filled to the brim so consider booking a table, especially if you are going in the night. The management and staff is very friendly.They have a beautiful roof-top. I have never actually sat indoors there cuz the roof-top is so good.Food is also quite nice. You should go here, you really should. "
1541,"Simply hated the place and staff. It is somewhere on the 3rd floor where there is one lift installed to enter the place. I visited there with a friend around 2-3 pm on a weekday. You really need to push the door hard to enter the place, and all you find is the staff grinning at you. There was no table for two so one of the staff members asked us to sit on the table for four. On their own they brought us 2 glasses of water poured from a bisleri bottle. Before we drank it they made us stand and asked us to wait near the reception. Meanwhile all of them were smirking.

1547,Went there on a birthday treat. Had abundant of tasteless food. Cold coffee tasted like ice cream shake with lots of sugar. Chicken lollipop was undercooked and hence inedible. Mushroom oizza was good. Jalepino bread was average. Mocktails like innocent girl etc tasted very average. Murg malai tikka was alright. Paneer butter masala and paneer tikka tasted the worst along with the chapati. Dal fry was average at best. Will probably never go again here!! The staff was not impolite but it felt like they were mentally retarded.
1548,"Perfect Place to hangout or organize a party at. It serves you with amazing food, Amazing sheesha and Great shakes. A friendly staff that will help you make feel comfortable and will be at your service with their heart. Perfect lighting and Has a lift to help you climb the 3 levels to reach here. Pocket Friendly Menu And Every bite of it is worth it.Special Meantion for The manager,idk the name but he tries his best too, to make his customers have a good time there by ensuring that everythings fine. Gives you a parking space as well for 6-8 cars or so. The best place in its surrounding area. Hope to see you open up a branch in CP someday."
1549,"I absolutely loved this place.  Great ambience, quality food and great service. The best pick were the fried mushrooms, absolutely delicious and totally worth!

1560,Awesome food nice place in gtb and services are really very good. Food is very good and delicious. Services by manager panjak is also very good.
1561,very much overrated.the food does not taste good at all.ambiance is just ordinary like most of the cafes.i did not find anything new with cafe.music is very boring and poor choice of speakers.¬†the staff is very good no doubt and service is pretty good even on a busy nightfood rating : 2ambiance rating : 2service ratings : 3overall ratings : 2.5
1562,"Average place for sheesha in Gtb nagar.We ordered sangria,mama's boy special JD infused burger with was pretty satisfactory.They have really awful service as most of their staff is unaware of the dishes they serve.Ambience- 4Food- 4Service-1"
1563,Had an amazing experience! The ambience was vibrant enough to give you positive vibes! The Dirty chocolate shake  and dahi vada are must try. Chickens wings are only for die hard bbq lovers. The cherry on the cake was spring roll chocolate dessert. Its a 10/10 dish. Wouldn't love to visit the place again.
1564,One of the best place to visit in North Campus! It's ambience is really good and the food tastes really amazing as well which makes perfect it place to spend time! I would definitely recommend this place for you next visit!

1570,"Nice place with rooftop seating too, service was nice, food was pretty average for the price they quote in the menu. So we had vada Pav which wasn't exactly authentic but they were average, next we had a pizza which had the tough and hard crust didn't enjoy it that much, after that we had veg spring rolls which were the highlight of all they were crispy and had a sweet chilli dip with which complimented the spring rolls and lastly I had a laughing melon mocktail which was refreshing and had watermelon chunks in it. This place can definitely improve a little with food but the rest is was all pretty good. üëçüèº"

1573,"Wao feel good at this awesome place , nice interiors and extraordinary service crew specially I'm thankful to Mr Anand from the management for his courteous staff and hospitality.Team Mama's Buoi rock keep up the good work."
1574,it nice place for enjoy in hudson lane. service was good.hukkah was also gud. food was good. coordinating staff. there are long waiting que but managers are good they arrange table in 15 mins.
1575,WHAT A AMAZING PLACEYOU DONT FEEL YOU'RE AT HUDSON LANE ITS LIKE A LOUNGE IN C.P VERY GOOD FOOD LOTS OF MENU OPTION AND NICE EVENTS HELD HEREBEST PLACE IN NORTH DELHI. A BIT CROWDED RESERVATION NECESSARY.
1576,"We stopped here after walking by many times. It was pretty busy on a Thursday evening. We ordered a non veg platter,paneer butter masala and garlic naan. It came out sizzling and naan was warm and soft and flaky. The paneer butter masala was just decent.The ambiance isn't the brightest or best but we were glad we tried it once."
1577,"A decent place located at one end of the hudson lane. It has a nice ambience with great interiors. The place has seating areas on two floors the second one being open to sky. On our visit we ordered a veg cheese sandwich and a paneer tikka quesadilla. The taste and quantity was good. We also had a kiwi hukka which I didn't like much. Neither was it smooth nor was the smoke dense. Prices are average. It's just like any other lounge where you can go to hangout with friends, nothing extraordinary. "
1578,Mamas buoi is a decent looking place in the end of Vijay Nagar resteraunt and cafe alley! They are just average and usually you wouldn't really find yourself a seating here unless you have prebooked one! Overall-:Ambience- 3/5Food- 3/5Value For Money- 3/5Service-2/5
1579,"Terrible experience! The staff is so rude.. The place is decent and food is just about average. I'm sure there are so many other different cafes who offer way better food with amicable hospitality. The manager and the owner are incorporate, they hinted us to leave the spot, since, they had other people waiting to occupy that afresh...  such indecency showcased by mumma buoi's staff.. we're not done yet, and were presented the bill before even asking for it.. The staff with inappropriate behaviour hinting us to leave the spot and go so that new customers can take that space... they wanted us to rush through our drinks and wished we evacuate the place ASAP.. pathetic experience, I would...read more"
1580,"Spent some good enough time here while trying different food. Ordered garlic bread, Greek Salad & Death by chocolate. The food is average if you compare it with GTB standards. Ambience is decent, but had some bad experience with the staff. I went to this place after hearing a lot from some people but would not probably be visiting here again because of the service. Much better options are available in terms of everything. "
1581,The ambience and feel is good but the music is toooo loud. Not a very big cafe and music is too loud for the space. Staff is courteous and service is quick. Hookah did take some extra time and it wasn't even a nice one. Food is tasty. Overall it was an ok ok experience 
1582,Really bad experience dining here.1. Music was tooooo loud - couldn't hear the person sitting beside me. Told them several times to reduce the volume. The person incharge said he would - and he did  reduce the volume - for 10 seconds.2. Really average food. Thai curry was okay and poor quality rice. Pasta portion served was too less for a price of 300 rs 3. Too many mosquitoes.Never ever returning again to this mother's arrogant bouy 
1583,"Amazing ambience, Great food (Must try : Dahi Kebab), hospitable staff and quick service !Sheesha was good but they take time to serve it.Washrooms need a little check.:) :)"
1584,"Heard a lot about this cafe , so made up mind to visit this one. Considering the location the cafe is a much more differrent one than any other cafes in gtb nagar.  A place with great interiors and ambience.We ordered three dishes. The first one was melting moments . The name seemed attractive. This dish was plated beautifully. They were mozerrella cheese sticks with three different dips. I m a cheese lover , therefore i liked the dish. But they can work on it a bit more on this dish in accordance with its name. The dips were really yummy though .Secondly we ordered was a vegetable lasagna which was a spinach lasagna . It wss upto the mark . Then the third dish was mama's pizza. It  is...read more"
1585,"Been here for the first time and would love to visit again.Friendly and courteous staff. Food was served by Mr. Hitesh, he took care of all orders and was assigned just for our table and orders.We ordered Sangria, Innocent Girl(Best Strawberry Lemonade I had so Far), Tandoori Platter, Spanich Mushroom Lasagna(Nice, although not the best you get in North campus), Choco Shake (A shake to drool for) and Pan Kiwi Hookah(It was smooth and server changed coal time to time)The best part about Mama's Buoi is their ambience specially their upper terrace. Amazing view of north campus."
1586,"The place is amazing according to the hudson standards.Nice food, especially their double trouble  is mouth watering. I don't think there's any other place in hudson with such ambience and rooftop. The furniture on the rooftop is not clean though, and last time when i visited i think they have increased the prices."
1587,"This place is quite good and pocket friendly . The staff is kind and gentle and ambience is also good. The food is superb , specially the spring rolls that were quite crisp and crunchy. I had also tried thin crust chili pizza which was big enough . The drinks, Watermelon Lemon and College Mojito are quite refreshing and a must try here.Overall the experience was quite good and I would like to visit here again."
1588,"Mama's Buoy, one of the best places in hudson and north campus vicinity to have sheesha and a good time.First things first, its one of the only proper rooftop cafe's in hudson and has some amazing live music gigs on weekends at night.Coming to the food, the food at this place is good. Some of the dishes are quite nice and the pizza especially, they will even make a half and half pizza for you if you ask for it.They have a good variety of snacks and most of them are up to the mark.Their sheesha is amazing.Since its a hyped and a certainly pocket friendly place given the ambience they provide, its usually full and its recommended to take a reservation beforehand, specially if you are...read more"
1589,X on the beach hookah is recommended and so is Mamas Sangria. The place is never empty from what I've heard and seen. White sauce pasta is just okay. I wouldn't recommend. Good to hangout with friends. 
1590,"How this place is rated 3.9 is out of my mind. I read so many good reviews about this place so when i visited Hudson Lane this time i went here. A big and beautiful place spread across 3 floors, it has one of the better interiors of GTB Nagar area but this is a mess of a place..dirty tables and floor, the blue color of the sofas of their terrace has turned black..if you take a close look their terrace is one of the most unhygienic that one can encounter. To top it off, their staff is so confused..we are ordering something..they are serving us something else. Add in the the painfully slow service, taking hours to serve simple garlic breads loaded with jalapenos. We thought okay, food would...read more"
1591,The service was fast but the staaf was very rude. Sat on the rooftop. Hukkah was good too. Ambience-4/5Food-3.5/5Service-2/5Staff is a major disappointment. 
1592,Slow service.. experienced stale food. Oily vada Pao .. hukkah took 45 mins n came after we got tired and cancelled it.. no management of crowd .. when I refused to pay service charge I was asked by the waiter that we take the charges we have a board in d entry saying it .. so I had to pay but u have not earned it right .. this was my 1st visit.. disappointed üòî
1593,Went to this place with a friend of mine. Ambiance of the place is good but service and food tasted okayish. Also people who love hukkah and wana go for drinks will like this place much more than people who just want to hang out and have good food.We tried flowing items:Melting moments: These were fried mozerella cheese sticks served with dip but cheese tasted somewhat stale. I did not like this at all.Spicy chicken dimsums: This also did not taste good and would try not to order it if i am around for a next meal.Fried mushrooms tasted good and can be ordered. In drinks we tried fruit sangria and it tasted pretty okayish while dirty double chocolate shake tasted good.
1594,"Had to visit this place because of the kind of publicity it was gaining (positive one, of course!). Sunday done right here in the warmth of sun, while saying goodbye to winters. Cheesy fries: It has now become a ritual for me to order fries. Served with chili mayonnaise dip, fires were fresh and not soggy. Pita platter (NV)- it was fresh, served with pickled carrots and beetroot, and 4 different types of hummus. Garlic bread with cheese: how can one go wrong with this sumptuous dish. Made to perfection, with cheese flowing. Thai chicken salad: Extremely spicy!! It would have been better if it were a little less spicy but undoubtedly it was delicious! Totally loved its rooftop...read more"
1595,"After having a look on its interiors in some pictures uploaded on Zomato, I decided to visit this place. The place has good interiors , especially when we consider the location! It is really good. We ordered vegetable lasagne, mama's  pizza, and melting moments. Melting moments is a mozerella cheese stick platter served with three dips. The dips were very tasty, its plating was done nicely but the name of the dish is not justified. Otherwise it's a nice thing to have.Vegetable lasagne is a spinach lasagne and it was up to the mark. Then, pizza was good too , it has a good thin crust and has good vegetable toppings.Well I was in a mood to have a desert, so  ordered a red beauty desert...read more"
1596,"This place was much hyped i feel. The ambience is good but food is only satisfactory. I had great expectations from this place but it was not up to the mark.I ordered forPan fried noodles, chilli potato, and salt and pepper.Chilli potato and pan fried noodles were average but salt and pepper was not good. The oil swished in my mouth initially which was a big shutdown point for me.Drinks were good and the best was the sangria.The attendants are unaware of their own menu which should not be overlooked, except for the hukkah buoy who administer's his job well."
1597,visited the place with my family .. ambience is good ..food is all also good. but the worst was arrogance of waiter on 3rd floor with moustaches .. don't know the name .. but acting as he is only boss over there and had done a lot by offering a table .. after paying the bill have waited for 15 mins to get balance .. on which the guy argued that waiter was searching u ..on the contereory  to offer table to some guest  they make me stand near door and even after asking 4-5 times no one came back to return balance and i lastly went to cash counter to get my balance.   where this guy came and start arguing same.. coming to bill its highly overcharged  by taxes 10 % service charge  vat 20 %...read more

I was taken there recently with a friend of mine and I was quite happy to be there. The whole place remains busy and buzzing with youngsters throughout the day. Speaking of the food, the menu is quite large and pretty-much covers eveyrthing we youngsters are fond of. I had: 1. Honey Chilli Chicken: This was really delicious and made very well.

All in all decent.Then we come to the service. No issues here too.For food we ordered dirty double chocolate shake. That was the best one we had in Hudson lane in a very long time.

And I knew that this place is not hygienic AT ALL. You can't do with great food if you don't really care about hygiene. FOR ME. It's a NO NO for this place. GROSS "

1644,Worst food ever No water at the time of visit Card machine not working To the MAMAS Buoi red alert Smelly glassy Unhyginic visitLevy service charge as well were the service was too poorVisitor book was not available for the feedback 
1645,Worst experience and i will suggest my friends and others not to visit this place ever. Reasons are..:-1- Waiter was chewing pan masala(Gutka) on duty...he was unable to speak...2- They serve Hooka drinks and food stuff at once..3- Food was not tasty at all...we placed order for peri peri chicken..which was OK but arabitta pasta was not good.4- And finally the bill...and the way they gave bill was as similar as dhaba wala bhaiya gives bill to their customers..
1646,"With so many cafes already placed in GTB Nagar; how can one chose their favourite? Well, after my recent visit to Mama's Buoi; I have a favourite for sure. Enjoy the inside seating or fall in love with their airy terrace with a Huge seating space, wooden decor, live music (selected nights); The Bar; and enjoy the Hukkahs, Food and Drinks these guys serve!¬†I began my dining with a Lindtt Shake, sipped a friend's Dirty Double; hopped to their Virgin Mojito and finally settled down with Sangria.

1647,"Oh man what a great place. Amazing food, amazing ambience, service and what not. Loved the whole experience.In food we tried a lot of stuff but chicken momos and chocolate shake were the best onesA must visit for everyone"
1648,"I guess this is one of the biggest cafes of hudson lane in terms of space and menu items unlike small sized eating hubs in GTB nagar.It has a multi-cuisine menu with a bar. The interiors are too pleasing to the eyes with a wooden touch.The most important aspect of infra was a huge-sized roof which is a superb hangout space for youngsters.I had regular dishes in starters chilli potato, White sauce pasta, Veg momos, Sandwich ‚Äì these were ‚Äúat par‚Äù of the other cafes in north campus.But the burger was amazing due to its huge size and luscious mixture filling.Coming on to the deserts , the ‚ÄúToblerone shake‚Äù was quite appreciable and other shakes such as kitkat, oreo and...read more"
1649,The ambience and the music of this place is amazing. We had a great time sitting in the rooftop section of the resturant. The food was good too. The only thing missing was alcohol but nevertheless it is a good place to chill with your friends.
1650,"The best place to chill and relax in Hudson Lane. With different themed 3 floors, ¬†this outlet is unique in its own way. ¬†From food, to service to ambiance, everything is PERFECT.Cant get enough of it!¬†MUST VISIT"
1651,"Undoubtedly, the next big place in North Campus. This place is way out of league of any other cafe in the area. A place with a chic decor, amazing rooftop, lipsmacking food and to accompany some live music makes this cafe stand out in the GTB hub. Anything your order is scrumptious that you will desire to order more. Definitely not a place to be visited just once. They serve some amazing Hukka's as well. I tried their 'Maa Da Ladla' and Commissioner Hukka and both were really good.

1652,"The trendiest go-to place in Hudson Lane these days is Mama's Buoi. With beautifully architectured floor and a terrace, Mama's Buoi definitely takes a 10 on 10 when it comes to ambience. We were 9 people and ordered a Hookah, Dirty Double Shake, Chilly Paneer (recommended), White Sauce Pasta, Virgin Mojito and Death by Chocolate Sundae (recommended). Chilly Paneer and the Sundae tasted delicious but except that everything seemed quite average. This place's Hookah is of course famous but really expensive as well. All this cost us 1850 which was too much for a cafe at Hudson. Another turn off is the service which is too slow even when there's no crowd as such.I'd recommend a one time visit...read more"

1654,"New Sheriff in Town, a not so old cafe in Hudson Lane, is taking the town by storm.With rustic interior, both indoor and terrace seating and food that tastes absolutely fantastic, this place should be next on your bucket list.They have a pretty versatile menu which is nominally priced which will make you want to have everything in one go üòç . Also their burgers are something among the popular mentions. They serve Hookah(sheesha) too, the good thing being that the people handling the hookah are pretty knowledgeable and help you customize your order.Apart from everything already mentioned, what takes the cake is that they also have a 'Mobile App' which involves features right from...read more"
1655,This place is great.The food is cheap. Can be a a bit of a wait if they are super packed but all around good atmosphere. Great spot for lunch if you want to change things up. All around great establishment.
1656,We went to the roof top and the ambiance was good . They also provided hucca and it was really awesome. The place is so cost efficient for parties. The burger and chicken 65 was class apart. But a bit disappointed with the pizza and fish fingers. Apart from that everything was extremely good
1657,"Ambience - Interiors are good. They also have terrace seating. All hookah lovers come there.The room was full of smoke. Ideally they should restrict hookah to terrace area.Music - It was very very loud. They should play it at a volume which can make the person feels relaxed. Infact we were not able to conversate properly.If playing music at very loud volume, then there should be a dance floor.Service - Very poor. Infact worst service ever experienced in any restaurant.Food - Okay. Tried their special chicken pizza. That was good. We also tried perry perry chicken tikka and drums of heaven. Perry perry chicken was good. But drums of heaven was okayish and was not properly cooked....read more"
1658,"This place is a must check out when around.The highlights is are the music and their Rooftop and super rooftop as well.So basically it is a three floor sitting system.Their Tringa soya chap is a must try which is three flavours in one plate pudina,achari and malai.Their mini burgers are the cuties.Their Sangria is a must try.They had a valentine's theme were in everything thing was of heart shape.But the one thing here is that their staff is pretty slow."
1659,"I have been told about this place as one of the best in hudson lane! So I thought to visit it today itself...But honestly I did not find it so good to be super excited about it. I would like to share my first ever experience over this place. Firstly, red sauce pasta was average, non veg nachos were a great disappointment as the chicken pieces were too cold and the dip (Mayo) was too cold as ice, veg dip sum were over boiled and tasted very bad, mama sangria was good.Secondly, service was okay.& Lastly, staff was not so good (or in other words looked quite irritated while taking order and arriving as well)In all my experience at mama's buoi was huge disappointment, not thinking to come...read more"
1660,"One of the top cafes in Hudson Lane. Offers great experience with the live music performances. The rooftop offers a great view and is secluded from the noise of city life. The service is prompt and the management is courteous. The food is generous in quality and quantity. Had blueberry date shake, melting moments, veg pizza and burger. Every dish leaves you craving for more.Kudos to the management to serve out a premium cafe experience at such an affordable price."
1661,"Good food. Amazing live music. They need to work on service. Though overall nice experience. It's worth spending good time with friends I like the place, shall give it a shot"
1662,"A wonderful little cafe on Hudson lane. Unlike all the other cafes this one was quite spacious and had natural sunlight coming in through the windows.We visited the place during the day and still it was packed with people. The music selection is perfect to dance on and the service was impeccable.For drinks we had a toblerone and coffee shake, it was nice with a hit of chocolate and coffee, though it was a bit milky for our taste. I also had the virgin sangria which was nice and fruity a very refreshing fruit punch version of the sangria.For starters i had the chicken dumplings which were absolutely amazing. Succulent chicken and very nice chilli dip along with it.We also had the...read more"
1663,"This is a culmination of four visits to this place.This is one place which ia undoubtedly the best in the area. A place in hudson area serving liquor, has some chic decor and has live music with such a cool terrace is something amazing. This place has everything that is desirable that too at good rates.Well the food here is something which can't be ignored.I've tried a lot here and everything i must say was good. There was nothing i didn't like. What we ordered:1. Honey chilli potato- Crispy potatoes and perfect flavour. This was everything i desired for.2. Malai chaap- I loved it to bits.

1664,Food is good but the ambiance is pathetic as we requested several times to the manager and the dj to turn volume low but even after 4-5 requests they just turned volume at more higher pitch.. if you love to get headache with food must visit this cafe
1665,"One of the most awesome eateries or i must say, cafe at North Campus with a chic decor and wonderful terrace seating. What is more amazing is the live music¬†at this place from wednesday to saturday, that holds the crowd and makes them groove!! moreover, even if there is no live music, this place's sound tracklist is so cool that you will sing along with biting the yummilicious food.For starters, i recommend their Mezze Platter, Galouti Kabab and Peri peri fish tikka!For the main course, highlighly recommend their lasagne and pizzas!!In desserts, Death By Chocolate is the ultimate choice!!If you are a milkshake lover, then this place will spoil u for superb choices. However, if not...read more"
1666,"Great ambience with delicious food. The terrace is well made and well maintained as well. The staff directs you with everything, the service is little slow and the hookah is bit expensive but overall a must visit place for partying in North Delhi. They also have sufi nights and such events which make it more attractive."
1667,"I had been hearing all the amazing things about this newly opened cafe in the hub of Hudson lane and ever since I was planning to check this place out. So on a Saturday evening I visited this place and the moment I stepped inside this rooftop cafe I was already in love with this place as I got such a perfect romantic seating arrangement from where I could watch the sunset. It was something close to a perfect. I ordered one coffee toblerone shake and one big buddy burger, stuffed mushrooms and mixed sauce spaghetti.The shake was like big liquid toblerone in my mouth, on point and the big buddy was actually very huge one could never have it all in one bite and the stuffed mushrooms were...read more"
1668,Finally a decent place in Hudson lane with terrace.Surprisingly with a decent crowd too! Rates a pocket friendly Sheesha is amazing But the waiters are not educated about the menu Like if you ask the speciality they'll just say 'chicken tikka lelo' Food is average Service is fine Also alcohol is served only on weekends I guess. A must visit if you're in north delhi 
1669,"Ambience and Crowd is what I give it a 4. Food quality and taste requires improvements. Taste is not good and a lot of changes are required.Overall it is a good budget place with good surroundings in G.T.B. Nagar. Interiors and rooftop are add on to go.Hookah is also a bit boring as required a frequent update by waiter. Near by has better options but still I would say, it is a must try."
1670,Good place to be at. Terrace is lively.Went there on Saturday night. The Sufi night and the dhol with dj both were amazing. Food : 4Ambiance : 3Service :4.5Value for money : 2.5 (as it's highly priced according to gtb sort of area. Ain't that cp). üëçüèª
1671,"Going by all the word of mouth appreciation about the restaurant, a pitstop at hudson called for a tricky trial. Since it is winters, we took an open terrace table.As to the set up expectations, the place is a well around average and the food is just upto the mark. The presentation takes a few extra points, food otherwise is good enough. Anyone looking for an terrace seating in that area, here's your call!Keep up the good work! :)"
1672,"Visited this cafe with 4 friends. Located on third floor adjacent to NDPL office with roof. Cafe is spacious but smoke of hookah makes it a little suffocating. Music is bit loud but songs were good. We ordered cheese garlic bread, vegetable pizza, chilly mushroom, mushroom tikka, blueberry kheer and salty lime soda. Quantity and taste of garlic bread and pizza were good but chilly mushroom and mushroom tikka had less servings. Quantity of blueberry kheer was equivalent to quantity of 500 and 2000 notes as on 9th November. Lime soda was so sour and salty that we had to get it replaced. Staff wasn't courteous enough. Their card machine wasn't working so had to pay through cash. Didn't feel...read more"
1673,Worst service and food in my life have attended my friends birthday party. All waiter's are confused to attending us we called every time but they ignored. Food presentation and quality also not up to the mark. I never suggest to any one
1674,"So went there on a saturday night at 9:15 PM . 75% restaurant was empty with reserved signs and on enquiring about that they said that they had bookings till 9:30 and apparently all of the remaining reserved seat customers had to come in 15 mins. It was clearly an area reserved for ladies or couples maybe but they should have told us that. It was really offensive and rude when a group of girls was given table without reservation who came after us. So üò§üò§üò§. Manager was absent minded , didn't told us about terrace as well.They are serving alcohol without menu with their own price and charging service tax also on that. Will never visit this restaurant ever again .!One satisfied...read more"
1675,First when we entered ambience was nice .. waiter came after 10min to handover food menu ... after we order again we waited for 20min .. first they served very salty food ... and then after 10min they made it better ... i would say very poor service and taste was very ordinary ... plus waiters were very rude .. overall very bad experience 
1676,"Worst Hookah, Poor Service! Never Again! No coordination between their employees, i ordered vanilla pan but they served something else and refused to change! I don't think I'll visit again here! "

1678,"Ambience: 4/5Food quality: 4/5Food quantity: 4/5Pricing: DecentAn eccentric name and doing complete justice to its name is the ambience of the place. Located in a deep corner of Hudson Lane in GTB nagar, is this quirky cafe. The decor has been given a funky look to entice the younger crowd. Being in a College area, their main target of guests are the college goers only. However the the space has been allocated in a way to regale all the groups of people of all shapes and sizes :pThe place is on the 3rd floor with a terrace area over it and a small rooftop on the terrace. Starting from the best part, the rooftop is the most amazing section giving a spectacular view while dining....read more"

1680,Best of all cafe's ! Food is amazingle tasty ! Ambience is sobar at the day time and classy at nights üòçServices are also good. Owners as well treats you best..  One best cafe to be visited in hudsone lane Not one time visit .. you can try this daily 
1681,The Food is really good and tasty... Its rooftop is its highlight... Its Beautiful... Their mocktails are very refreshing... lovely place to hangout with friends... 
1682,food sucked big time! waiters didn't know the good dishes of their own cafe...don't go if you like good food! even the ambience wasn't that great... spezia bistro is much much better..
1683,"Heard a lot of positive reviews from friend and finally visited the place. The ambience of the place automatically turns on the party mode in u. The rooftop sitting is ultimate. The quality and quantity of food and the service is amazing.We ordered :Food -1. Fish Fingers2. Achari Paneer Tikka3. Veg Spring Roll4. Chilli Mushroom5. Dahi k Kabab6. Veg Quesedalia7. Mutton Kabab8. Chilly Chicken9. Peri Peri Fish Tikka10. Chicken Lasagne Drinks - Dirty Double (one of the best shakes I have ever had), ozzzzy jumble (very refreshing and soothing mocktail), laughing melon (A MUST IF U LOVE WATERMELON FLAVOR) n their special sangria... Sheesha is also good at the place"
1684,"One of the worst place visits that this cafe would give anyone , sheesha wasn't upto the mark and neither does the food. The taste was bearable but ain't too great. Apart from that, this place gives you food in very little quantities within not so reasonable prices.Never visiting again, it's a flop.1/2 over 5 stars. Hardly!The staff doesn't know the orders and North campus definitely has greater and better places than this overrated cafe."
1685,The only thing worse than their hookah is their service.I'd write a long review but getting the food on the table is a big hassle here. Average pizza and unusually long time to get the bill seems to be a specialty (seriously took me 20 minutes to get the bill)Ambience inside is suffocating and finding a table in the open is harder than finding nemo. P.S- You're forced to pay service charge no matter how many times you tell them to remove it. Never visiting this place again. Thank you Mama's buoi for a complete crap experience and wasting my time and money.

1688,Big spacious but while attending a gig of my close friend the place got over crowded. The quantity of the food is very less as compared to the prices. Ordered malai chicken tikka it wasn't roasted properly. Tried complaining 3-4 times but no one responded. A place for hukkah lover. 
1689,nice service & food@Thnx pankaj gupta..for perfect service.The cafe is comparatively big to other places and interior is also fab.*Anyways. Going to the food. Completely impressed at the first visit itself*
1690,"For people seeking good taste please this is not the place. The place has hookas but no separate section for non hookah people. Sitting is chaotic and service men are confused. The food was awful and not worth the money paid. Too expensive for bad food.We ordered tiranga chaap which did not taste well at all... the seasoning gravy all was not well with dish, a mama signature pizza, a decent pizza but I have had better, a bb surprise burger with burned chicken pieces, a laughing melon which was decent while a strawberry blueberry and dates smoothie which was nothing but strawberry shake.Overall experience with serving, food taste was really bad."

1694,"The service is terribleWe ordered a lot of food, but the problem occurred when he brought the burgers.Our order included two burgers, 1 was big bang theory and other was big belly burger (non vegetarian). What happened was that he gave the non vegetarian burger to me and my JAIN friends. After enquiring about it for almost 3 -4 times , they constantly told us that the burger was vegetarian. I even lifted the bun and asked him if it was vegetarian.So, they made this mistake, but what bugged me , was that they were so casual about it. They were not even sorry and also the waiters were constantly giggling. Now obviously we called for the manager, and to our surprise he wasn't even there....read more"

Firstly they gave chicken tikka instead of chicken malai tikka. Then they served the burgers. We asked the server which was veg or non-veg, he confidently replied that the big size burger was vegetarian. We doubted that as we had ordered the big non-veg burger however the size of that burger was smaller than the vegetarian one. We inquired 3 times but he confidently replied the same. After my Jain friend ate half of the burger he got to know about it. We complained about it but the server was unapologetic and the cashier said that...read more"

1702,In one word if I have to describe this place the word would be PATHETIC. But as per the mandate review should have been minimum of 140 characters. Food is not of that great taste as compared to other Husdon Lane cafes & service is again PATHETIC.

Keep up the good job.The only thing which created a hindrance is the music is too loud. "
1717,Had to wait for 15 - 20 mins. But that wait was nt worth it. The focus is more on hookah and drinks. If you are a hookah lover then this is the place to be. The smell of the hookah is evident the moment you enter their premises. Their quantity of food is less if we compare with the price they charge.Will nt recommend it.There are many cafes in hudson lane which are better nd pocket friendly. 
1718,Amazing place! Must go! Specially the band on Friday night... Was the best thing ever!!!! Excellent food and decor; thumbs up to the place! Will definitely visit many times again.
1719,"It's one of the best place I have been in Hudson lines. The bollywood and Sufi night live rocked the evening. Great food, awesome and vibrant ambience coupled with good hospitality. A place must visit, i am sure you will have no regrets. Another good point is that they have ample parking outside as well.Definately would like to visit this place again."
1720,"easy to reach lounge close to north campus! Has a soothing ambience, terrace sitting is much cooler n fab than indoor sitting beneath! Food is as good as its presentation is! Have Maya's collectable range of hukkahs in the house! "
1721,"My recent experience to this nearby young cafe didn't go down that well...the ambience & the decor was the only good thing about the place! The staff too lost, it took 10 mins for a staff to realise to take order, in loud music self dancing, coal changing bouncers, rude ppl didn't connect...food was average...but not a good choice if you have a class."
1722,This place didn't live upto my expectation. First of all the staff doesn't know anything about the menu. We asked them about a few dishes and they were completely clueless about what their was in the dish. Secondly food was jus average. I ordered chilly paneer quesadilla which was completely bland. It had no taste at all. My overall experience was nt good. 
1723,"This place simply rocks .... it is a perfectPlace to chill out with friends & have a gala time. Although the food is above average but still the hospitality & the ambience of the place compliments & covers this. It's a must go place on Wednesday, Saturday & Sundays."
1724,The most hyped resturaunt and the worst one in north campus... there is nothing special exept the interior..  even the chairs are not comfortable for eating.. hookah was ridiculous.. it was so bad.. even at home you can make a better one.. i had ordered cheese french fries and pizza bun in the food.. and that was the first time in my life i left the food on my table.. food was very third class... pizza bun was like pav bhaji with cheese.. and that to even a bad taste.. and the french fries of mcdonalds is way much better..Overall there are many much better cafe than mummas boi in that lane..  I will never recommend.. 
1725,"The place is really beautiful. The view from the roof top is just amazing. I was in awe of the interiors. One of the very few places that serve alcohol in the vicinity. So that's a major plus point. We had Alfredo pasta, mix veg coriander dimsums, melting moments- amazing and Veg platter. The veg platter has a great variety. They serve Afghani Achari paneer, soya chaap- tiranga, mushrooms. A couple of more things. The vibe of this place is just amazing! I love the music that they play. The crowd is good.  The hukka was also amazing! "
1726,"The food is simply amazing! Both non vegetarian and vegetarian, we had starters, shakes and Chinese. Biryani was great too.The ambience was good, sitting arrangements inside and terrace was perfect for a winter afternoon.There service was a little disappointing, the helping staff would come  late and  were lethargic.I would suggest get a prior reservation if you want to visit in evening or weekend.Must try place! "
1727,There ambience is good there staff is also polite but the main problem is that if u are planning to visit mummas Buoi on SATURDAY/SUNDAY then its a not a right decision as on weekend its fully packed thats good for the owners as they are earning quite well but on the other hand coustmers suffer as they will take minimum half an hour to make your order ready still they will serve you food which is not properly cooked.
1728,"I visited this place for a birthday party and I would say this is the amazing place when compared with other nearby cafes. The place has excellent ambience and I would say the rooftop seating was awesome and the music played makes it more lively. For starters I had Crispy chilly mushroom(quite good), Veg salt n pepper(not upto the mark) and dahi kebab( melted in mouth however chutney was embarrassing). For main course I had dal makhani , paneer butter masala both were great and quantity served were also good. The breads served especially missi roti was quite crispy. The double choco shake was also amazing . Overall a great experience. The staff was courteous and service was good as well."
1729,"Great ambience. Excellent service. Bhatti ka murgh, butter chicken and Blueberry kheer - All time favourites! My best corner in the cafe since we're regulars - the terrace seating on the top floor. "
1730,"Nice place to hang out specially the terrace area. Food is good , they have wide menu to choose from , very few places offer sheesha and alcohol in Hudson lane muma's buoi is one of those . People were enjoin  the live singing  event . One must visit this place cos it is different from other regular cafe of Hudson lane.  "
1731,"I have mixed feelings about this place. The ambience was nice on terrace lounge. The music was nice but I didn't liked the service, the food was not good enough, few dishes were too good but few were bad like literally bad. Even the drinks were colorful but faded it's colors with time so that goes the same with the service they offer."
1732,"To be frank... There service is pathetic. There are n no. Of cafes in Hudson lane, and after reading so much reviews we went there. Food is of minimal quality, service is very poor, quantity is less. They have a ample space, but they are not living upto the expectations. Maximum review you read about this cafe is fake. I liked the aura of this cafe, but not more than that. First you have to climb a mountain to reach your destination and than after placing your order you have to wait long a too long. Hudson lane is something unique compared to CP or Rajouri. Here, we expect things to be fast and enough to fill our stomach. And it let downs our expectations. We hope, they will work on there...read more"

1736,"Super amazing ambience, it doesn't look like any ordinary cafe of Hudson lane. Enjoyed their Sufi night today. Classy crowd! We order Punjabi chicken pizza- it had smoky chicken and veggies, it was so delicious, base was thin and crispy. Then we tried Phad Thai noodles - very tasty. Big disappointment was chicken wings as it tastes of only tomato even one of the dips tastes only tomato, other big disappointment was blueberry kheer - it was like ordinary kheer and could not get taste of blueberry in it and major disappointment is their service, extremely slow and staff is not well groomed, they can give you good revert even if you do not mess with them. But overall, it was a pleasant and...read more"
1737,I visited this place with my friends for a relaxing time. The place was just average and the food was not that good. Firstly there was feather in my drums of heaven and secondly there was hair in my honey chilli potato. My dishes were changed but the same disappointed me a bit. Hookah was good and the shakes and the drink was also nice. The staff was polite. I visited this one again and the service as well as the food was greatly improved. ü•Ç
1738,"Mama's Buoi is the latest entry to the never ending cluster of cafes in GTB Nagar (North Campus area), but surely stands out with new & refreshing feel. It has a great ambience.Food variety is good, has a terrace seating & serves sheesha. Visited recently & preferred sitting on the terrace which was already full with just a table vacant. But quickly moved indoor because of the sun directly into the eyes.Coming to the food & drinks, we ordered Mama's Signature Pizza, base was thin crust & was very good.Heard about their special Keema Pao, and wasn't disappointed after eating it.

Well as soonas we sat we started ordering and we ordered pizza e punjab, signature pizza, dahi ka kabab, chilli mushroom, chilli garlic noddles, fried rice, veg manchurian, virgin mojito, sangria. And trust everything that was served was beautiful and delicious. It was a delight to have dinner there. The  complaint I had was there was a fly in my mojito for which they apologized and got it replaced. Otherwise it was tasty and the staff was serving well and service was fast too. Loved it. But the...read more"
1740,"Worst service ever. Do not taste dimsums at all, shittiest dish ever tasted. Though some dishes were okay. Spring rolls are quite satisfying. In nutshell i wont ever come back to this place.Waiters are least interested in listening n they will not give you the review book if u ask them!!!"
1741,"Mama's buoi is a new addition in the family of Hudson lane cafes, although it's quite isolated from the others. It has three floors, one has indoor seating and other two are rooftops. I visited  this cafe on my birthday as one of my friends suggested it, so I ordered Alfredo pasta, signature pizza, baked nachos, virgin mojito and chocolate shake, all of which were totally worth it. I like the overall ambience, but service quality is quite average."
1742,"The name was spread like fire, being heard every here and now and so it took me to finally have a visit over there which got served well.The place is speread amongst two stories with an additional spacing spacing even above the rooftop area. 5 Points of FoodAlive:1. One of the most delicious chilly potatoes ever tried, the tangy and crisp combination was worth it.2. The rooftop area is way too pretty specially when the lights are turned on in the late evening hours.3. The pizza was crisp and thin crust with loaded toppings.4. The serving was delayed due to some reasons for which they apologized well.5. All in all a great setback from regular cafes over the area."
1743,One of the best place to hangout with friends in Hudson lane..The best part about them is they provide super awsme sheesha(specially-MAA DAA LAADLA flavour)...I ordered nachos and pasta as nachos was okay but pasta was very good...i was disappointed only because of slow service...otherwise everything is gr8...Food-4/5Ambience-5/5Service-3/5Value for money-4/5

For the food, Chicken Wings were spicy  and juicy, the Exotic Pizza was full of veggies with perfect crust. Hot Garlic Noodles were super yummy and the spring rolls were hot and crispy as they should be and the coriander dumplings were very tasty! Chicken tikka was something I wouldn't really recommend.

1746,Yestrday i was here......i must say great ambience...mocktails r too gud...but food disappoints...i ordered grilled fish which was tasteless  no salt no coating......hukka is amazing there.....and secondly waiters should ask to bring mineral or normal water....he straight away brings normal water which is not gud in this hspitality......else evithng is superb....
1747,I like their terrace seating.. It really gives you a different mood. The food and their service is really commendable. You must try their cocktails.. Also dont forget to try pizza and chilly chicken.
1748,A new entry into the hub of cafes of gtb Nagar.. quirky name & soo is the place.. food variety is almost same .. they serve sheesha as well.. ambience was nice & lively.. good playlist with good music... Ordered    chicken65 ..Which was very average but the Mama's signature pizza was good.. overall good experience .. recommended
1749,I didnt like this place at all. First things first. The crowd is not good. Food is not good. Overpriced. The indoor seating is still a better place to sit but the outdoor one sucks. 
1750,"Good music, amazing food and super amazing hosts, that's what Mama's Buoi is :-) A must go if you're a Delhiite, and a reason to visit Dehi if you're not :-)"
1751,"One of the New spots in North Campus, Mama's Buoi is the place. A little away from the hub of all the cafes because it's situated at one of the corners but a beautifully done cafe.. Super seating arrangements with a terrace seating too. Food being a plus one always with great portions. Must Try would be there Fish Pan Fried Noodles.. And would recommend their Desi menu too. "

1757,"3/5The best thing about the restaurant was its rooftop ambience and the interiors. I ordered for a pizza which was fine , a white sauce pasta which was almost staled and corn salt and pepper which tasted good. I aso ordered one a kit kat shake  which was chilled and tasty.Also, the mocktails  they offer doesn't live up to the expectations of your thirst. The service is fine. But the music there is too loud which was a bit unpleasant. -My experience of Mama's Buoi was just fine."
1758,"One of the crowded places in GTB nagar which serves good food. Despite the many food joints , this place is always crowded. They have two floors out of which the rooftop is amazingly infrastructured, walls having empty beer bottles. Coming to the food, we ordered virgin mojito, garlic breads, melting moments, dry manchurian, honey chilli potato and a chocolate shake which just overwhelmed us with its taste and service. We also ordered hukka which was correctly made and it the staff kept in mind of the satisfaction of the customers as they kept changing the coal without even us asking for it. Service is 5 on 5 Music played is very loud even during the day which i think they should keep...read more"
1759,Nice place and the ambience was good too. I had chicken tikka and chilly chicken pizza. Chilly chicken pizza was amazing and delicious but the chicken tikka was little dry but its good. I ordered virgin mojito. I think the prices of drinks are overhyped in terms of what they serve. Overall its a nice place to hangout!
1760,A gem in GTB nagar. Beautiful rooftop seating. Staff is very helpful and service is great. Food is refreshing. I ordered spicy cheese sandwich and afgani paneer tikka. Sandwich was as described.. 4 diffwrent layers of cheese.. great in taste. Ambience and interiors makes you feel very comfortable. Great for large groups too.

Mama's Buoi is a recommended stopover for foodies to savour the tastebuds with what they might have not relished before.The pocket friendly menu offers a wide variety under Continental, Indian, Italian; from quick bites, shakes, to smooties & what not. Try anything & it would be your favourite! The place has been divided onto two floors, additionally a machan. Enjoy live soothing artistic performance, sip a drink & munch the snack what else would one need? "
1764,Explored this place recently while searching for terrace cafe and i was NOT disappointed at all. Everything on point from food to drinks to service to ambience to music. How can someone be so perfect ? Then i met the owner of the place and came to know they are a team of 4 people and always on floor helping the guests and giving them a word class service. Hats off to the team and more power and love. A must visit cafe in North Delhi. As a customer i look only for good service and they are the best.
1765,"The service was not up to the mark and we felt that the food was not at all nice. I thought that they took time to serve us so it might be nice but the food was not nice. I referred to Zomato for the Restaurant but the rating is not at all current, it should not even be given a single star.I think that you should re check the rating they have achieved and I want Zomato to give them the surprise check."

They gave us a glass of water. First of all, all the glasses were kept open on the counter that too on terrace which was quite unhygienic. The glass of water they gave me had a small spider on it and two to three ants. Disgusting. When I took another glass because I was thirsty, the water tasted so bad it felt it like they have served us direct tap water.A group left and all of their seats which they were occupying got empty.

1773,Went in to this place after hearing alot about it from people who have visited this place so expectations were very high and somehow it managed to meet those expectations that I had. Ambience is very good and its spacious it's not cramped like many cafes in hudson lane. Food was good best was the broccoli soup and very much matching was the mushroom soup. Fantastic taste. Veg pizza was perfectly baked. And ex on the beach hookah was good too. One point where I find them disappointing me and losing marks was their level of service. Despite having very manageable audience we had to suffer bad level of serving from them. Hope they improve on this next time when I visit the place again.

There are two cute truck shaped tables too.With their courteous staff, lip smacking food and good music, Mama's Buoi is undoubtedly at par with my personal favorites (Spezia, Cafeteria and co. and Abongchiiz).We ordered Coffee and toblerone shake, Ozzy jumble, Mama's Sangria , Signature pizza, Wild pizza, Chilli pizza, Indiana sandwich (veg.

Staff was very cooperative and the service was on time as well given the mad rush. I really loved the food, really delicious. Do visit !!"
1777,A cosy place with an amazing terrace at GTB naga.The food was nice and we really liked the mozzarella cheese sticks and the oreo shake .The hookahs were better looking than any other cafe in the vicinity and the flavour was good too. Would have give 5 stars but the only drawback was that i got my table very late.

1783,Very poor management. We called to get a reservation but we were told its first come first serve. On arrival they said all tables were booked. Did not get proper service or even appropriate seating on continuous requests. The hookah is also not great as it required resetting several times. Nothing extraordinary so keep it as your last resort if you are out already.
1784,"After a long time found place that serves good and authentic food. We ordered dimsums, chilly mushrooms, manchow soup, and Punjab e pizza. And all the dishes were commendable. The only drawback is the slow service. We went on Wednesday and it took almost 20-25 min for each dish to come."

Not a very good experience on this part. "

They have two levels of terrace, one of which is a Tiny one led by stairs from the big terrace, somewhat like the arrangement you have at Mia Bella.The interiors give a fancy feel, the service is good but not very fast, the food is decent- nothing stood out though and there's ample parking which is imperative considering the area.What is special about the place is that have live music on some days."

1792,The breakfast brunch was great. We went at 10:45 and everything was still hot and there was plenty of everything. Our server was very friendly and took good care of us. We enjoyed sitting at the pool and enjoying cocktails.
1793,"It can become a hot destination but it aint one yet.Its USP's are a nicely done up terrace and that they serve alcohol (both these things are rare in the already flooded food market of Hudson Lines).It also has hookah, so it has all the masalas to make it a hit.BUT it severely lacks in the quality of food.I went there with my girlfriend to have lunch and ordered Rogan Josh, Double Fried Dal, Steamed Rice, Tandoori Paranthas and Lal Mirch Roti,ALL five of which were hopeless!Truthfully speaking, the quality and taste of food is bad!I wish they could improve DRASTICALLY on the food part and I would be a happy regular customer."
1794,"Found the best place to chill so far. Been there thrice , Be it the ambience , be it the food , be it the service everything went perfect , also has different sheesha's so a add on for sheesha lovers Ahmer Pervaiz Khan, plus it's not that expensive. A must visit place.Keep eating peopleCheers  "
1795,Visited with a couple of friends. It has some good ambience . The food quality was average. Sitting arrangements are greatly organized . But I had some bigger expectations from this place but its a good olace to hang out with your friends. Ambience-4/5Food-3/5Service-3.5/5
1796,A new place in campus..much awaited terrace area with such an amazing ambience ! Good hospitality and nice presentation of dishes.. everything is worth having and delicious ! Go for it 
1797,"I wanted to love this place, SO much but I ended up only liking it. It has beautiful ambience and the rooftop is undoubtedly amazing. I visited thrice, because I wanted to give them a chance again and again. And because they serve Khaleel- which by the way I couldn't even get once. Coming to the food, what I liked: Butter Chicken- it is nice with soft pieces of chicken. Mozerella sticks- YES! Always a yes. What didn't work for me at all was their shakes. They are EXTREMELY sweet. Way way wayyy too sweet. The same being the case with the mocktails- which lack variety. The cheese fries were bland, don't order. Chicken tikka as well as malai tikka are alright.The service is not very...read more"
1798,"A new outlet is added to Hudson lane and one can say a very good one too.It has a very good inner,outer and rooftop seating.‚Ä¢Nachos are all time favourite starters.‚Ä¢Pizza lover yay? a very good pizza with thin crust and all veggies ‚Ä¢Dahi ke kebab- a new fish which is been famous these days at almost every cafe or lounge.‚Ä¢Pita pockets were my favourite.‚Ä¢Mamas Sangri and laughing melon is a must order mocktail there.A good place+yum food+perfect tracks=awesome day."
1799,"Visited the cafe with a couple of friends yesterday including Shikha Gupta, and was might surprised to find a beautifully done up cafe having two levels of sitting indoors as well as a terrace level. The food we ordered was quite nice to eat and very reasonable. Will certainly recommend their Dahi kebabs, Mushroom Galouti and planner quesadilla. Do visit and have a great time just the way we did. "
1800,"A new entry in the cafe lane of Hudson Line, Mama's Buoi has become an amazing buzz with great terrace and cosy interiors.

Tangy and best for non alcoholics.*Corn Salt was a decent starter.*Keema Pav was my favourite. Soft buns and perfectly minced keema.

1801,I visited this place few days back and i loved it‚ù§Ô∏è. This place is a new gem in GTB nagar. Loved the terrace look. The food was also nice. We ordered sandwiches and tiranga chap. That was good in taste. And we ordered sangria as well. No alcohol but amazingly made with juicesüòç recommended üòÅ. And the staff was very generous.

1803,"So i have heard about this place from a friend , being a 4+ rated place my expectations were really high. But the place disappointed me big time.It was 1 in the afternoon when I visited the place but it seemed like as if they were opening it. There was no one show us our seats, no proper staff was there. The staff were discussing the restaurant issues in front of me. Music was too loud for an afternoon and the playlist was really bad.After so many turn off, still I thought i could give a try to food. So when i ask them do they have anything hot to drink like a coffee or tea, i was surprised to know that they don't  have anything hot. So the waiter suggested we can have soup, which we...read more"
1804,"Extremely poor service and the staff members do not seem to know the difference between their dishes and are extremely careless. I ordered honey chilli potato being a vegetarian, but was instead given a dish containing chicken ... I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone .."
1805,"I visited this place few days back with my husband. Good crowd was there. We ¬†loved the terrace and another staircase leading a floor upwards to another little terrace.¬†In the drinks we order ¬†Virgin Mojito, College Mojito. I like the College Mojito most. In starters we order Chicken 65, Chicken Lolypop. both were delicious, we likes it alot. Then we order Fried corn and Wild SIde PIzza. Fried Corn was good but Pizza was not too much tasty.This is good place to visit with friends and food was also very good."
1806,Really liked the food and ambience. Some of the signature dishes were finger licking. Live music on the terrace makes it a perfect setup. Thanks guys A Much needed hangout spot in North Delhi. 
1807,"This place have the best space nd ambience, the food needs to be improved along with the service!Else the place is pretty well made staff is polite"
1808,Finally an amazing terrace in Hudson lane. The ambiance is pretty cool. I personally loved the terrace and another staircase leading a floor upwards to another little terrace. They have indoor sitting on a floor below as well. The music played is really great. The service is good. Staff is courteous. The management is overall good. Their sitting is little uncomfortable to spend more hours. The tables are high in height  and difficult to comfortably eat.  Coming to food - 1. Mozzarella sticks : A must try. Tasted great. The dips were finger licking.  2. Veg momos : Bad . Don't order . 3. Pizza pockets : Average 4. Blueberry shake : Too sweet to have. RECOMMENDED - mozerella...read more
1809,"Ordered keema matter with pao & white sauce pasta.Chicken keema pao was good but in my opinion, it needs to be a bit more spicy.On the other hand white sauce pasta had a bit of sugar in it, so i guess the chef needs to look into this too."
1810,"Well I visited there on a Sufi night .. what an amazing experience was it , that guy made the place more happening.The place is good in all context Ambience is relaxing and refreshingService is good and they know well about what they are giving uFood tastes good specially tondoori mushrooms, signature pizza and magic moments i.e. Mozerella sticks , they were all yummIt was a worthy visit and I would love to visit them again üòä"
1811,The ambience on the rooftop was amazing. In Order to get good seats one needs to book in advance. Nonetheless the Satay Chicken was fantastic and also the Chicken Steak. 
1812,"Located in North Delhi, GTB Nagar, this new place is worth visiting. It's on the third floor and they have a beautiful terrace, as well.My experience here was pretty good.

1813,"Pathetic food... Plz dnt give a visit if you are looking for some good food. Live music & hookah may be the reason to catch your eye, but rest foods and beverages are just awful. I order oreo shake & chilli chicken, it was soo poor that we couldnt even finish it. "
1814,"And a new entrant in the vicinity of hudson lane which is a hub for the college students who loves to come down here in search of good food and this new place called Mama's Buoi which has just made its way in the vicinity is all set to rock. For me , one thing which I have not seen in the cafes here is the terrace but here I think their usp should be terrace which is really big and spacious. And they also have 2 separate private party area on the terrace which can accommodate around 10 - 12 people in one space. The place has very limited number of decor items yet it looks elegant.

1830,"The place looks beautiful. It's big and spacious and rooftop seating (not overstuffed) at a place like this is an enormous advantage. The food was delicious. Upon opening the Mozarella Sticks, it oozed of cheese. The chicken, I felt, was a bit undercooked and not as spicy as the name suggests. "
1831,"The decor and ambience are surely worth appreciating. Good music, amazing terrace setup but the food sucks and the service is terrible!!!!People, you will be dissapointed as hell shedding out so much and getting below average food in return!¬†I guess the owner give about what he is serving his customers and only focused on making the place look good! :/P.S - They don't have a feedback book and don't care if you leave the entire food and leave!I am sure I am never suggesting this place to any of my friends and I am going to punch my friend in his face the next time i see him for suggesting it to me :/I guess he himself hasn't been there, otherwise wouldn't have suggested for sure!!...read more"

1836,"Another entry in Gtb nagar,hudson lane ie Mamas buio so i visited this place. Ambience is not that enthralling or captivating. the place is good for winters only as it has terrace too but then also you cant sit on terrace for long as due to dusty atmosphere. i ordered cheese fries and chocolate shake plus kiwi mint hukkah. guys please do not TRY cheese fries its tasteless. the chocolate shake was bitter rather than sweet.

We also ordered 4 beverages, dirty double, chocolate and mint shake, coffee and Toblerone shake, and innocent lady.  Murg tikka and signature pizza were amazing. And I would also praise them for hukka, it was very smooth and full of flavor. It is very difficult to to bring variations to chocolate shakes as they all should have a different flavor and I think they have achieved that. A special praise for dirty double shake.

In the end i canceled this order and didn't pay for it.

From veg pizza to dal Makhani, from dimsum to mozarella cheese sticks, from fruit punch to blue berry smoothie,  I njoyed every bite of it.Music- From live music to recorded music played there,  was nice to the ears.Staff- hygienic, courteous, helpful and prompt in meeting the requirements of the guest.Fantastic place to visit in Delhi."
1843,"They charge wrong taxes from you in order to make more money. They charged 20%VAT on Milkshakes (non alcoholic if you're wondering) which should have been 12.5%. The funny part is that they weren't even serving alcohol to charge taxes for alcohol. When I confronted them to rectify the mistake, they politely refused to do so. I asked another friend of mine who had been here, and funnily enough, she had pointed them out the same thing, with the same polite result.
