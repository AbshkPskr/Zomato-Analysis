,The Chatter House
0,"It's a beautiful place. I loved the rustic ambience here. They had a foosball table too. The food was good in taste and portion was good too. Service was also fast enough, given that it wasn't much crowded when I went. Since I went here initially in 2020 they had 1+1 on food for Zomato gold members, so it was light on pocket too."
1,"This cafe is located in Nehru place, Epicuria. This place has indoor and outdoor. The outdoor setting is amazing. I tried pizza, it was so tasty and the food presentation was really nice. This place is the best fit for winter evenings. And this is a must-visit place for all pizza lovers."
2,"The outside seating is amazing, especially the ambiance during summer or even winter. It is a bit costly as you can find similar liquor at other places in Epicuria at a lower price during happy hours. But the service is nice. "

20,"Worth the experience , Perfect for a date ."
21,Bijendar is an excellent server!!!
22,"Unfortunately or maybe fortunately, I landed here on a dry day! The place was hence relatively empty, which also gave me a chance to enjoy the food to the fullest. I tried galouti kebab sliders which were really juicy, simple & delicious. I specially loved the old English pub ambience, it was pretty cool. For other details you can head on to my insta page, the flavourful_tales. Here's the link: https://www.instagram.com/invites/contact/?i=1fwli6nd7cqhj&utm_content=8ipz9p7"
23,The food is yum and Ravi is a really good waiter. Really good sevice. A must go with friends. Really love their Dry Day policy.
24,"Visited The Chatter House, Nehru Place for dinner last evening.Our extensive order turned out to be a mix of hits and misses.We ordered three starters, Chicken 65, Fish Fingers, and Onion Rings, all of them turned out to be good. The Chicken 65 came with the heads up from our server that it's going to be spicy, guess what, it wasn't!!We ordered a few milkshakes (no pics) , the good ones were the Banana Cream Pie, and Nutty Oreo, the Peanut Butter was okay, the Strawberry Cheesecake and Cherry Berry Vanilla were way too syrupy, sweet and downright disappointing.In the main course, we ordered four dishes.The pizza was absolutely underwhelming. Definitely not ordering one from Chatter...read more"
25,"It's one of the few places in Delhi which has an outdoor seating, wood/gas fired pizza oven instead of an electric one. The fresh dough, gorgeously seasoned pizza sauce, quality topings and generous amount of cheese, they have the option of healthy pizza also, The best part was the service of the server he took the full care of the table very nicely."
26,The best Place in south Delhi where we go last night good food excellence service every thing was perfect light music nice ambience the best place for hange out
27,"I have been to Chatter House 3-4 times, more out of accompanying some people than my personal choice. I find the food to be just average and the food menu doesn't have much variety. Also one night that me, my husband and another couple were there - the music was so loud that we couldn't make conversation. And no one was dancing. We requested the waiter to reduce the volume but he denied the same. Eventually, we had to change our seat. It was an irritating experience with Chatter House."
28,Superb ambienceNice place visit on a weekend
29,Sameer attended us and he was kind and made sure wehad an amazing experience and the food's just wow..#food #review #ambience #love #relax
30,Used to like this place for cocktails and staff. The new manager is absolutely hopeless. The bartender can't make the same cocktails either. Though the person serving us was polite and took care of things. Never going back again.
31,"The Thai green curry was well tasting but less than minimal Veges served in that, a pint (330 ml) is being served as a ‚Äòmug‚Äô... verbal description and quantity was misleading as the server described as 500 ml... and suggested that a pitcher with 1500 ml could  be ordered, yet a mug of 330 ml (which literally also was a glass of beer) was definitely not done and expected Staff was of below average caliber. Over all a wasted experience!! Won‚Äôt recommend at all."
32,"It's one of the few places in Delhi which has an outdoor wood/gas fired pizza oven instead of an electric one. The fresh dough, gorgeously seasoned pizza sauce, quality toppings and generous amounts of chesse makes their pizzas very special. The base is crunchy like a cracker biscuit and the chesse pulls apart beautifully. They also make a delicious mulled wine, probably the best in Delhi. Pepperoni pizza with mulled wine is a winter staple!"
33,"Not Just the ambience, but the food is really good. Ordered ""The Italian Station and Penne with Vodka"" both were delicious."
34,Loved the taste of food items there in a very classical ambience. Pasta was great and also main course was awesome. Chole in chole bhature should be little more spicy..
35,Loved this place .I tried this delicious Amrood drink ‚ô•Ô∏èThis place has some good taste plus loved the quality.Staff was good.Try this place
36,Amazing place for a evening get together with friends. The ambience here is really good and the staff was courteous. Ordered the mac n shroom pasta and the loaded nachos with a few drinks. The food was outstanding and the quantity was really good.
37,"Quite a nice place with good food, good ambiance, and a good location. I tried pizza and pasta, both were really good. This place also gives you zomato gold offer, so I made good use of it."
38,"We went here for a Christmas Dinner.An absolute pleasure around the backyard seating with a warm dinner served with drinks.We ordered Veg Grilled platter, cocktails with tangy, pineapple like flavors. The staff was very cooperativeHighly recommended.Ambience - 4.5/5Staff - 5/5Food - 4/5"
39,"An absolute amazingg staff, we had our Christmas dinner here. And, the cocktails they served were amazing.The Vegetarian grill platter, is a worth try on. Highly recommended for a good chill out backyard meal vibe."
40,"Went in evening last weekend with my wife. Ambience is good, also huge displays add as it is a sports bar primarily. We ordered half pepperoni and half Margherita pizza as well as Irish cheese cake on staff's recommendation. Staff was curtoeus but the food left a lot to be desired. Both the items were at best a 6/10, not too bad, but not good either. For the top notch price this resturant charges, the food clearly is not that great. Despite zomato gold, we would not like to visit again. Would only recommend if you are a group of friends who want a drink or two while watching a sports game, don't go here for the food."
41,"Pizza - 4/5Dessert - 2/5Ambiance - 3/5Service - 3/5Ordered a veg pizza, it was really good and tasty.Fir desserts ordered Irish coffee cheesecake, it was not up to the mark, it was tasteless.Overall a good experience."
42,"Great ambience, nice place to be. They don't have much offers but they have a huge variety of dishes. Their baked nachos and frappe are amazing must try."

46,"I decided to visit this place with my office colleagues one day . And the experience was quite goodFood : We ordered loaded nachos mixed sauce pasta , pizza , chicken platter and their famous dessert chatter dome . Not really a fan of mixed sauce pasta . The chicken platter was quite good . But the best of all was the chatter dome . It had white chocolate , kiwis oranges , Alphonso cream and brownie all in one . Amazing !!!Ambience : Ambience is quite nice .Service : Found the service a bit slow . Can definitely improve upon that ."
47,Nice food and ambience. The food presentation was also good.. Must visit with your family and friends.
48,"I went for dinner on a Sunday evening. It wasn‚Äôt as crowded as I‚Äôd expected, and we easily got a table. We sat on the first floor of the restaurant (second floor considering Khan market setup). The lighting is quite dim and the seating is spaciously done up. We ordered Hummus with Pita and Penne with Vodka. The pasta was in mix sauce, and we‚Äôd requested the staff to add vegetables. I really enjoyed the pasta-it was creamy and saucy, just how I like it! I didn‚Äôt, however, like the pita. While the hummus was okay, the pita was raw and seemed almost tasteless. For drinks, we had True Spritz. It‚Äôs a sparkling wine and gin based drink, with orange slices and basil leaves. The drink...read more"

52,"Good place to sit and relax with your friends. When I went there, I got a good offer (5 pint of kotsberg). Onions rings were really good. I am not happy with their quantity, quality is undoubtedly good. "
53,"Chatter house is a beautiful restaurant and bar located on the ground level of epicurea, i was looking forward to visiting it since a long time and finally when i did, i was very satisfied. Good cocktail offers were running so we got to try a variety of them.Started with limoncello from their summer fling menu and found it very dilute, sent it back and gotnit corrected. Salty chihuahua was a good try though, not many flavours but distinctly strong. Godfather was usual and strong. They made us try bubblegum shots which are yet to be launched and I really admired this fusion.Tried three kinds of LIIT; classic, electric and coffee.

54,"A fancy place to dine in. They served the best cheesecake i have ever tasted, Irish coffee cheesecake, it melts in your mouthüòç‚ù§Ô∏è. Their pasta was amazing. When compared quantity and price, it seems the items were a bit overpriced but still worth it. You can play at their foosball table until your food arrives. You must give this place a visit."

57,"Nice place to hang out. Hard to get a seat before 8pm due to happy hours. Waiters are super busy and talk amongst themselves more than the customers. I had to stand and wave thrice to get their attention. Ambience would have be very good if the music was kept a notch down. The loudness makes you shout to be heard across the table.Food is tasty. Most of the drinks in the Menu are not available, leaving you with very little choice. Overall a decent place to hang out"
58,Great food!! Must try there amritsari kulcha & cholly..Also there veg platters were amazing!! Thanks team for being cooperative üòá
59,"I had visited chatter house of Khan market and my experience was so so amazing, I loved it to every bit.But at this one I don't know why the staff seemed really disinterested. Though the food was good, but the service was a little disappointed. "
60,Chicken lovers platters is pathetic and way expensive (not worth)Not good üëéüèª
61,"The restaurant has a Classic British Pub theme. The ambience here is definitely splendid. Staff were courteous. I ordered burger and pasta. The mocktails were mouth watering.Overall experience was awesome, worth visiting."
62,The staffs needs to move their asses fast. They are slow with their services. You need to repeatedly call them to take the order and then wait for atleast an hour to get your order served. Though the beer/wine and food might be fine but the slow service will just spoil your mood there.
63,This is my first visit at The chatter house nehru place. Nice ambiance and lovely food. Excellent service. But beer beers are too expensive hare. Overall experience is good will visit again.
64,Okish place music was really loudWe ordered pizza and pasta.The food was good bt service was little slow

Thanks Guys..! You are awesome!"
69,"It was my birthday and i actually sat down and researched so much for a good restaurant and found chatter house to have a really good rating. I absolutely loved the ambience and was expecting the food to be super good.But as we ordered stuff, the milkshakes, kabab platter and thai curry it wasn‚Äôt up to the mark at all. I was really disappointed by the food it had no taste the shakes were too sweet. "

My first time here and the place seemed decent, the food was again good enough-no complaint‚Äôs here.The biggest issue is the staff, which they must do something about to avoid unhappy customers who never come back and in fact spread the same word around.1. To begin with, we really had to struggle with staff attention(inspite there were only few tables occupied, staff was busy chit chatting than leveraging this opportunity to be extra attentive and ensuring happy customers).2.

111,"This place, located in the lower ground floor of Epicuria, has been on my list for a long time. The ambience is kind of vintage but cool. The staff was really helpful. I tried Butter Chicken Spring Rolls, Baked Nachos, Blue Cheese Naan and Herb Marinated Veg Pizza with Coffee Mojito & Matcha Green Tea Tiramisu. Spring Rolls were crisp from outside and filled with chicken and having that with their butter chicken gravy was just amazing. Blue cheese naan came with Dal Makhani shots and I really liked dal makhani more than naan. Veg Pizza was bit disappointing. Coffee Mojito was my favourite drink from their menu. I even ordered that twice for myself. Then came the best part of the meal -...read more"

155,"Chatter House is one of the oldest place at Epicuria and still holds it flag high which is evident by the fact it was fully packed when we walked in for a lunch on a lazy Sunday afternoon.Situated on the lower ground floor of the ever buzzing Epicuria, decor of this place very rustic and upmarket. The huge chandeliers look very impressive and the partitions between the tables gives a good personal space. The outdoor seating is pretty good too but majorly suited to winters."

The food is great in both presentation as well as taste. Also the portion size is pretty decent.The bar has good option and majority of them would be available, not the case where a couple of beer is available from the menu.Overall it is a must visit place and I am sure you would enjoy your visit."
167,The waiter was Very rude and arrogant. Didn‚Äôt not accept Zomato Gold and we had to leave the restaurant. Didn‚Äôt give any help and was fine if the customer leaves.

176,Loved their butter chicken platter! It deserves a 4.5/5. I loved the salad that they served with the platter. The chicken tikkas were fresh and juicy but it was not too spicy so I would give it a 3.5/5. Service is good and staff is friendly and cordial. The bill was around ‚Çπ 2200/-. We were two of us and this is inclusive of drinks and taxes so I guess it‚Äôs fine only! 
177,Went on weekday .. place did not have much people ... So lets talk about drinks and food .. Drinks are good at this place . Food needs a bit improvement .. Rest good ambience and a good place to chill

The place have buy 2 get one offer on almost all the alcoholic drinks and different offer on beers plus they the variety of beer which not easily available at other places. For food we ordered one of their chicken starters (name i have forgotten) but the chicken was succulent and the sauce was delicious. As for the ambience and service that was both good. For cricket lovers they have huge screens for live viewing. Value for money as well. "

182,The AC was not effective at 3 pm! But i had mocktails with my friend. The quantity of them were lacking so i think they need to improve on those standards! The waiters are very cool and cooperative! Love the staff!
183,Went to this place with friends around the weekend and loved the food totally !! But their drinks were the best ! Watermelon Basil Thunder and Kaffir Lime were mind-blowing. Rajma Chawal Aranchini were unique and tasty. Fisherman's boat was the best platter and Cous Cous Salad was well made too. But their desserts we're just amazing... The Chatter Dome and Irish Cream Cheesecake were just so epic !! I just loved the food. You must try this place !
184,Great ambience and very friendly staff especially Bijender. I ordered the Charred Chicken and Chicken Tikka Pizza which was delectable and highly recommended.
185,Most pathetic service - rude waiters & management.Empty restrurent with no air conditioning and flies all around - unhygienic food : still the manager confirms 30Mins waiting despite empty restrurent.Not recommended- waste of money & time spent at this place .Plus they refuse dine out payment üò°
186,"Extremely overrated place. Went here in the early evening for quick pick-me-up LIITs during happy hours. Found them to be extremely diluted with excessive ice, and found it difficult to get the attention of any servers to listen to our concern. Plus, there were very specific conditions on the happy hour drinks which were not informed to us while ordering.Once brought to their concern however, the staff was quick to catch up. The provided us complimentary shots, and a stronger third LIIT, thus proving that they clearly know how to make mean drinks. And seeing how miffed we were with their service and bill discrepencies, the manager was apologetic and provided additional vouchers for our...read more"

189,"The secret of a good restaurant is a little mix of enthusiastic staff, good food and a pleasing ambience and clearly chatter house is one such place. They have special cocktails to beat the heat. I ordered watermelon basil thunder, made with freshly squeezed watermelon and basil making it feel fresh in every sip. In food we ordered:--Rajma chawal arancini:- as fancy as the name suggest, these are balls of mashed kidney beans and rice coated well and served with salsa n mint chutney. No one can go wrong with rajma chawal in any form. Just order this one to experience diversity.-Cous cous and feta cheese salad:- freshly made with selective minutely chopped veggies.

192,"I have been to Chatter House which is located in Khan Market but I didn't like it much. But this newly opened place in Epicurus has become my favourite. I tried so many things & loved every bit of it. Service was good & food was delicious. I ordered Nachos, Veg Platter & Mediterranean Platter. Everything on the plate was delicious. You can avoid Mediterranean Platter but don't miss on nachos to munch on.And ofcourse I couldn't miss on their famous Dal Makhani Shots & Butter Chicken Pizza. It was super delicious!I will highly recommend the Butter Chicken Pizza here. It was yummm.Desserts I couldn't try as I was so full."
193,It is a nice cafe located in the mall. I ordered a vodka based watermelon cocktail and beer. The fries was good in taste. It was served with 2 types of sauce. It was a bit crowdy so the service was a little slow. Overall it was good.

We ordered penne with vodka, pizza, chatter dome for dessert and some drinks. Penne with vodka was amazing and it tasted great. Pizza was cheesy and had generous veggies. Chatter dome was delicious too, it had white chocolate on the outside and brownie and mousse on the inside. Overall I had a great experience and would definitely recommend it. "

If you're looking for a place to chill out with your friends, with some good food and vibes, Chatter House should definitely be amongst your options!I ordered:1. Charred Chicken- I absolutely loved this dish! The chicken was very succulent and very well cooked. It was flavourful enough to be relished till the very last bite!2. Fisherman's Boat- A huge platter with butter garlic prawns, crispy fried calamari rings, river sole fish tikka and beer battered fish orley.

207,The time I spent at The chatter house; I‚Äôll cherish forever in my memory. I don‚Äôt usually choose to dine at supposedly out of my budget places but it was my girls birthday and I was willing to splurge . We thought hard and hard and finally decided to visit chatter house. We had been to the Khan market one and decided to visit the Nehru Place one this time. It‚Äôs so easy to spot and as soon as we entered the 80s American vibes hit us hard! It was like a yankee bar and god I am a sucker for such aesthetic places. It took us a hard long minute to even absorb that it was that beautiful. The menu was vast and we were so confused as to what to order ! The staff was  quick to help and...read more

The gravy/dip with it gave justice to its name.The Cochin bay prawns were soft and tender. they seemed pretty good.It came with an oil and garlic dip which had subtle garlicky taste, which tasted absolutely delicious with the prawns.Next i tried California avacado shrimp tostada which was something new. It had great great flavours and amazing taste too.The thai chicken satay was a disappointment. the chicken was pretty bland and it lacked essential flavours.But the irish coffe...read more"
209,"I'd already been to the Khan Market outlet of Chatter House before, and this outlet is every bit as amazing!We had four dishes- the Cochin Bay Prawns, Butter Chicken Spring Rolls, California Avocado Shrimp Tostadas and the Thai Chicken Satay.The best one out of these was definitely the Butter Chicken Spring Rolls- so crunchy on the outside and filled with the most tender chicken. A butter chicken gravy dip was given on the side, with mint chutney and onions to truly give you the butter chicken experience. This dish gets a 5/5 from me!The Cochin Bay Prawns were so buttery and succulent, and the dip on the side was like a garlicky oil that I couldn't get enough of. Again a stunning...read more"
210,A great place to chill and Usha was our server who was fantastic and on top of everything. We loved the drinks and the service and would highly recommend this place!
211,The outside area is my personal favourite. Had a great time on Halloween with amazing face art. Food and drinks are available at a pretty reasonable price as well. Staff is kind and polite. 
212,Chatterhouse is a great place with a brilliant ambience and awesome music. The staff is courteous and efficient and they have a wide range of dishes to chose from. The signature cocktails and on the house drinks are very unique such as the Delhi mule and beat the heat. The food is very delicious and the quality is great. Chatterhouse is a very classy place and a must visit for everyone.
213,"Great place good food  , it‚Äôs a perfect place for a quick early evening beer and early snacks try to avoid cocktails and go for straight drinks preferably "

The signature cocktails and on the house drinks are very unique such as the Delhi mule and beat the heat. The food is very delicious and the quality is great.

They're so different and refreshing. The starters are amazing especially the butter chicken roll. Chatterhouse is a very classy place and a must visit for everyone.
215,"After a very longg time, I went somewhere with my friend and we chose The Chatter House, we heard alott of good things about it and we were really excited to try this place. The ambience is very classy, kinda vintage and cool. Coming to the food, we triedNutty Chocolate ShakeMango Thick ShakePizzaFruschia Pao BhajiMac and Chesse (highly recommended)Mac and Shrooms (not everyone might like these)The staff and service was really helpful, they were open to feedback with smiles and we loved this about the place :)Overall a nice place, do give it a try. ü•Ç"
216,"Okay then; this is the first time I am writing a review in Zomato as something really extraordinary happened today. I have been a regular visitor of Chatter House since its inception and really like the place. Today we were a group of seven people from my office.Soon after being seated, we made two simple requests. Firstly, to turn down the AC. We were told that it is centrally controlled and they couldn't do anything. Understood and accepted, we did not pursue that.The second request was to turn down the music a bit. It was so loud that we could hardly hear each other. In this case also, we were told that the control is not in their hands. This, unfortunately, is untrue! We could see...read more"
217,The Chatter House is the best place to hangout with friends and we ordered pizza and pav bhaji with beer üç∫ they also have open area it‚Äôs nicely decorated and if am talking about food quality was good service little bit slow it might be happened due to any circumstances overall good experience.
218,Went there for a lunch in the month of April. It had a one plus one scheme. The ambience is good. The food was good too. I would recommend it specially for the one plus one scheme. 
219,"Staff is super friendly and helpful. Food was great. I was not well, the way they handled the situation is great, thanks to the girl ( sorry i forgot the name)."
220,Went in a group of 7. Situated at Nehru place metro station. Staff is courteous. Food is decent. Had ordered a pizza and non veg platter. The best thing about the place is the music played in there and the availability of indoor games like fooseball. The iconic rock/ pop Songs of 1980s- 1990s were being played. We also tried our hand at foosball which gave us the nostalgia feeling of our College days.A recommended place to visit in a group.
221,"I spent a nice evening with my friend here on a weekend. The food was tasty with good portion sizes. With so many places at the Epicuria, this place has its own clientele"
222,"Ordered a pepperoni pizza with some rocket leaves to go with and it tasted really good. The burger wasn't that great though. It patty was a tad overcooked and so, the burger was a little dry. Ordered some white rhino beer with the food. The outside seating was quite nice. "
223,Nice place to hangout...but the prices of the food are really not worth it..#ambience is quite nice #perfect place to go on a date #draught drinks are nice but quantity related to proce not worth it..
224,"Visited on a sunday for lunch with friends, and i really liked the ambience , the overall concept, the uniform of service ppl, and food was good too.We ordered- Guava chaat junior mockatil - it was a great refreshing drink , guava juice with tinge of spice and chilli flavour- cherry berry vanila shake- beautiful looking and decent taste wise- beer- all time fav mac n cheese - v creamy yummy fresh and crispy garlic bread- mezze platter- all liked it- service is decentPricing is according to the ambience and venue! So lil heavy but u would love it .Go for it! "
225,"Chatter house, a nice place to sit , relax and chit chat with your friends .. I went to this place a meeting with client .. thought of ordering some food here .. I have ordered fusica pau bhaji, all green veg pizza with classic cola drink .. food was good but I somehow did not liked the drinks .. over all my experience was good .. "
226,"A good place for a Friday chill out session. The food is really good and the best are their pizzas. You should also try their fish and chips, it's just amazing. The only down side was the air conditioning that wasn't working, though we managed by sitting out in the open and thankfully the weather was on our side üòÉüòÉ. Service tends to be a bit slow so it's recommended that you order fast. It's not just the drinks that would make us come back to this place it's definately the food üëçüëçüëç"
227,"Situated at Lower Ground Floor of Epicuria Mall, Nehru Place, New Delhi, this place has a charm in itself. Their outside sitting is so refreshing, thanks to the sprinkle all around on walls. Snacks and drinks are not out of the world but nice. Overall a good experience"
228,"Good ambiance, courteous staff, service a bit slow but that doesnt matter if you are going with bunch of friends, slightly high priced.Caution: call before you head there as all brands (popular ones) of beer may not be available "
229,"Very Chic! The ambience really sets up the mood. Music and hospitality is at par. Met a friend here for lunch and we were impressed as soon as we entered! We ordered few drinks, a vegetarian pizza and a penne pasta. Both tasted good and drinks too didn't disappoint. However portion size is small as compared to prices for both food and drinks! I guess it's the best place in Nehru Place if you are in mood for some fine dine! "
230,i went with my two other friends on a weekend during afternoon.. the place was quiet.. we ordered falafel and some drinks.. the food was not upto the mark.. the service was also slow plus the ambience is not that great compared to other places on that area.. 
231,Not the best happy hour policy where you have to order 2 of the same drink to get the third of the same kind free. The appetizers both vegetarian and non vegetarian options weren‚Äôt the best but we did enjoy the 4 cheese pizza. The lasagna and shepherds pie had very similar in taste. 
232,"I ordered sangria, virgin colada and Apple & basil cooler. These mocktails were very refreshing and had an amazing taste. I would like to give 10/10 for Virgin Colada. Ambience was really good and price was affordable. Recommended. "
233,"wanted to try a new place where me and my friend could relive old memories and in the process have some good drinks and finger food..Fortunately it was happy hours time and with a mild pricing for liquor we were able to drink our hearts out.The place has a calm and a soothing ambience which is perfect for having conversations.Food: we ordered nachos with cheese,handcut fries and garlic bread...honestly speaking the food was decent but comparatively pricey. Nothing special with the food.The staff was good and helpful.Overall a nice place to visit when you are around nehru place "
234,Amazing staff and ambience .. peaceful .. I loved it .. thanks Though was my first visit to chatter house I can surely refer this to my friends 
235,"This place seems to have it all. A good ambience (mix of outdoors and indoors), good cocktail (my personal favourite - Old Fashioned), good food (my go to food - cheesy nachos with chicken and the chicken steak) and impeccable service staff (special mention - Mr. Anup). This place is perfect for having good conversation as the music is not that loud. Love this place. "
236,"Went to this place just for a quick drink.Tried their Gin Ginnie cocktail & some shot I think it's name was sweet love or something, in which they put home made Kahlua & Bailey's. Amazing I would say the drinks were damn yummy & perfect content of alcohol. Not too strong not to sweet just perfect. I am surely going back to this place & this time for a longer time. I loved the drinks, I loved the service & I am sure they would be serving good food as well. A must go I'll say. Keep the good work team."
237,First in this place..... Poor service.... Staff was rude sometimes.... But drinks was too good... That's why I gave 3 stars to you.. I don't know who make my drink.. I will definitely come here only for that guy who make my drink... I know at the time of work sometimes we loose our patience... But don't behave like an unprofessional person.... 
238,Love the ambience here! One should definitely go for this one if you're planning a date night. Mr. Bijendra definitely made our food experience more delightful. Their menu will definitely leave you spoilt for choices.
239,"A must-visit place when you‚Äôre in for a good time, peaceful ambience and light music. The food is extremely delicious, I recommend trying Grilled Chicken for sure. The cocktails are great too. We were served by Mr. Bijendar who was extremely polite. Overall we had a great time!"
240,"I visit this place quite often and have never been disappointed. The food and the ambience of the place is ideal for a weekend dinner with friends.Special thanks to Ms. Usha, who was a lovely host and made our evening memorable. "
241,"English food, drinks and good music, these define The Chatter House...Big fan of pork cheese rolls... The prices are little high but the quality of food and drinks along with ambience compensates it"
242,"Amazing place, amazing staff!Thanks to #Usha @TheChatterHouse, she was very professional and ensure my guests and I got the required support in the hospitality. Cheers Usha. You rock!Must Try: Classic Sangria"
243,"The ambience is amazing and the food too. I had cheese and bean, dahi ke kebab and rajma ke galouti.Cheese and bean : taste - 3.5/5Rajma ke galouti : taste - 4/5DAHI KE kebab - 5/5 üíØüíØ"
244,"Beer cafe is always my favourite in Nehru PlaceBut this time my friend took me to Chatter HouseAnd I must say the place is have everything what we want - great service, nice wooden  ambiance and amazing food.We ordered peri Peri Chicken and penne with vodka (amazing) with couple of beer I enjoyed each bit of it.Thanks for the welcoming service and specially the friendly manager Will visit this place again"
245,Great service by Usha. The food was also delicious and we were catered in a very good way.Would love to visit again. Thank you so much for the service
246,"Pretty decent place with both indoor and outdoor seating. Music is loud over the weekends so if you are going to chit-chat, not the right place, but for fun it‚Äôs rocking!One of the few places having beer on the tap, had Hoegaarden in Stella glasses, but finally got in its original glass on request.Good starters, we ordered a few of these, fish platter is awesome and so are the chicken dishes...Good place to have nice draught beer and snacks, smiling staff could have made it even better"
247,Good music and cool place to hangout with friends. They have some excellent pizza made in old style ovens.... Also balcony open seating area is where I love to sit.
248,Really bad service. Please get rid of Bijender. The rest of the guys were decent though. Never coming back to this place. At least don't lie to customers. Never coming back here.
249,"Terrible terrible experience. Our visit here was ridiculously bad because of this one steward ‚ÄòBijender‚Äô, that we‚Äôre never visiting this outlet ever again. We wanted to order shots as part of the last happy-hour order, and Bijender didn‚Äôt let us order more than one drink per person citing some ridiculous made-up house rules. Just glad that we left this place right after our first order and went to Social immediately, having a really nice time there."
250,"Chatter House is by far the best place I've been to. The ambience is so pretty, I love the interiors and specially the open area, it's best to dine there in summers.Coming to the service, I'm satisfied with it as they take reasonable time in serving the food.The food department is what's the most important thing, their menu is quite impressive.I loved almost all the dishes that I tried. Below are the dishes that I would recommend: Beetroot and Feta Cheese Kebabs, they were so juicy and cheesy. Crispy tikki served with berry jam is another delicious dish. I'm a crispy chicken fan, so I would definitely recommend the chicken croquettes. Rajma Chawal Arancini is another unique and tasty...read more"

The ratio of acidity and sweetness was on point. So really enjoyed the drinks .For the main course i tried their focaccia pao bhaji on my server anup‚Äôs recommendation.

The food smelled soo good and was tasty too. Good presentation. So yeah guys... I am definitely visiting again üòä
253,"The charter house is so underrated but deserve a lot more credit. Let's commence the review with interiors. So they have both sitting, inside and outside;outside sitting has petite-lush smoking area. Ambience is very soothing. They serves a lot of fusion delicacies on the menu and lavish cocktails.The staff was sooo hospitable and well trained. The chef and the manager were very attentive to our needs and they constantly seeking feedbacks.Will visit again very soon for sure, good luck team :) "
254,"The best bit about Chatter House is it's ambience! The food and drinks are also reasonable. Can be around Rs. 1800 for 2.If you're a music lover, go all in! Great service too!They have outdoor seating also, where you can check out the over for the Pizza.If you're looking for a budget place in Nehru Place, go for The Chatter House."

258,"A place easily trackable after arriving at the nehru place metro station, Chatter Box is one of the must visit places in Delhi. It is a combination of amazing components - good food, modern setting and a tinch of soothing music, what else would one want on a lunch date with friends. Adding to all of this is the welcoming and humble nature of the staff, they had our curious minds filled with knowledge about the food we ordered. Isn't it great?Having so much on the menu,be it food or drinks, one of my personal favorite veg dish was the beet root kebabs. And what was different in it was the dip they served, surprisingly it was jam but it added to the taste of the kebabs. Apart from this...read more"

Along with being delicious, the food here is served in good quantity as well. The food melts in mouth. Perectly made. Cocktails are worth trying. The amount of liquor is just what is needed for a chill hangout with friends.

275,"Visited this place on happy hours in a weekday. They have a limited selection on domestic beers, but had a few off the menu too. So do ask them that. The service was decent. However, when asked about the available food and drink (since the advertised things were not listed on menu), the waiter got a bit patronizing and asked us to 'read' the menu.Other than that, the experience was quite pleasant. The place had a nice outside seating. "
276,"Beautiful place for chilling. Great service, Usha served me and was really polite and helpful. Delicious food, onion rings are my personal favourite. Definitely try their coffee with their house-made sauce. The chocolate goeey cake is soul-soothing. Gulab jamun Cheese cake was on the house and was a treat to the palette."
277,"The Chatter House.A perfect place to take your loved one out on a date and have a chat of your lifetime. A bit calm place with soothing ambience and a very decent English decor. This place will very well remind you of some ancient British times. Located in the lower level of epicuria food court, just opposite of beer cafe and dunkin' Donuts. We went there to have the set lunch menu which consists of soup, appetizers, mains and dessert. But to our surprise, they also served 2+2 on drinks, and we couldn't resist it. We had L.I.I.Ts and Margherita. And with the ambience complimenting the cocktails, we had a gala time. Talking about the food, we had almost everything. We tried two types of...read more"

I picked myself alfresco seating and really like the ambience, However the inside seating was really dark and music needs a change.¬†I could smell the pest control sprayed in the restaurant during lunch hours that's why i picked the outside seating. Ordered for a pizza and Dahi kebab, Pizza was nice and juicy but Dahi kebab was as tiny as¬†a kid hot wheels car :(After lunch and drinks, I felt like having affogato, which was not there on the menu, but thanks to the bartender who prepared it especially for me :)Thanks also to the lady at the front who help me with WiFi and took care of me and my friend :)"
288,"Epicuria, is one of many of my favorite places. Considering the variety of cuisines it caters. Chatter House is one of the amazing restaurants in this nook of town. Starting from good food to the European interiors and ambiance.. it also beguils the soul with any good selection of music."
289,"This haven located under the hustle bustle of Epicuria Mall, Nehru Place is something I was looking forward to visiting, and I wasn't disappointed.We took our seats in their outdoor seating area which was beautifully decorated giving you a perfect blend of openness, yet some privacy from the world outside.We ordered‚Ä¢ Blue Cheese Naan Dal Makhani Shots - the pungent yet delicious flavor of blue cheese was oddly going perfectly well with the creamy texture of the dal makhani; and‚Ä¢ Butter Chicken with Laccha Parantha - The quantity of butter chicken was sufficient for one. So that was a bit of a put off when going with a group. However, the taste wasn't disappointing, however, i...read more"

294,Recently visited this place for the first time. Enjoyed the ambience and the music that was being played there. The staff was also quite hospitable. We only ordered for drinks there wherein we tried their LIIT which was nice and along with their over the counter Gin and some nachos. Overall a nice experience with a view of pre boozing.
295,Nice ambiance......courteous staff.....ordered 2+2 beer using Zomato gold....a veg pizza....some fries.....a white sauce pasta....all was good....served on time....no issues with billing or food or service....surely worth visiting!!!
296,Brilliant place to to spread time with your chatter box amigos! Met a friend over drinks and snacks. Had an amazing time. The gentleman serving us was a little hard of hearing but the service was impeccable. Food was delicious and drinks were up to the mark. Great place to chill!

300,"I had sangria, which was so refreshing that I ordered one more.One margarita which was not quite likeable so asked them to change and they did. The other pizza which they suggested was one with toppings which tasted nice.Also last but not the least, Burger which was dayum! "

302,"We have been to this place for quite some times now. The music makes up keep coming back there. The ambience is also cute and the food is nice. Overall, one of the few good places to hang out with good music. Last time we were served by Sandeep and he was very nice. I am sure I will keep going back there."
303,They serve good pizza and pasta. Nothing unique about the ambience. It is same as a lot of other cafes that have come up in town. One thing that disappointed me was mistake in taking the order and yet they were not apologetic about it. Maybe they should train their staff to be careful while taking orders and not mess up with it. 
304,Good place. Loved the ambiance and the food. Nice place to go with friends. The price is reasonable and the food is delicious. Love the theme of the place.
305,Great food and drinks on the menu. Staff is very much gentle and helping to choose a perfect meal for you. A pretty cool place to hangout with friends. Only downside is the overly expensive menu
306,"Fun & friendly atmosphere.. good selection of cocktails in their menu .. food variety can be updated , but nonetheless good food. Go visit for a fun outing with friends. "

329,"Good ambience in the outside seating area (went for lunch). Service okay. Food was decent but not great. Rajma Goulati is really bad. Dal Makhni was tasty and Tandoori Roti was soft and served hot. Hummus Falafel burger was too bland though. Had no additional mediterranean fillings, sauces or seasoning to make it good. Should probably try to replicate pita pocket fillings in the burger to make it a good dish."
330,"To start with, The Chatter House has the ambience of a pub, with both indoor as well as outdoor seating arrangement. The ambience overall is really good with the pictures on the wall and the slightly dim lighting. They have a Foosball table and a far board which are really nice we enjoyed the Foosball immensely.The drinks: They have a nice array of drinks and apart from the standard drinks such as beer (which is the same everywhere), the cocktails is what need to be mentioned. The one that really caught my.attention and stood out is the Mocha Martini. I have had Espresso Martini elsewhere and this was a good match and the Mocha made is nice and creamy and yet was not overpowering....read more"

340,It is a lovely place situated in Epicurus mall and has lovely food. Ranging from starters to the main course and then the dessert. It was just amazing we had fish n chips and the pasta was also good. I do remember their tastes we also tried the rajma galouti which was very good. The presentation of all the dishes were done marvellously and the service staff were very cordial and warm especiallyRajiv and Sandeep. The ambiance was also cosy and I liked the place a lot.
341,"The worst burger, Horrendous fish and chips and preposterous chicken summarizes my experience at the place . I ordered a cold coffee with Oreo cookies but to my surprise they gave me a plain cold coffee. On complaining abt the same they, the restaurant, added some Oreo cookies not as chunks but minced to an extend that it was powder which by the end was just a paste. Apart part from leaving a huge hole in my pocket the portion of the food delivered was depressing. The only thing good was the attitude of the waiters. "
342,Horrible! Pathetic! Fake reviews. Do not go to this place. Overpriced place with horrendous food. Specifically asked if the fish used is frozen and the server said ‚Äòno‚Äô yet it was frozen. Just overall bad bad food

I sat in the outdoor seating that they have, and that is one hell of a seating. Just Wow.The lighting, the plants, the brick work and the chairs‚Äî everything goes so well together. In a good weather, I would always recommend people to sit outside. It is not truly outdoor or truly indoor, it is somewhere in between ‚Äî but it great. I just had a platter with drinks. The platter was pretty awesome, so no complaints. Great job:). "
359,"This place has some beautiful interiors done with great staff. the servers were much more cooperating and were all there ready to serve their customers. The service was at first not delayed even for a second, but as we reached towards the desserts, the service got poorly delayed maybe because by then, they got packed.For the drinks, I would suggest their strawberry cheese cake shake and indie cola - both were worth ordering specially the shake was hell amazing.For the food, you must order their cheese toastadas which was a mini version of a pizza difference being the base used.Also, you should not miss out on their alfredo penne pasta which was sufficiently creamy.For the main...read more"

362,Amazing experience at the restaurant. Very good service by Bijendra. Thank you for making our visit memorable. We will keep coming back to Chatter House. 
363,"I used to visit this restaurant regularly when they had begun their operations in Nehru Place. It is a good place to be trying to live up to the charm of English pubs. The food quality has however dwindled and so have the portions. We had ordered onion rings, nachos, hot meatballs, and melting cheese burger there. Excessively overpriced compared to quantity and quality was compromised. To be honest I have had better food for this price (not naming the restaurant) and don't think this place is worth my dime anymore."
364,"Very average food and overpriced as per it's quality.We went out for drinks & food last night and left out after starters.Food ordered - Greek salad & Tandoori veg platter.Greek salad - I don't know if chef has any idea how this salad is made.The salad bowl had a bare minimum feta, just one slice each of onion, cucumber,all three color capsicum nd 2 pcs of olive rest was lettuce leave with dressing.Tandoori veg platter - deep fried corn Tikka full of oil ,dahi kebab of soured curd ,veg kebab with loads of spices & reasonable paneer Tikka.Not only food was average,when our server asked how did we find food & we mentioned not so good - he just went back as his job was only abt...read more"

The place has a very upbeat atmosphere, chilled out music and polite staff.We ordered the veg and non veg platters, a pasta, onion rings, burgers and grilled chicken. No complaints at all about the food at all, simply outstanding.I have small complain though, on receiving the bill we discovered we were charged for a few items which we never ordered, amounting to Rs. 1700appox, honestly I'm a little disappointed that the management would make such a maistake. Not sure it was a miatake or intentional?Anyways apart from the billing disaster, we had a great time."
366,Been here twice.  The food is quite average and the music isn‚Äôt very good either.  The food however is priced well and is easy on the pocket.

We ordered butter chicken pizza, cottage cheese main course and chicken tikka.The service was slow maybe cause of weekends.Next time in Epicurua got better places in my wish list to try out. We were with kids so it was kind of management to offer us a better table. Would recommend reservations for weekends."
370,Average food and average cocktails. The decor seems okay but has a pungent smell. Needs a lot of work and the crowd that you find at this place is going to be quiet depressing. 
371,Ambience is nice.. the staff is politeFood is like okayish.. the drinks and cocktails are good ..Good for a casual evening visit with friends

373,The pao baji was typical Mumbai style. I liked even the bun. The green chutney is too hot. The portion size was good enough. The delivery was on time. 
374,"Didn‚Äôt have it as the delivery was an hour late and the food had become cold and hard. Food was dispatched at the time it was meant to arrive, had an alternative dinner/"
375,"Great place. Comfortable seating. Well stocked up bar. The chicken tikka pizza is a must have.Narendra, looking forward to the hand tossed pizza range. Loved it. Thank you for the gesture. "
376,"Went in just to have some cocktails. Ordered a mango margarita, a strawberry margarita and a pana cota.The mango essence felt way overpowered and overshadowed the whole drink. Strawberry was average, nothing special and forgettable.Pana cota was the only saving grace."
377,The place is nice but just found it to be too loud. But I guess that has to do with the fact that it's meant to be this way. The food too is okayish. Not the best but couldn't expect more from a bar cafe. Overall just an average place to be .
378,"This place is amongst the many other in epicuria mall. But it has taste . Will look the same from ambience. But food was tasty. We ordered fish fingers , paneer steak , veg galauti kabab , Alfredo pasta . Everything was good in taste and even there mocktails were amazing. "

Epicuria is a buzzing place as far as food is concerned, its host to numerous restaurants all of them competing for patronage. Chatter house does not have a particular USP and doesn‚Äôt stand out from the crowd for the food or drinks but its still a good option. We had their lunch menu which is for Rs. 399 plus taxes (about Rs. 600) and consists of 4 course meal- soup, starter, main course and dessert.

419,"Went there Friday night and the hostess told me the place is packed and there's a 30-minute waiting. The odd part was that she refused to take our names down on the waiting list even though it was barely 8.40pm. We were told something along the lines of 'all tables are fresh so won't be able to entertain more guests at the moment'. Now, I have been to many restaurants but never heard such an odd excuse. Felt really unwelcome. Don't think I'm coming back."

The meat was spicy, juicy and tangy while potatoes were subtle in taste and the combo is very good.For desert, I had Gulab Jamun Cheesecake, 2 small gulab Jamun hidden in a cheesecake looked pretty good and tasted well too.The service is nice, they servers know what they are bringing to the table and serve you with a smile.

436,Visited this joint in nehru place during the fifa world cup and was disappointed to find out that there were no deals and packages for the world cup screening. I've been to chatter house branch located at Khan Market and I'm really found of that place. This place needs a makeover and they should certainly come up with new innovative ideas since it feels that you're visiting a cafe which is 20 years old.Ordered a nonveg platter and and a veg platter but to my surprise the chicken kababs were not well cooked.Would like to give feedback to the management to come up with better quality of service and make the place more appealing since I felt that I'm visiting a restro bar in 2005.
437,"Ambience is ok, there is bar seating amd there is outdoor seating as well. Starters portions are a bit too small for the price charged. Service could be better."

Food was ok taste wise but service was efficient ."

445,"Recently visited this place, located in the food hub that is the Epicuria mall. We ordered some drinks which were served promptly and were well made. For food I went with charred chicken I believe and the chicken ended up been undercooked as the piece itself was quite thick. When we informed the chef of the same they were happy to oblige and cooked the chicken a little more but it didn‚Äôt help beyond charring the skin even further. Went to have brownie with ice cream for deserts which was good. The overall ambience of the place was quite nice."

456,Nice place to visit. Again a different and good ambience. Different varieties of food and my favorite one is its butter chicken pizza. Do try it guys. 
457,One of the best places to have pizza in south Delhi! Loved the manner in which they prepared the pizza.‚ÄòOutdoor pizza preparation in the masonry oven‚Äô. The vegetarian pizza #recommended and mock sangria üôåCourteous staff! x A place to be visited with close friends/date. Excellent and romantic ambience! In love with this place! 
458,"For our weekday outing the place seemed to be unbelievably occupied. But we were lucky to get the last booth vacant before the waiting began.The place has a rustic look with comfortable seating and dim lighting. I guess the football fever has taken a dig over most of the crowd so the place had put up various flags.Coming on to the most crucial element - the food, we started our dinner with shepherd's pie which is a chef speciality as mentioned in the menu. It is basically a bed of Keema (mutton,I guess) which had a layering of mashed potatoes on the top. Beautifully done dish with amazing taste n served along with garlic bread.The next dish on the cards was cordon blue another chef...read more"
459,"Decent food, good presentation, staff is helpful, great ambience...its a nice place to check out once in a quarter... Not u r regular weekend kind of place"
460,"Had a great weekend night here! The food was good and service prompt. Since there a couple of other great options in Epicuria, had only tried Chatter house once before. But, will probably visit more often now. Also, Zomato gold made it a very reasonable meal overall. :D"
461,"The Chatter House is situated in epicuria food mall. The ambience is very lively and the interiors are stunning. They also have a Foosball table along with wooden decor.We ordered Blue cheese naan with dal makhni shots, they were a innovative idea of serving normal dal nd naan. Naan were tasty and unique while Dal was very flavourful. Italian station pizza was very cheesy and crust was very crunchy nd thin. In drinks we had Indie cola and cherry berry vanilla shake. Both the drinks were cooling and refreshing.Overall it was an amazing experience."
462,"The interior is very subtle and beautiful.  The seating area is very well partitioned. And also very comfortable. The staff was very friendly and sweet. Fast service. The food quality and quantity both were perfect. Their cocktails and mocktails tasted heaven. All in all, it is a perfect outlet. Must try out!"
463,"A place in Epicuria, which itself is a lively, fun and well lit place (can you imagine, it's actually a metro station?)Getting back to the restraunt, it has a great feel of an Irish pub with a Foosball table, wooden decor and funky posters and artifacts! Perfect for the artsy instagrammers!We tried their lime soda which was pretty good. But the food was surely, pretty amazing. We tried their shepherds pie which had well cooked minced lamb covered with a baked mash.But the butter chicken pizza totally stole the game. It was the perfect fusion of tikkas, super great makhani sauce and more than enough cheese on a great thing crust pizza!Recommend to visit! "
464,"This is one of the nice place to hang out and spend time with friends and family. Ambiance is nice and the food is also good. The best part is the cost, it is reasonable. During weekends it becomes difficult to get the reservation.The staff and services are good as well."
465,"The service was fast and the food was good and the place had a decent ambience. They even had a foosball table that we were playing on, irritatingly it was in the middle and there was no place to maneuver, the waiters were interrupting us every few minutes, we had to stop for them to pass. I feel sorry for the couple that had our rears in their face while we were playing üòÇüòÇ"
466,"We walked into The Chatter House close to midnight recently not having known much of the place, and with no preconcieved notions, while looking for a place for a few drinks or snacks that is open beyond 12 a.m. in the city. Though we walked in around the time of the last order for drinks and when the kitchen had been closed, the chefs and bartenders were kind enough to tend to our drinks, and the head Chef there, Chef Bhandari, a very amicable man, offered us a few snacks as well, and topped that unplanned evening with a free slice of delicious chocolate cake for us. Chef bhandari offered us chicken nuggets and fish tikka as snacks along with our drinks, despite the kitchen having been...read more"

We ordered the following and I'll rate them as:Peri Peri Chicken 4/5Butter chicken Pizza 4/5Nutty Oreo Shake 3/5Virgin Mojito 2.5/5Potato wedges 4/5The only problem we faced was the really slow service, it took around 50 min for the pizza and Mojito."
468,"The interior is subtle and yet so beautiful. I really liked their seating area, and also the bar which looked so fantabulous, the staff was friendly, quick service. The food was very tasty. From pizza to pasta to cocktails everything was perfect. Must try out this outlet."

Staff is really spontaneous and humble enough ( special mention of Mr. Sumit for his hospitality services). Don‚Äôt forget to try soft sangria to quench your thirst . "
473,Great place at the Epicuria mallGreat ambience nd food as well Cocktails served were delicious and the food was no less Everything was cooked well and had great taste and flavors in it Personally i liked the pasta most...
474,"it was my second visiti to the chatter house in a single month.I go there mainly because of its great location n nice decor n dimly light with the music that u can connect urself.On both of my visit i have tried pizza and burger.Three cheese pizza is great and i enjoyed it,chef could however put olive or jalapeno to give it a twist.tried moroccan lamb burger..nothing so special about it,u can give a miss.howevery there burger by the name of lucy was good.It got everything that u need in your burger.Go there for great drink selection and good food."
475,"Ordered veg pizza but not liked the taste, burger was also not satisfying. Pasta with white gravy was dry and very hard to eat. Service was also very slow in the end after waiting long for bill clearing we had gone to the counter for billing."
476,"Food - 3.5/5Service - 3.5/5Ambience - 4/5Overall - 3.5/5Went there to chill with friends iver beer and snacks. The place has both alfresco seating and indoor seating, we chose to sit inside with comfortable arrangement of seats. The ambience is decent and the music played was mainly commercial connecting to each individual.Food was decent, although tried limited options but Mezze platter and Nachos were pretty good. The staff was warm and helped with a smile, though it took way too long for them to serve.Overall, a decent place to hangout with friends, not very light on pocket though. "
477,"This is quite a beautiful place with bold interiors and a big bar. Although I didn't go there for their drinks they had a vast drinks menu.I ordered their three cheese pizza which was buttery and loaded with cheese(of course) hazelnut mocha, nutty Oreo shake and a cafe latte they were okiesh for me except the Oreo shake.Liked their service and staff but again it is famous for it's drinks so can't really compare that."
478,Very good 
479,"Good ambience, lived the time. Sumit hosted our orders and made sure our evening goes nothing less than great. Had one plus one before 8 pm and after 10 pm the place gets lightened. "
480,"So went here with my girls, to chill and relax and just have a good time. And chatter house was pretty great! Tried their: Herb Marinated Pizza And Indian main course platterloved both of the dishes and the quantity as well.The only low point were the drinks for me. Almost none of the drinks that we ordered was even around average. So yeah pretty bad. Tried their:Watermelon Mojito - More like Water and Melon. Virgin Sangria - It was average And Chocolate shake - A decent oneOther than this, the food was really great."
481,"Must visiting place at nehru place, new Delhi.When you step in your first leg you feel like you are entering into a royal castle. The staff members were so good.Ambience- 4.5/5Food- 4/5Service- 4/5."
482,"The food was okay. Chicken tikka pizza was good, lamb burger was below average. The ambience and service though was below par. The music was too loud.  We asked them to tone it down slightly but to no avail. Also we requested them to arrange the tables properly but didn‚Äôt find much help. "
483,"The Ambience of this place is nice. I liked the dim atmosphere with some amazing music buzzing in the background. We were certainly disappointed by their seating and slow service. We went here on a Team Lunch. The seating they had was pretty congested and clumsy. To add to our bad experience, their sevice was extremely slow despite the place not being that crowded. Recommended - We ordered a lot of dishes and they all were satisfactory. Two dishes stood out the most and we loved them. They were the Shephard's Pie and Butter Chicken Pizza. These two are definitely recommended. Not Recommended - Rajma Galauti Kebabs. They were totally dry and not good. Also, the Three Cheese Pizza did...read more"
484,"My review is for the Chef at this particular outlet of Chatter House. My friend and I found a slight shortcoming in the pizza during our visit to this place. We had to return the food and to my friends extreme dismay who was already holding a pizza slice about to pop it her mouth, which was smelling so good. We really appreciate the chef's gesture of apologising and offering us a plate of nachos to munch on with our drinks and also a dessert at the end. This shows that you really care about your customers satisfaction as well as reputation. Such gestures make to leave a place with a good aftertaste. Thank you! I will look forward to going back again on my next visit to Delhi."
485,"I love this place. Visited with a few friends of mine and had drink like hell. But most of it all it was a place with an ambience to sit and have a long conversation with your fellas.Food is also really great. So those who love all 3 i.e. their food, drinks and friends, they must head this place.Overall a 4/5 for this place."
486,We had asked before booking a table for 12 people if the place is good for a family gathering and we were assured it was. But the music decibel is not appropriate for humans let alone family. Really disappointed. We had to leAve and go somewhere else. Although the appetizers we were able to eat were good and the pizza stood out. 
487,"We had butter chicken pizza and charrdonney and mushroom fettuccini which were quite good and reasonable in price. I would definitely recommend the pasta. We were served by Sumit, the service was Courteous and quick.Overall it is a good place to have a few drinks and chat."
488,The place has extremely courteous staff and the service is top notch. Loved the club house/english pub ambience. Although there are limited food options on the menu but I suppose that can be over looked by the brilliance of the dishes we did order. The Herb Marinated Vegetarian Flatbread Pizza was an absolute delight and so was the Thai Veg Green Curry. Smack-dabingly delicious. All in all a wonderful lunch experience. 
489,"I have been to The Chatter House few times, which is the reason I went there again, but experience this time wasn‚Äôt great. Food was ok, service was decent but dull, beers weren‚Äôt cold enough. Table was crunchy for 6 people. Giving 3 stars for old sake, but overall it wasn‚Äôt a pleasant experience like before. üëéüèºCould have been way better!!"

498,"There was a Rat in here, not once but twice. It ruined my apetite and when confronted the answer was ‚Äúwhat can we do, they just come over‚Äù. I am sure rats and restaurants don‚Äôt go hand in hand especially when you are paying that kind of money. Someone should inspect their kitchen. "
499,"Great place!! The pollo pesto pasta is amazing! I had sangrias for the night, it was great! Mr.Bijendar was very helpful and gave a great hospitality ü•Ç "
500,Another no-nonsense go-to place to spend time with friends over good drinks and lip smacking food. The burgers are a must try and the classic cocktails do justice to the recipe. The staff's over-all service is pretty good and convenience of the central location (nehru place) adds to the rating. 
501,"Yesterday night we went there around 7 but the place was already packed. I recommend you to reserve the table first and then go so that you don't face the problem which me and my partner had to face. They play good, soothing English songs and the collection is quite vintage. Now the food:We ordered classic Sangria and Galaouti Kebab platter. The sangria was very good. Never enjoyed red wine so much as I did that night. The kebab platter was just okay. It had lachcha Parantha, dal makhni and Galaouti kebabs which melted in mouth. The kebabs were good but the dal could have been more flavoursome. The Parantha was average.Overall it's a very nice place and we enjoyed our time moreso...read more"

505,"A good place serving good food to foodies. To be very honest this place is really a golden deal for food lovers like me. I really enjoyed my day here ,I had Pizza , Mutton and Cheese Cake. The dessert was the best cake I had after a long time in Delhi. This place is good an well equipped with descent decoration items and painting.Overall, I think it's a great casual place where people of all ages can sit and enjoy food."

We ordered the Indian Rajma platter that had Dal makhni and a choice of bread + we ordered Pao bhaji and then on drinks we had Hobgoblin, a beer from London (2+1 free). Every single bite tasted amazing. The Rajma dish was though bit confusing but we loved the complete platter. I would visit them again and again to have a complete taste of their Menu. Highly Recommended place..!!"

Food took ages to come and we were told 30 mins after placing the order that the dish wasn‚Äôt available. We also had an argument about zomato gold. Apparently, well according to our waiter we couldn‚Äôt use 2 gold memberships between 3 people. Zomato needs to be more careful about choosing their gold partners..."
512,"This place has a nice ambience and they play good music. As far as their food is concerned, it's average. The worst part about this place is their service though. I ordered 2 dishes and half an hour later I am told that one of the dishes isn't available. Then I order another dish and takes forever to come. After this they try and compensate for their mistake by offering a complimentary dish. They fail miserably at that too. When the bill comes, instead of giving me a complimentary dish they charge me for dish on which I have used zomato gold. On trying to explain why that dish isn't supposed to be charged for the waiter starts argueing and making its own rules about zomato gold. I...read more"

518,There is nothing wrong with the place but i still couldn't enjoy myself. It just felt that there was something very heavy hanging in the air which will fall down any moment ; i couldn't relax hence i couldn't enjoy. I have been trying to figure out for sometime now but i can't exactly pinpoint. I don't remember what i ordered though its been a little while only. The service was also a little slow. I will not go there ever again.
519,"Ordered butter chicken pizza and pasta. The food was served very quickly and was delectable. They have a plethora of beverage options as well. Our server Bijender was very helpful. Compliments to the chef, Dinesh!"
520,"In the bustling Epicuria, nehru place, this is a great place to go without thinking about much hussle.The place had IPL screening so you can have a cold one while the match is going on.I tried their nachos with salsa, which were tasty and fulfilling. The dahi kebabs were soft, but a little tasteless, the filling was bland and could be better.In drinks we tried spice charmer and Indie cola, both were great. Spice charmer was guava based mocktail and Indie cola was more like masala lemonade with coke.Their Irish coffee was good and refreshing.But one thing i liked which earned them 4 star is their courteous staff. One of the Must visit places in epicuria."
521,The service is pathetically slow and the time we went wasn't even the peak hour. The server just let standing and didn't respond to 50% of the times we called him. Finally moved to another restaurant.
522,Went there to celebrate my son's Birth with my office gang.. spent 12k but what a bad experience it was....The food was cold and tasteless.. on complaining I was told it's crowded so it happens... I was like WHATüñï....I MEAN HOW CAN U SERVE RAW CHICKEN???Your Mezze platter was so Bad... I mean dude ask your chef to visit some decent Arabic place and eat their Hummus....pathetic is the word...And I was told i would be getting a 20% discount.. but as a great favour the manager gave me a 10% telling me that it's just a 1 time thing...Dude it's ok... I don't wanna visit u again anyway.. . Thanks for ruining a special night for me...Highly NOT RECOMMENDEDüôèüôè
523,"Went here for lunch and ordered the Moroccan Lamb Burger and the Shepherd's Pie. The food was delicious and we even got to play a little foosball while we waited for it. Bijender, our server was very hospitable and kudos to chef Binesh for the food. The ambience is dimly lit and reminiscent of a quiet pub. "
524,Super service by Anoop. Dishes appeared magically quick. I had the chicken tikka masala which had a black dal along with tandoori rotis. Extremely delicious.

It's a must visit place to have a good time."
530,"The Chatter House, located in Epicuria Nehru Place, offers a fine dining experience on a budget. Their interior is comfortable and fancy, while they have a cute little outdoor seating choice too! I ordered a bunch of things and found everything so rich in flavours. Their service is wonderful and staff is friendly. "
531,"A beautiful place in Nehru Place that has some really great interiors and an ambience to die for. The sprinklers in the open seating does its job pretty well in summers. The food at this place is really good. We ordered one Nutty Oreo, Mini Naan with Butter Chicken and Dal Makhni shots, Butter Chicken Pizza, it was really good. The Buyer Chicken Pizza and Dal Makhni/Butter Chicken shots were very tasty. The service is very fast plus the management is also very helpful and kind. All in all it was a really great experience. A perfect place for fine dining. "
532,Visited this place with friends on a Friday evening. The place wasn't much crowded despite being a Friday night and got a place to sit outside. The music was old school and perfect for 90's kid. We ordered a pitcher of Hoegaarden beer. In food we got a 10 inch pepperoni pizza and chicken Satay.The pizza was fresh straight out of the oven and oh boy it had some generous amount of cheese! My only small complaint here is that the pepperoni was not generous in amount. The chicken Satay skewers came with rice and grilled vegetables such as zucchini bell peppers and broccoli. It came with a dip and overall it tasted good. Except that again I felt that the quantity was less (only three chicken...read more

Just to confirm, we used phone light and sure it was a hair right in front of us and we were eating it till then.

537,Strange thing was they purposefully charged service charge even after saying no to charge just because we used Zomato Gold code. No done at all!!!! Food was good. Mojito Pitcher tasted weird.
538,"Chatter house has become quite a regular haunt on the weekends for my wife and I, tbh. The food is quite good. They do the western fare with a desi twist deal pretty well. Recommend their chicken stroganoff, butter chicken pizza and toastadas. Go for regular no frills drinks, steer clear of the wines and give the sangria an especially wide berth. Otherwise you're set at chatter house."
539,Chatter house!! The ambience and Playlist makes me feel to travel back in time. The perfect blend of good food and awesome music. Bijendra was a perfect host. Highly recommend Peri Peri Chicken by chef Dinesh! 
540,"Chatter house provides an amazing food experience with an awesome ambience . The decor is a fusion of rustic chic and food is definitely drool worthy !! I started off with salted caramel shake and a veg tandoori platter . The shake was pretty thick , also in literal sense - pretty + thick üòá. I absolutely loved the kebab platter - seekh kebab , paneer tikka , hara kebab and dahi kebab . All these were super soft and flavoursome !! Then for the main course i ordered a pizza and a falafel burger . The pizza was cheesy and crispy as it was super thin crust !! Burger was really heavy and scrumptuous . I ended my meal on a high note with molten chocolate cake . It was really moist and gooey...read more"

542,Good food. Great service by Dinesh. Amazing suggestions by him. 5 stars just for his service. Please convey the positive feedback to him and others.
543,"Ordered after watching review in eat treat. The food was just not good. Ordered charred chicken, fish and chips , Shepard‚Äôs pie and Galouti platter. Galouti not soft and was sour. Fish and chips were bland and soggy and to top it all without the tartare sauce !! Charred chicken was not crispy at all while the chicken was bland from inside neither was it fresh. Dal makhani also had an unpleasant sour taste. Wasted Rs 2200!!"
544,"It is a relaxing place to have peaceful conversations. With english elegant ambience it lives upto its name perfectly - Chatter House coupled with delicious food. The staff is friendly and helpful. We had Dahi ke Kabbab,  Pizza and Dal Makhani with Blue Cheese Naan (this is highly recommended and must try).And to top it all, it has a foosball table which is my personal favourite üòä"
545,"It's hard to pick a place at Epicuria,, but I guess The Chatter House is the best choice available there. Food and service totally corroborates the lavish ambience you'll find here. Drinks were also good. It's hard to find a thing which you'll not like here. Although can't comment on live music as I went there for Sunday brunch."

548,"My favorite place in Epicuria. The Chatter House is adorned with friendly staff members, decent-tasting food,  cozy ambience and a  good playlist. The only concern is the mobile network issue inside the place, though I never really sit inside and choose the outside seating area. Still, something needs to be done about this. Rest, I guess the place is amazing and never fails to give a pleasant experience. Kudos!"

560,The place has a good ambience first of all. Visited this place for lunch and the place had few people there being a weekday but still had to call the staff so many times to take the order which was a bit disappointing but afterwards it was fine. We ordered Rajma galouti platter: It was just fine and not a specail one but the Dal makhani served with it tasted good. Herb marinated pizza: It also was just average. You could go for some other dish if you‚Äôre expecting a lot from your pizza. The great part is that it has a foosball table for having a good time there.
561,"I am in love with this place. tried the Khan market outlet and then this. both of them have met my expectations, actually exceeded my expectations.

Surely a good place to have conversations and also can be visited with family. Staff was extremely helpful and courteous. Food was excellent and drinks were good as well. The thin crust pizza was unexpectedly one of the best we had. Dal makhni shoots and naan along with pineapple was a great combination. Little disappointed with hummus but overall it was a good experience. Surely visiting again. Service and staff- 5Ambience-4 Food-4"

I really love their pizza a lot and North Indian food is must try. Price is also fine as compared to other places. If you want to relax while chatting with friends & having some awesome food then this place rocks !!!"
567,We'd ordered pepperoni pizza and charred chicken which was cooked to perfection. We'd also ordered jagerbomb shots and a glass of fratelli white wine. The food was amazing and the ambience was as usual amazing. Also it's a great place to chill and play foosball. The server's name was Bijender and the hospitality was perfect
568,"A very classy place with great ambiance, pleasing lighting and comfortable seating. There is enough staff for the place and so you would not have to wait and also the staff is also very kind and well aware of the menu which is fairly getting rare nowadays.When it comes to drinks, I like to experiment but I also like chocolate and hence the resulted drinks were utter perfection. The muddy water and the butter finger became my favourite drinks in an instant.

569,"A good place to chill and although the choice of music definitely needs to be changed (it seemed as if the person selecting the music just went through a breakup) but the staff was very courteous and polite.this restaurant being on zomato gold gives 1+1 on food. I ended up ordering Tandoori Non Veg platter ( a chef recommended item on the menu) and Non Veg Mezze platter.the tandoori platter was quite average, the galouti kabab and chicken malai tikka was nice but the fish tikka and chicken tikka were quite below average in tastethe mezze platter was very bad. the hummus was tasteless, the lamb was extremely chewy and chicken was just sad. Don't ever order this. No matter what."
570,"Chatter House Nehru Place is situated inside the Epicuria. The property is extremely excellent with flawless and comfortable insides. They additionally have outside seatings as well.Dahi Ke Kebab, Peri Peri Chicken, Butter chicken mini naan are some of my personal favorites here.Keema Pao & Shepherd pie are also amazing.Desserts are decent too.The place is good to be with your friends or loved ones over good food & drinks."
571,The ambience of the place was quite decent.. Tried a couple of dishes out of which the Risotto was the best.. sundried risotto and chicken which was quite different from the usual and not at all cheesy as it is mostly.. The Fried Platter on the other hand  too deep fried according to my liking.. consisted of following out of Fish Fingers  were okay.. Chicken nuggets ordinary.. Prawns not that great.. Amritsari fish was the best of the lot.. chicken wings had too much of barbeque sauce..The service of the place was quite fast though and liked that the best about it.. fresh lime too was good
572,"I had visited this place for lunch and was really impressed. They have a very nice ambiance and they also have a foose ball table . The staff was nice and humble. Coming to there food, I had odered Peporoni Pizza and Mutton Galouti kebab. The food tasted really nice specially there Galouti Kebab is a must try.They also have a great collection of draught beer.Over all had great experiance and the place is  value for money"

582,"Loved the ambiance at Chatter House, although the loud music at times, doesn't help the ""chatter"". The food is good, but this place is gotta be one of the finest places to get hammered. They have one of the best range of draught beers available.

Thank you for serving best food.. Ishpreet kaur Food blogger Instagram- foodish_sensulist"
584,Food is definitely good but the quality of service can be improved as the staff had a bit of an attitude and would gauge you before you even order. A couple looking out for a good place to chill is not a top priority for them as the staff does not expect them to spend much...so be it. Didn't ordered much :)..Please go for some quality food though and i do hope the service improves.
585,I have been ordering online from Chatter House for quite a while now and I just can‚Äôt have enough of their butter chicken pizza. It is purely amazing. Their standard of professionalism and ensuring that they adhere to the requirements is commendable. I enjoy their mix sauce pasta as well. It‚Äôs a good and refreshing change of taste palate and simply amazing food.
586,"After my bad experience reported earlier, the manager called me back just now and has assured of replacement. I appreciate their positive response."
587,"Food was OK, but the Bhuna Ghost has fully leaked out - so we could only have a ghost of the meat!"

But no- it was the worst soup I have had in my life. I ordered a soup today particularly because I was sick- but what arrived was a watery liquidy mess with some pieces of cream floating around, a sub standard piece of bread with some pesto mess on it. Absolutely disappointed. Maybe the chatter house should stick to serving drinks they buy from outside"
591,I really like this place for its seating style and good taste in music.This is one of the few good places in Delhi NCR for perfect saturday evenings.The staff is courteous and helpful.We ordered Blue cheese Naan which were served with Dal Makhni and Pineapple chatni and tasted okay.Mezze Non Veg platter tasted amazing. Loved this one the most.Galouti Kebab Platter that we ordered was a little disappointing as it tasted mostly bland.

I preferred the outdoor seatings among so much of greenery. The staff is really humble and service is super quick. I tried the nutty Oreo shake and salted caramel shake. Both of them had an eye catchy presentation although the nutty Oreo shake was on the win win side because of the smooth chocolatey flavour and Oreo crunch that are felt in very sip.Tandoori Non veg kebab sizzler contained chicken tikka, chicken seekh, chicken malai tikka and fish tikka.

603,The place is a gem to your eyes with variety of food and cocktails being offered and keeping the authenticity of the cuisines. Mulled wine and berry blast are few of the cocktails worth trying for. Their new winter menu has some amazing sizzlers amongst which Veg and Non veg Kebab sizzlers are worth trying for. Not to forget their choco roll in desserts. The dish is simply die hearting.

I ordered a Tandoori non-veg kebab sizzler which was served on  a hot plate an excellent mixture of flavors and herbs along with a chatter irish coffee an excellent blend of whiskey topped with coffee whipped cream and dark chocolate. Then I order a butter chicken mini naans in which butter chicken and dal makhani was severed in tea cups along with stuffed naans. For desserts we ordered chocolate cigar with brown dust vanilla...read more

616,"So I recently went to this newly outlet in Nehru Place. I have been to the khan market one before and really liked it, so I had high expectations for it. And luckily I wasn‚Äôt disappointed at all. Loved the daal makhni and naan and specially the way food was represented just made my day. Shakes were great too and dessert were my absolute favourite. I highly recommend going to this place for multiple reasons, it‚Äôs ambience it‚Äôs food and it‚Äôs ever so friendly staff. Cheers to this place! Definitely coming back. "
617,"The Chatter House is my all time favourite. I always had a fine experience visiting this place. Be it their ambiance or service or food or drinks every thing here is just perfect. Went there with some friends and tried their Winter menu. I however have some of my favourite from their normal menu and stick to ordering them always. But their special winter menu had some fabulous drinks that can't be ignored also the sizzlers that they have introduced are pretty good too. So we ordered Tandoori Non Veg Kebab Sizzler which had Mutton Seekh, Chicken Tikka, Chicken Malai Tikka and Fish Tikka. Fabulous Platter all the tikkas were made well. Drinks that we ordered were Hot Rum Toddy which had...read more"
618,"Always heard good remarks about this place. Been to the Khan market branch and had a fabulous experience. Planned a family dinner at this place. We tried the new winter menu. It included various new kinds of starters. We ordered veg platter and non veg platter sizzler. It had all types of inclusions such as dahi kebab , paneer tikka , veg seekh , murgh malai tikka , fish tikka etc. Alongside we ordered Oreo shake and  strawberry cheesecake shake. Nextordered Italian pizza. Later we ordered blue cheese naan alongwith dal makhani shots and butter chicken mini naans alongwith the gravy. This place is definitely recommended. Like the last time this experience was also worth the visit."
619,"Food - 4/5Ambience - 4/5Service - 4/5Value for money [Zomato Gold Visit]- 4/5The Chatter House is a huge restaurant/bar with indoor as well as outdoor seating. I would recommend the outdoor seating, which is like a fancy garden. The indoors are somewhat a red-brick vintage-like diner. The food is good. We tried paneer tikka for appetisers. The paneer was soft and tasty, and the onion/capsicum/tomato were well grilled. We had the mixed sauce penne, which  tasted good, but I won't recommend, because I really like the simple rosemary potato wedges more than the complex pasta. Would recommend Chatter House for a weekday dinner if you have zomato gold!"
620,"While coming from main entrance of Epicuria you will see a old European styled clock on wooden made wall. While you enter it you will see a board soccer game on one side along cushion sofas and on other side seating as a restaurant to eat at. A classy restraunt with old European style theme. It's a pub also that serves finger food ,Italian and North indian delicacies alongside a wide range of liquors . It offers live sports screening ,live music,WiFi as well as home delivery.

621,If you are looking for a place which has good ambience and feel this is the place for you. Loved the music which is being played here. It was quite costly though.
622,"Let‚Äôs talk about food first: Blue cheese stuffed mini naans served with pineapple chutney and dal makhani shots were really good. Had sangria, few cocktails and baileys. Drinks were respectable. I feel food was more of its USP.Delicious!! üíïüíï P.S. blue cheese is bit pungent. Not everyone‚Äôs favourite.Ambience: Nice. They don‚Äôt had loud music on. I went during day. It was good because I met a friend after a long time and all we wanted to was chat. Service: Really good. The person serving us was really humble.I had a great time!"
623,"A great place to be at,no matter what the time of the day.Have a been a recipient of their kind service many a times.Its the typical neighbourhood pub/cafe, having more than the usual share of drinks and curated cocktails.Food is quite good too,especially the starters.The foosball table and the dartboard provide an added source of entertainment to the excellent playlist they have."
624,"Food is nice so is the ambience.But a little work is needed in service sector, waiters should be more polite and quick.When i was there i saw a  couple arguing with reception people.That spoils the mood"
625,I had butter chicken spring rolls and mixed sauce penne pasta. I quite enjoyed the food.. and found the dishes flavourful.. I might visit again.. might not.. the food was nice enough

628,"Chatterhouse is a beautiful restaurant in Epicuria, Nehru place. The decor gives a European touch to the vibes with woodwork and diner style seating. My favourite corner of the restaurant is their alfresco. On a winter afternoon I tried their new winter cocktails and enjoyed it. Seekh kebab platter was tasty and each of their kebab was well made. Loved the green chutney as well. Kebabs were served on a sizzler platter and on a wintery day it was a perfect arrangement. Food overall is nice at chatterhouse, and drinks too were made well. In comparison with variety of different classy restaurants in the vicinity, chatterhouse may do well to be more efficient in their customer...read more"
629,Great food. Especially recommend the butter chicken spring rolls. Excellent way of adapting local flavours to international food items. Pretty much everything on the menu is great.Have been served by Chang a few times and his hospitality is amazing. Knows my order by heart now. I tend to come here every week just for the spring rolls.Only one problem here lack of cellular connectivity.This review is posted directly from the place.

Seen mostly Chelsea fans here as I am not a Chelsea fan I used to avoid this place.Today a friend dragged me here and I wasn't disappointed at all.Had a cup of coffee which was exactly like I want my coffee to be and then came heavenly butter chicken spring rolls, simply wow out of the world. Melting in the mouth.I can come here just for the butter chicken spring rolls :).Prateek Kalra Good food amazing UK feel can come here often :)"
631,"I recently visited The Chatter House, Nehru Place to try their new Winter menu, the menu has a number of Sizzlers, Pizzas', Main Course items, desserts and cocktails to choose from. Out of all the dishes tried, my recommended ones are-1. The Italian Station Pizza- 14'' thin crushed pizza base loaded with bacconcini, basil, sundried tomatoes and jalapeno's. A perfect pizza for vegetarians. The best part about the pizza was the quality of cheese used.2. Fig and Blue Cheese surprise- Another vegetarian delicacy, I'm not a big fan of blue cheese because of its pungent smell but tried it here. The chef has made use of blue cheese beautifully and all the figs used are cherry on cake.3....read more"
632,Me and my friend went there for lunch. The ambience and decor was cosy and calm accompanied by music. We ordered panner tikka burger which came with freshly chopped salad and crispy potato wedges. We also ordered blue cheese cottage naan with dal makhani shots. The taste of blue cheese was very unique and authentic which was a best match with creamy dal makhani.  It was a great experience.
633,Nice place with amazing foodService was amazing ....We ordered penne pasta and herb pizza & must say all things were so delicious Prices are also good not that expensive Good one

635,Decent looking place in Epicuria is trying to attract more and more foodies.But forgets to serve them a great food.This is how I would like to introduce The Chatter House to all my #foodlovers.As I went in all the tables were marked as Reserved but sorry to say none of them turned up till 10pm and let me remind you the place is not 24*7 place so you know what I'm trying to imply.Now after asking a waiter to shift me to a sofa table he agreed and was actually a nice person unlike other waiters they have.Food I ordered was not up to the mark.#nachos!When I say nachos will all have that cheesy picture in our mind but here I got Nachos which looked tasty but somehow the cream and...read more
636,"Located in the Epicuria Food Mall, which is located at the Nehru Place Metro Station itself. The ambience is very classy, with both an indoor and outdoor sitting area. There's a dartboard and a foosball table for you to while away your time. The staff is extremely courteous, and me being a Zomato Gold Member, they were extra attentive and polite.Their signature Blue Cheese Naan with Dal Makhni shots didn't go very well with me. I mean, it was great, and blue cheese is definitely an acquired taste... but not one of those things that blow your taste buds.That has to be their goddamn MUSHROOM RISOTTO. Absolute perfection.

Have great decor with extensive beverage lists which adds fun to your dining experience. They had in-house DJ playing nice music and outdoor seating too.¬†Service is attentive, recommend to prebook table to avoid long waiting time."
639,A decent place to hangout to with friends and colleagues. Veg and non veg platter were delicious. Courteous staff and outer seating is nice. Wood oven pizza is worth a try.

641,"Loved the old British pubs setting and ambiance of this place, the food and drinks were good too.  The music could‚Äôve been better but overall a very good experience.  "
642,"I had been wanting to try Chatter House for the longest time! My first experience was great, a special thanks to the Zomato Gold membership. We ordered single platters of veg and non veg, each was more than enough for one person. Their chicken skewers with saffron rice and grilled veggies was good too, a bit more for one person alone.All in all, a good food experience. The setup is a classic English pub/ diner. The service was good too. The staff was polite and very responsive. "
643,I am a food lover there for I will go chatter house again and I love the concept and dacorate the chatter house which is located epicuria mall nehru place.Let talk about food.

646,"Had a horrible experience at The Chatter House. All thanks to the staff and ongoing offers. I had reserved a seat online and they refused to give us the ongoing so called 'offers'. Poor service by staff, orders took ages to arrive and that too wrong ones came up. Rude staff. I would highly recommend people to look for other options nearby. I really wish Zomato had a 0.5 rating option. "
647,"Sat down to celebrate a family occasion. Had cranberry cocktail and chicken croquets, keema pao (zomato gold complimentary) and galouti kebab...The galouti kebab did not live up.. the croquet did! I guess the appetizers here are more interesting than anything else. Will be back to try some more. "
648,An amazing place . It also has a small outdoor sitting . The food was delicious and the place is very beautiful. Also they have the wood fired pizza which are amazing and a must try . Also they have introduced different sizzlers .It is a must visit place.

652,A decent place to hang out. My food had an insect so off course keep your eyes open! Food wasn‚Äôt that great either and most of the items on the menu were unavailable!

654,"Nice interiors. That's about it. Food - small quantities, mediocre taste for which they charge exorbitant prices. Service - Giveb that this is suppose to be a somewhat fancy place, the serves seemed unpolished. Worse still, while ordering from the menu they didn't know what we were talking about. We literally had to hold up the menu card to order for them to see what we wanted. If you work here, I expect you to know the menu by heart or atleast be aware of what we want to order. Now here is the worst part, they interpreted us several times with feedback forms. This was plain absurd. In fact, it seemed like they won't let us leave if we didn't fill out this tedious form.

663,"Absolutely love this place for the:1. HAPPY HOURS till 8p or so means drinks at an unbeatably low price. Folks order bottles in a go. As long as you stick to ordering ALL the drinks in happy hour, clearing the cheque won't be the sobering experience it's wont to be!2. BLUE CHEESE NAAN. At the risk of committing absolute sacrilege, their blue cheese naan was almost as good as Chef Manish Mehrotra's. Love that I'm reminded of Indian Accent at a fraction of the price3.

Ground floor of Epicuria food court and beautifully designed with vintage English pub decor, the place is really charming. Comfortable sofas add to the relaxing mood. I don't drink but a large collection of spirits mentioned in the classy menu seems good for the connoisseurs. We ordered the non veg platter with hummus and pita. It was delicious, the dip was well made. The second dish was Charred Chicken that I thought was not up to the mark. There was nothing different about it.

I expect good places like these to have a down to earth, polite serviceman, but this place‚Äôs Manager is probably the reason I wouldn‚Äôt want to come back. Ever. Just a tip. When the people you‚Äôre serving ask you how much time it would take for you guys to arrange a table, sit your rude ass down and give a fitting reply. "

675,"We went to this place to our friends as the name quite striked  us. To begin with let's start with the ambience: the place had both indoor and outdoor seating and we opted for indoor seating as we went here in the afternoon hours. They have lovely wooden furniture which complements the ambience and they have an open bar counter which really inhances the way the place looks and the time we visited the place the music was also great. The food and the drinks both are really good, well presented, in sufficient qty and the prices are also not that high.It's highly recommended place if you need to hang around and chill out with friends. "
676,"Worst place ever. I ordered for a veg pasta and  instead was served non- veg pasta. No accountability whatsoever. This is the first time I've ever experienced this. Utterly DISSAPOINTED. Mr. Popli, would appreciate if you could intervene. Start taking things seriously and respect sentiments before even getting into this business."

683,"We had amazing time at The Chatter House, as always. One of the main reasons of coming back here is the foosball table. Not forgetting the food, we ordered Balls on Fire ( Minced lamb dumplings ) and virgin mojito for starters. With the aroma and taste of 'khada masalas', the dish was sublime. Something I hadn't tasted before and would sure do in the future. For main course, we ordered Butter Chicken with assorted breads. It was perfect blend of sweet and spice, as one would expect in the butter chicken gravy. The chicken was succulent and a treat to the taste buds.

693,"I had been here in this restaurant as well, as they also have one outlet in Khan Market. They have plenty of beer options in their barrel, you just name it. . .with flash of an eye, its on the table. This house is for beer lovers. They organize live-music during weekends. And the open area on the next door, will push you to have a pint more. I hadnt had enough food here, so wont be able to compliment on meals.Overall, nice place to chill around with friends in weekends"""

702,"FOOD -Herb marinated Vegetarian pizza. Good sauce, crust could be crisper. Generous cheese and fresh toppings. Loved it.Penne with vodka - chef's special pasta. Awesome in taste. creamy tomato-ey sauce with nice flavours. served with two toasted bread.Decent quantity.DRINKS -Classic LIIT - strong and very well made. I'm a fan. Braver and stronger LIIT - tangier than the classic (less sweet). Nice twist to the cocktail.Boston Cream Pie, pretty great vodka based chocolate and cream cocktail. Chocolate and alcohol, basically no scope for a screw up ;)SERVICE -Decent service. Could be better if they're around the corner tabled more often.

Their food also tasty and delicious. And service was quick and prompt. They have very good wood fired thin crust pizza .We had a good time there.....surely will visit there soon...Thanks to chatter house team for making our day special. "
706,"So we went here with a very positive mood.. but all that started washing away soon.. The music was loudest ive heard in any lounge on a friday at 9pm.. Impossible to hear anyone, even yourself.. so we decided to sit outside which was too hot but still atleast we could chat..Shisha was a tragedy.. no more about that..Food was coming very late but tasted fine..And the rating went down when a pizza order took over 45 minutes, and it was still not even in the oven (since we could see the wood fire oven) and when we asked to cancel it, we saw the chef coming quickly and placing it in the oven.. The staff needs to be more updated..If sumthing specific will take this much time, then it...read more"
707,I happened to go there on a night when they had a live performance happening. The music was really good and the ambiance cozy. The staff was extremely friendly and were very prompt with their service. I went with a couple of friends post work and we had a great time listening to music while gorging on the platters they suggested and served us. Their blue cheese naan and gulab jamun cheese cake are exceptional. I'd say if you're in the area definitely give this place a try!
708,Awesome food...great service..hospitality is amazing must visit place...hukka is also a must try............................................  
709,One of really amazing place to chill and enjoi the amazing food in none other then @TheChatterhouse !! The ambience and music was good along with the service and the suggestions given by the waiter to enjoi your perfect meal !! Hope to dine again.
710,"This place is sooo welcoming! I don't know why there was so much positivity here. Ambience is way too good! Beautiful place, soulful food, perfectly loud music so the name justifies itself The ""Chatter"" House. We were entertained by this server whose name I forgot to ask but she was so sweet to us. All of them are very polite and welcoming. Coming to food - tried their Blue Cheese Naan - which was the main reason we went there and Focaccia Pav Bhaji. Firstly, the pav bhaji. It was just amazing! I loved focaccia. So soft and gooey and fresh. Bhaji was very yummy too. And their Dal Makhni Blue Cheese Naan - Naan had little pineapple pieces on them and it was a delight.

711,"Awesome place to sit, work on laptop, WiFi is there staff is really very educated and supporting...  Overall 200 marks in 100 please visit and enjoy the Royal hospitality "
712,"It is the¬†best place to hangout with friends in Nehru Place. The staff is polite and well behaved and believes in fast service. The food here is uuuhhhh-maaziinnngggg..My favorite is Veg platter, Galouti Kebab, and of course Gulab jamun cheesecake..¬†This place is surely value for¬†money..There is nothing that I didn't like about this place."
713,Finally got a chance to visit the multi cuisine restaurant after hearing so much about it.We relished Chicken Stroganoff & Charred Chicken which were just enough for 2 people. The cheerful staff helped us with the menu .Dimly lit cosy place though pretty quiet for a Sunday evening. Would love to go again & try more dishes.üëç
714,"The food is nice, the pricing for the taste is a bit high, but for the ambiance is worth it. The service is ok, overall not a place ill like to go everyday and chill, but maybe on very rare special occasions."
715,"Been to this place couple of times now.Really like their pasta, veg kebab platter. Ambience is nice and servise is really good. Will definitely visit again."
716,THE CHATTER HOUSE üè° place quite interesting and well designed i was there with 4 of my friends overall experience of this place is superb we make sure come back soon thanks for staff and management 
717,"A bit late walkin, but this place turned out to be worthy of all the praises it has been gathering for so much time now. Located on the ground floor of Epicuria, Nehru Place, this place usual calls for some time of waiting as the place is majorly full. Just as you step in, goosebumps start rolling in your stomach by seeing the fooseball table on your left. You're lucky if you get a chance to play there, else just sit down and relax till your meal arrives on your table. Having a huge bar just next to your table makes you crave for more accomplices. The place is nearly done in a rustic look with bricked walls. Dim lighting, vintage look with a tinge of newness makes this place surely...read more"
718,"I always saw this place adjacent to Big Wong, thought would give it a shot this time. I'll start with the staff. Highly courteous, well mannered and polite. This actually added to the overall experience. We tried the roulette table as well, which had an assured gift. Pretty good concept. Food was a bit on the disappointing side. The tandoori chicken platter and buff steak were good, the burnt garlic soup and the burgers were not upto the mark. The home made patty for the burger was fine, but the bun tasted stale and bland. Overall, it was an evening well spent. The food might have disappointed, but the overall experience was decent enough for another visit! ps- they have a foosball...read more"
719,"This place is amazing for party with friends. Staff is supercool and very courteous. Ambience is nice and music is super awesome. Food is nice with good portion and they offered us free shots for delayed service. Keep up the good work, cheers"
720,The place is nice and quiet being a sports bar. It reminds me of How I met your mother üòä. They have well organised platter menu must try veg kebab platter and the dips are also good and tasty. 
721,Was there for quick lunch. Service was good and food was also great. Had only couple of dishes. Focaccia pao bhaji was great it's must try dish in the menu. Drinks were also good (specially mango mistake).
722,Enjoyed the place. Good food and ambience. Wide variety of starters. Friendly staff..... Value for money!!!!!! I would definitely recommend this place
723,Amazing food and drinks as usual ;) Love the ambience!! This is my third visit here and I m yet again in awe of this place.. there's something here that makes u sit here for hours.. may be it's name.  :) 
724,Amazingly perfect. I enjoyed classic Margherita and virgin mojito.  Ambience is good too. Lovely experience . Go there and try it. You'll find it good too. 
725,Was here yesterday with a friend during their happy hours... ordered a  pepperoni pizza (10inch) and fish n chips to go with our beer n cocktails (slim n sexy)... the food was pretty good and d thin crust pizza was amazing. The place has a very good feel and is apt when u want to have a quick meal with conversation. The staff was very courteous and d service was prompt.. definitely recommend a visit!
726,Excellent food and good service. We really enjoyed our dinner and would love to come again. The ambience is nice and cosy. The music is not very loud and we had no trouble in carrying on a conversation. 
727,"The ambience of the place along with the interior d√©cor is truly wonderful , especially at night as it reminds one of life in the mountains.The food here is heavenly! On a recent visit, we had ordered the risotto, pizza and pork ribs - all were deftly executed. The decor emulates a cosy and the music adds to the ambiance. Their desserts deserve a special mention; we had the apple crumble and the chocolate cake - both were divine!"
728,"The ambiance is really good but I did not like the food they served. Went there on an invitation, the drinks were good but the food was not upto the mark."
729,The ambience and location are marvellous. Food tastes great and staff service is top notch. Would definitely try this place again.We ordered butter chicken pizza and chicken tikka platter and both were filling and tasty. 
730,Fantastic place this Victorian themed cafe is giving me major goals. Coming up with the drinks apple cinnamon is something I recommend also their adult shakes are a must try as well.The food well dahi ke kebabs were epic coming up with their signature dish dal makhni shots and blue cheese naan which was soooo good. Their dessert platter was great as well will visit this place again soon
731,Loved the food and the great ambience.. loved the experience and the service . Bijendra was great as our service will visit again. Great stuff 
732,Amazing place. Great music and really good alcohol.. special shout out to bijender for the amazing service. Loved the expression liit. Must go for everyone!
733,The food was really bad. Mimosa was super average again. The service was super slow. DJ was terrible. We had ordered something as basic as Nachos - and these guys royally screwed it up. The salsa served was essentially just chopped tomatoes with lots of ketchup!!! When we asked the chef - he said that's how they serve it. Even the Crispy Veg Platter was fairly average. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone at all. DISAPPOINTING!!!! üëé
734,"We were really, really hungry when we got here and considering the fact that there were so many cafes around this place, we expected a lot when we chose it. The place did not disappoint at all! The flavours in the food were amazing, the staff was extremely courteous and the music is bound to help you relax. "
735,"Wonderful experience with friends and family n office buddies. Great food great ambience. We really liked their service, worth coming to this place."
736,Really good food... variety is good. We liked the ambience and the service was really on time.. We came for our office lunch and recommend this for bigger groups. Gonna love it...
737,"Really good services. Polite staff and excellent Ambience.Loved their pizzas and drinks. Had a lovely time. The music they played was amazing. Would suggest this place to everyone who wants to come and chill with their friends or relatives. Overall, an amazing experience. "
738,"Once upon a time this place used to be GEM hidden in the sea of the near by joints, but of -late their quality and the ambience has gone down.¬†Still this remains our meeting place. ¬†The staff is ever courteous and knowledgeable.My all time favourite remain their non veg platter and the thin crust pizzas."
739,Chat chat chat with friends and sip on your bira all the time. Simply order the chicken tikka pizza to go well with your beers and chats! Enjoy! Or call it a night with the flaming shots!
740,"Never go here. Untrained staff, probably walk bys. No courtesy. No respect for customers time. Run of the mill menu and drinks. Decor is great every where these days so even Chatter House decor has been kept to attract. Other than the decor they have nothing to show case."
741,"Have ordered food so many times from this place. It never happened that the experience for cuisine ordered was bad. Unfortunately this time when I ordered (regular for me - as I have been ordering almost same dish of chicken tikka everyday), chicken was smelly and sour in taste.. not sure what went wrong this time.."
742,"Amid a humongous number of pubs in New Delhi, The Chatter House is one of my favorites. Politeness of the staff, good quality music, an amazing bar, well organized seating arrangement and decent bar snacks are some of the many amazing attributes of this place.Though some of the items on their food menu are finger licking good, there are some that shouldn't be on the menu because of their taste.Items that I found scrumptious are: Balls on fire, keema Pao, onion rings, fish & chips, prawn star Italiano and chocolate mousse. Amritsari fish was not too bad either.Items that need serious improvement are: Potato wedges, jumbo juicy lucy burger and tandoori non-veg platter.Having said...read more"

745,"Decorum is very good. But the music is unnecessarily too loud. You don't go to such bars to dance because they have only dining. People go there to talk and hangout with some background music. So, why so loud music? Couldn't even hear the person seating next to me. So, what else we could do, we just had our drinks and food silently then came out and talk later. Indian bars should know the difference between a pub, bar and a cafe. It's frustrating when you go for some purpose and see theres all different there against the name."
746,"I have been to chatter house a couple of times with my friend. Food is quite good. Ambience as well. Would love to visit again.Drinks are a bit expensive but well for those who likes to spend 500 just for kingfisher pint, its not that bad."
747,"This place makes you feel that you are in London . The ambience 4/5 - comfortable n full of space Food 3/5 - the food was just ok !!! I won't say it was bad but , also not upto the mark . Drinks was one of the best part I would say ... We ordered hookah it was again 3/5 average. But I love the love music ... This time don't have much to say but yes it was nice experience... üòä"

752,"Located in epicuria in Nehru Place, the place has a tranquil aura in their outdoor siting. Ordered crispy fried veg platter and mezze platter first one was palatable and mouth watering.Not a fan of mezze so can't say much about it. All in all good place to visit."
753,"After a wonderful two week trip to UK, I was still craving for some fish and chips and since this place was high on recommendations, we landed here. The ambience is nice, service slow but good and being a Friday, busy! It has a well stocked bar. We ordered Chatter Slammer and some beer and went in straight for the main course. On our table was Fish and Chips, tenderloin burger, skillet steak! The burger and steak was good but the fish chips tasted like some bengali fried fish. I asked for vinegar for the chips however just got a blank look. A dance floor with lots of people letting their hair down, great ambience made the experience enjoyable. "
754,"Nehru Place, South Delhi is the current go to destination for lip smacking food and high on night life for many. ‚ÄúThe Chatter House‚Äù can be added to the list of happening places over there.

755,"Chatter house is nestled away in the wonderful Epicuria. It's just next to the Dunkin Donuts.It's built like a proper English tavern, even though the.menu may confuse you. We actually had a proper dinner there, and these were my top picks:Paneer tikka masala - The main course comes accompanied with Naan's and Dal Makhani which is insane because for 2 people this would suffice by the quantityDahi ke kebab - Came as part of the Kebab platter, these were yummy Nd gooey and crispy at the same time!We also tried the Tostadas which were okay.The other kebabs were Paneer tikka, Seekh Kebab which were the usual.

757,"Been here for lunch 3 days back and enjoyed the food with lovely ambience, friendly and helpful staff. I loved the sausages with three different dips in the appetisers. The other non vegetarian things ordered for lunch was fantastic. Enjoyed the ipl while having lunch. Nice place to hang out with friends. Will be visiting soon. "
758,"Good music and decor. Decent food and drinks! The shepherd's pie is pretty good, and if you order classic margarita, expect a hefty amount of cheese on top :) Not too friendly on the pocket though!"
759,"Another great place to hang out in Epicuria, this place has a great ambience with British pub style look and feel. The food was great we ordered Non Veg and Veg platters to have some variety and I must every single dish in the platter were delicious. The happy hour menu makes this place very reasonable and one can have great time with friends at the chatter house. "

761,The place bears the structure of a typical British Pub. The place is not that expensive and the Happy hour menu have drinks served at a very low price. The food is great too. The shot glasses dal makhni with naan is one of the best options to try. I also tried Pizza which was really cheesy just my type. Good news for ladies that they have a ladies night and they have a special Pink menu for them. A must try guys. Pranav Aggarwal

The interiors are very much like its counterpart in Khan Market - a little dark but very lively. The staff is friendly and courteous and the DJ's beats will transport you to the 80s. The music is fun and enjoyable for everyone. Coming to the food, the taste and presentation was brilliant. There was nothing that disappointed me. Everything was perfectly cooked and served.

767,"I visited the chatter house on a wednesday which is a ladies night. The ambience was great, there was live music till 10 then the dj started playing some classics. The food was good, i tried the lamb sliders and the blue cheese naan. Both of them were equally good. The cocktails were the best part about this place. If you are a wine lover, blushing bride sangria is something you should try. I also recommend the muddy water cocktail which contains vodka, baileys , vanilla icecream and chocolate sauce. "

It's not so ostentatious and has no oomph factor as such. But, the tranquility of this place will make you acclimatise yourself there so easily.The ceilings are adorned with antediluvian kind of chandeliers, dim yellow light but bright enough to have a good view of your food.

Further if you dont know how to make hookah please dont serve it, I have to ask them 3 times to set it right, on fourth time they have the audacity to tellme that they will charge me for the same. More than once they forgot to bring back hookah back to the table and I have to remind them. Ordered onion rings with beer, it seems that they have give pouch of 1 litre oil free with onion rings literally onion rings were soaked in oil.Please be ready one of the worst experience if you are visiting this place."
771,I like chatter house but this place is very gloomy and depressing. The food is good.It is my 5th visit and I love to visit often.I like the blue cheese pizza of chatter house but what I felt they are serving the lesser quantity than the Khan market outlet.However the food is amazing and I love every time I visit there. 
772,"This place has outdoor seating as well as plush indoor seating. If the weather is nice, its better to sit outdoors. They have live music in the evening which adds to the experience.However, the best part about this place is their wood-fired oven pizza. The crust is thin and the toppings are great. Definitely give their pizza a chance and you won't be disappointed. Food served is of top-notch quality.The cocktails menu will bring a smile and they do justice to the drinks. The place is usually crowded and its advisable to make reservations before heading here.It's a great place to relax with friends and unwind, especially after a tiring day."
773,"Great ambience and service!! Totally loved all the dishes that I tried ... penne in vodka was seriously to die for, it had really subtle flavors and really nice creamy consistency. Red velvet cheesecake was pretty dope as well, it was not very sweet and had just the right texture. Apple pie on the rocks tasted heavenly!!!"

776,Horrible experience. Very rude manager.The waitress failed to inform us a piece of information but the manager shouted at us for ordering. Ambience is good. Food is good.
777,Quite a good place to be with good variety of drinks and food. We order tandoori non veg platter which was really goodThe ambiance of the place is also good but they can have some more couches for extra comfort.

There are quirky posters about movies that pull your attention. There is a huge indoor area which has a foosball game you can play along with a comfy seating.We chose to be seated in the outdoor area which was really nice because the inside is kinda dark and here there was ample light.

787,Very nice place to dine in I am here with my friends and we had a great time. They had very good selection of the food and beverage both specially service was outstanding will visit place again for try more stuff.
788,"A good place if you want to enjoy food, drinks and converse. This place is on the calmer side. Inside and outside seating available but the place isn't that spacious.Ambience - 3.5/5Food - 3.5/5Drinks - 4/5Music - 2/5"
789,"Typical resto-pub. Lots of wooden upholstery and a pub type atmosphere. Quite spacious seating spaces. The drinks were decent. Service quick (because we were the only patrons at the time). The Veg Platter had a good variety, well seasoned and quantity was good for 2 people. Good place to hang out."
790,"As the name suggests, the Ambiance is perfect for a Chatter with the Tasty Food they offer...It was a visit with my friends and we enjoyed this outing. Staff is quiet dedicated and the service is commendable. We ordered Keema Pav which was awesome,Spicy Chicken Tikka Pizza which was spicy,crispy & cheesy, Non veg Platter which i loved to the core of my heart, French Fries along with the Drinks.The presentation of the food is quiet attractive and prices are insink with the serving. Do visit this place:-)."
791,"This was my First visit at Chatter House with my friends,Nice Ambience,quality food,super service,loyal staff and Managers,Just you all guys made my day special and unpredictable.."
792,Disappointed with the music in the last two visits.Chatter House is a place known to play quality Classic rock music.But when I requested for it they flatly refused to play it saying they don't play such music which is not true because I have been to Chatter House quite a few times only for the nice Classic Rock hits they played earlier.But nowadays they stopped playing it.Hope they start again.Other than that food and ambience is awesome..
793,"My friend who is regular at this place took me for a quick bite. First we ordered mezze platter and dahi kabab. Both were perfectly cooked. Really liked their Hamas. Since my friend is a chicken lover, the other dish was chicken tikka platter and boy the smell was so awesome, I was regretting being a vegetarian. Anyways, I ordered a roasted almond Salad. It was perfectly made. Dal makhani shots are something@ which should be on everyone's order list. Full marks for presentation. Really liked their service quality. Awesome staff. Special mention for the guy ""Santosh"". Really appreciate his efforts. I will visit again for sure. No wonder why my friend is a regular over here. "
794,The service staff is very rude. The charged us the full price for some drinks when we took them in the happy hour. The manager is highly inept at handling guests. The food is good. The butter chicken pizza and peri peri chicken was nice. Even the nonveg Platter is juicy and succulent.Bad rating only because of the bad service and incorrect bill.
795,"Amazing food and cocktails. Hospitality by the staff is appreciable. On time service. I have tried  most of the dishes, they have kept the taste and quality appropriate, as per the dish. Music and ambience makes the mood refreshed-- Must go place--Cheers"
796,"Yesterday evening been there around 5:30 pm. There was very lill crowd in the restaurant. We plan to sat outside near the oven. Now we place the order of a pizza, creamy pasta and chocolate dessert.Margarita pizza - very thin crush pizza as I was expecting. The fresh Buffalo cheese seems like a moon came out form the clouds. Better then the big chill. Macaroni pasta - the pasta was very delicious and bacon's tiny cubes were made my movement.End the show's stopper the mouth melting chocolate cake finished our visit at the chatter house.Best part chef was moving around the few table for the guest suggestions shows how they are possessive and attention. Service Buddy (pam pam) very...read more"
797,Average experience.. Good vibe n ambience but food ain't worth the price charged.  Pizzas are below average.. Galauti kebab is good.. Potato skins are nice 
798,"Cozy ambiance, dynamic collection of rock music.Great place to hangout with friends specially out door sitting.Food and drinks were fabulous. Must try apple basil cooler refreshing drink. Dahi ke kebab out standing, veg pizza, bhatti ka murg and belly kulcha were very decently prepared.Final words - prices was pocket friendly, if you have a good time spend with durable budget must try this place."
799,Great drinks......bad food.....good ambience. Staff was extremely good which kind of took care of bad food......it needs lot of improvements. 
800,Been here. Loved it. Have made it a mission to visit all the restaurant chains of Chatter House. Keema Pav is my ultimate favourite of chatter house
801,"My love affair with the watermelon martini and Juicy lucy continues. Kickass Menu and that cosy outdoor seating is just lovely. I think i have tried a lot of food here and am yet to be disappointed. Now thats a place where you can just show up and know you will have a great foodie moment ( bacon lovers do try bacon wrapped mac and cheese , OINK OINK )"
802,"Not impressed. Visited the bar late at night and ordered drinks. The place was empty and we sat right opposite the bar. The beverages were poured and kept on the side to be served. Three bartenders were right next to it, but the drinks were still waiting, so were we. We ended up picking them up ourselves. Guys, please focus on service."
803,"Amazing place , great ambience , delicious food . One of my favourite places to go . Their USP is their variety and fusion food from blue cheese naan with dal makhani shots to gulabjamun cheese cake . Must try ."
804,Good food and a great experience! Galiuti kebab is a must. Keema pao please ask for spicy  they make it mild. Great experience with beer! Cheers mate!
805,"Chatter House has unfairly lost its crowd to the loud and crowded neighbours but the place is definitely worth a visit.Food: we ordered the margarita and chicken pizzas and the veg and non veg platters. The margarita pizza was really tasty with the other one giving it close competition. The platters were huge in size and we're tasty.The service was prompt and they were mindful of the situation on the table. They were not very rigid about the timings which is a good thing for owls like us.All in all, this place is worth your time and money."
806,It is a very obvious tactic that this restaurant has with their so called happy price menu on drinks until 8 pm. When I went there around 7:30 pm on friday 03-Feb-17 the server refused most of the drinks from the happy price menu like all the kingfisher draught and pint bucket deals on the pretext that they are out of stock including others drinks like old monk and smirn off as well. It was quite obvious that this happy price menu shown on zomato is just a ploy to get the customers in by showing the deals which are not even actually available. I mean if the restaurant does not want to offer them then why put them in the menu falsely and mislead customers.
807,"Quality deteriorated, not worth going. Veg pizza, risotto all tasteless. Price is too high compared to the taste of the food. It was good in earlier days"
808,This place always leaves us in awe - be it the indoor seating or the outdoor seating amidst the lush greens.We ordered a list of food items which are usual but indeed the taste of all of them was surprisingly spectacular.Spicy Chicken Tikka Pizza had a thin and crusty base loaded with cheese and red chili sauce. The chicken tikka was as perfect as the one taken hot out from the tandoor.¬†¬† Fettuccine Fungi De Bosco - Homemade fettuccine tossed in white wine and lighty creamed mushroom ragout. Mummamiya ! ¬†The chunky mushroom ragout is great on everything from seared fish to pasta.French Fries are french fries but what made this french fries interesting were the 2 dips - sour...read more

810,Visited this place many times..One of my favorite place for food ..I like their ambiance as well. The staff is very friendly and quick. ¬†I like their non veg platter and excellent thin crust pizza.
811,"not that great food . only hyped but .. dint like the staff response after complaining , i hope it improves its quality , they tried from there side , the the food needs to be improved"
812,Chatter House has a rich ambiance and is not very big of a space but it is done up very well. Located on the back side the place has an inner space plus an open space. Coming to food : Herb marinated vegetable pizza: It was a thin crust pizza full of exotic vegetables and was one great pizza. Blue cheese naan: Dal makhani shots with small naam. Overpriced and not at all worth it. Peru Peru chicken: The chicken was awesome and the salad with it was also great. Asparagus and green peas lasagna: The lasagna was worst of the food. The taste was average and the portion size was very less. Take on me: sangaria with white wine. The drink was made to perfection and is a must try here....read more
813,"Went to this place on my birthday..  The ambience is good and so is the variety of menu.. In drinks Ordered Margarita and Apple pie on the rocks..  Have to say the drinks were not up to the mark..  The apple was not caramelized and cinnamon flavor was overpowering everything...  Margarita was also so so.. In food ordered Toastadas and Spinach & Ricotta Canniloni..  Both were good in taste..  Presentation of Canniloni was not that good and looked like some average dish.. However, tasting it made our doubts go away and we enjoyed it"
814,"The Irish cocktails are pretty much the best coffee infused liqueurs that I've ever had.Food was amazing as well, value for money!"
815,Nice interiors and staff was very nice. The prices are bit on high side but food taste good. The seating is comfortable and place is calm with no loud noises. Good place to be in for having chat time with friends and family.
816,"Had a great time. Good ambience and seating, outdoor seating is also available. Great choice of drinks but not with food, very few options for food. Value for money. Good music."
817,I enjoyed the selection of vegetarian entrees they served for the lunch. Although there was a plentiful selection of meat entrees as well. Pleasant and relaxing lunch time break. Will have to try dinner sometime soon.
818,I have been here twice - one time I ordered complete  vegetarian food and other time completely non vegetarian. Beer and shakes don't go well together and both are served here.  I loved oreo chocolate shake and my friend loved the Peanut butter one. We ordered a vegetarian platter as well and it was really good. 
819,"What an admirable milieu of the Chatter House. Shakes and Smoothies are very yummy and delighted, specially the fresh Mixed Fruit Smoothies, Peanut butter and Hazelnut shake and Oreo Caramel shake. What to say about their world class Beers and Ciders 'Murphy's Irish Stout', it's a lighter and sweeter dry stout. Chatter House Shepherd's pie' it's extract lamb ragout topped with mashed potatoes it's amazing.."
820,Went to this place with friends.  Interior is nice &  service was excellent.  We had vegetarian food and found dal makhni the best. Live music made us to spend more time with few extra snacks for munching. 
821,"What makes the restaurant best is the experience they offer. We went to The Chatter house on new years eve without reservation to have a quick snack. Even though the place was fully reserved after 7pm, we were given the seat of our choice at 5.30 and were informed about the it before. Unlike other restaurants where we were thrown out. We ordered spagetti pasta in red sauce, Ratatouille Risotto, Onion rings , Tomato soup and Molten chocolate cake. The food was very tasty and the service was very fast. Molten chocolate cake is freshly baked , recommend to order it little earlier as it takes 20 minutes to come. Menu is comprehensive with wide varieties of common dishes to choose from....read more"
822,Visited this place with my friends.Interior of this place is absolutely amazing and vibrant.We order few drinks and dishes.First of all most amazing thing was Dal makhni shots with blue cheese naan.They were amazing Tostdas were crisp and good to taste.In drinks virgin mojito.Other dishes were not up to the mark.
823,"Have visited multiple times, love the beverages... London charm , food including platers and samplers .... It's a cool place and fun experience"
824,kudoos to the ¬†place¬†excellent food...................................................................................................................................................................credit goes to staff
825,Great place to hangout with family . A place woth a taste that matches to the taste of the general punjabi family . Seems like a home type restraunt . Prices are pretty good but the food is fresh and authentic. A good vibe is there when you go inside .the staff there is pretty good and the manager even suggest you the items according to your budget .
826,"Okay , so after being in my bucket list for quite a long , finally paid a visit to Chatter House in Nehru Place along with my friend for a mid week Wednesday dinner.Situated in Epicuria Mall , which is just below the metro station.We had a very warm welcome once we were at the reception of the Chatter House.Being a cold winter night with some light music on , we chose their outdoor sitting.Starting off with the drinks , we ordered The Black Widow (Rs325) which was basically a cocktail of rum , lime juice and soda.We also ordered Boston Cream Pie(Rs210) which was an amalgamation of Chocolate Liquor ,Irish Cream and Vanila infused Vodka.My take would be the Black Widow.Coming to...read more"
827,We went to this place around mid November and ordered some steak and blue cheese naan with dual makhani shots. It was brilliantly made their mashed potatoes lacked seasoning; their blue cheese naan wasn't that good. I didn't even get the blue cheese flavor in it except for a few bites but the overall experience was quite good. Their service was quite amazing though. Food- 4Service- 5Ambience- 3.5Delivery- N. A. Value For Money- 3.5
828,Chilled atmosphere .... In starter veg dahi kabab and paneer tikka were really tasty...very nice service and everyone must try the cola cooler mocktail ..
829,Just a flying visit in this place. I'm Irish and I did enjoy the chatter house. Call it old world charm or whatever. Just a nice feel to it. Good selection of beers very friendly staff. Didn't try the food but menu looked good. Will def try next timeBTW great fooseball table which is mega fun. Really good USP and something I would love to see more of. Was lucky to play a few of the staff. Seriously good fun.A few beers a few nibbles and a good game. Yeah my kind of place.
830,"Looking for some old world charm kinda place - head straight to chatter house :) Excellent service, scrumptious food, lovely music - what else you can ask for..Recommendation - lover of salad or not, giving garden bowl salad a try is a must. Thanks me later! "
831,"I give 5 ratings to very few , and em not professional blogger just to give exact info about restaurants is what my believe is.¬†I visited The Chatter house around 3 times in last 4 months Nehru Place only.¬†On first sight I Liked their English Culture ambiance which is very much soothing.¬†English tracks on the juke.¬†Staff behavior is very much polite and their food and drinks recommendation according to guest needs is superb. I tried many things like Keema Pao, Blue Cheese Naan, Chicken peri peri, Baked ANchos, Pizza's and etc,etc. Every time whenever I visit i order different dish which I hadn't it before.

832,Have been here multiple times and have to say that evrytime ive been here the experience with their food and service has always been awesome! The quality of food is just great and oh so value for money. I have tried their crispy non veg platter and highly recommend for anyone looking for a snack option to go with their drinks ;). Not a fan of their milshakes though but all their platters on the menu are worth a try. Really impressed with their overall food menu and definitely coming bak to try out more options...cheers !
833,A good place for a night out somewhat little formally placed with English music Choices of food and liquor is good though they had no drought beer during my visit Service is fast with a smile... Food quality is god but taste overall is average if u like spicy food .. Choices of spicy food is very very limited ..They have a smoking zone too but somewhat placed badly with no music and ambience not worth speaking off Overall a good place for a outing ..
834,"Went there with my friends- Ambience and music is a big plus. Had nachos, chicken Perry Perry and Dahi kabab. Snacks tasted good. Thumbs up for the amazing ambience."
835,Very nice ambience...we sat outside and it was fun..food was good...nice place to sit with friends and have beer..the service was good...impressive place
836,"Visited this place in Epicuria when the olympics were going on and they had some good drinks + food deals going .This place is a bit dark which makes it good for a nice evening of chit chat with your close ones.Food here was tasty, just that phone signals drop inside this place for some reason."
837,A good looking place to sit and sip while chatting with freinds or partner. Easy to reach and locate. Pretty ambience. Preparation of food is catchy and choices of alcohols is also nice. All n all lovely place to have a or couple of drinks. 
838,"While I had a good experience at Chatter House Khan Market, the Nehru Place outlet has always been a bit dodgy. The latest and rather horrible experience was when we went there with coupons for free beer (which we received as part of a promotion the outlet is running). The manager Mr Sandeep refused to allow us to use more than one coupon on one table at the first instance; when I asked to see the terms, he relented and sent us three beers. When we gave one more set of coupons, he sent his regrets without having the decency to come and speak to us. He generated the invoice without factoring in the promised discount, and when we pointed that out, immediately sent the actual invoice which...read more"
839,Went to this place for team lunch after a tiring meeting. We were damn hungry and were initially shocked when we looked at the size of the vessels and though it wont be enough. But I cannot explain how wrong we were. We ordered Chef's special Chicken Handi and Paneer tikka masala from the main course. Each of them came with a bowl of Dal Makhni. The food was well prepared and was very tasty! It took quite some eating to finish the entire thing. Good value for money! Do try this place out. 
840,"As the saying goes, one can't think well, if one has not dined well.. The food here was really good and worth it.. The toastadas in their menu was a stealer .jjs amazing it was.. Onion rings and fettucini in red wine was good too.. Liit for the drinks kept our good spirits high üòâ all in all we liked the place Nitasha Tuli "
841,"Between all the fast-food joints located at Epicuria, Nehru Place, there is a less distressed cafe named Chatter House. It has warm woody interesting interiors to hunker down for food and drinks. Lightning is dim to give The menu here is ... > Dal Makhani Shots with Blue Cheese Naan : Deadly Combination and to my utter surprise it was delicious.> Ghost Biryani : Quite Authentic, this was succulent typical Hyderabadi Biryani.> Tostdas : Crunchy & Cheesy at the same time & perfect accompaniment with drinks.> Galauti Kebab : The famous Lucknowi Kebab.

842,"Please don't go by the high ratings! Are these purchased ones or what!?When we went to chatter house, our disappointment had no heights.It was high noon. We entered and were made comfortable in the indoor AC area, as depicted in the picture. We asked for a sheesha first.We were then asked to sit in their outdoor sitting. But wait, the reason was that they didn't want smoke to fill inside. However, there was just one more occupied table which was almost at the opposite corner of where we were sitting. And the place was huge enough to evaporate the effect of the sheesha.We shifted outside and losing our hopes. For beverage, I ordered a Black Widow which was supposedly a dark rum drink...read more"

Service was above average. Do try Dahi kebab ¬†they were delicious. Hookah was also nice. Overall a nice place to visit :)"
846,"Guys, thanks for having me there, surely everything was perfect and hopefully your DJ Prashant will play a special song for me when I will surely visit your place agian specially on Friday night. Thanks you once again."
847,"I have spent many a afternoon sitting in the outside dining area sipping mojitos while working on my computer. Good pizzas. When i have meetings with people from okhla, jasola etc I usually request them to meet me here. Have attended a few parties here as well. Good atmosphere."
848,Tried jumbo juicy Lucy burger well i fell in love only after reading this name on the menu card also ordered ice tea not good at all so not so impress wid it but burger was ok
849,"Ordered the iced cappuccino, which is just okayish. Didn't like the blend maybe. Too much ice maybe. Or something wasn't right to begin with. For food, we ordered a grilled chicken breast and a jumbo juicy lucy burger; both of which were mind blowing! The grilled chicken breast along with that succulent sauce and mushrooms was just amazing! And the burger with all that cheese and chicken did make up for any cravings I've had due to festivities (And staying away from chicken for more than a week!). A good place. Good service, nice music. A fun place to be at. This is the second time I've been here. And the experience is great, as always. "
850,"Great music. Nice grub. Keema pao was just right.  Went on a slow evening,  the staff took some time to pick up the service.   Good for a nice and quiet  environment evening. "
851,Chatter house is a nice dim place in nehru place. They have a good variety of cocktails.Food was very average. Spice charmer(mocktail) n gaulati kababs were disappointing.The place is good though.
852,Good bar.....equally good collection and efficient service. I hope the food was better....it surely needs to be improved. Good place to hang out. Warm n cozy ambience added to the rustic charm. 
853,"The Chatter House, though away from the lime light of the glittering places that become the face of epicuria, shines apart !!!!Separate sitting areas for smokers, good music(live and recorded) and lipsmacking food make it a preferred choice... Have been der a couple of times now and food and music have never disappointed me.. believe me..when i say never..i mean it.!  Only rare issue is the space constraint which usually surfaces only on weekends. Ambience isnt the attraction of the house.. but yeah neither does it distract. !

854,"Not that good place , I guess the place has lost its charm cos of flying saucer and Lord of the drink are nearby . The crowd was also OK guests were allowed entry in shorts n slippers that too on Saturday night which is big no for Saturday night feel ."
855,"This place has a great American pub feel to it . It's spacious and has an outdoor seating as well . I went to the chatter house with high hopes . The first thing I saw was that they have ciders . Also they have a wide variety of cocktails . I ordered one of the house special cocktails that is The York Mint Hurricane . It had green tea ,mint leaves , fresh lime juice combined with Jim beam , just what I needed to beat the heat . I was a little disappoint with the food . I order the much recommended dahi ke kebabs . They were crisp but a little on the sweeter side . Next up was the peri peri chicken . The chicken was hard however tasted good. "
856,"The ambience takes you to colonial cottages of Shimla and Mussoorie. Although they have amazing food, the mocktail section needs an upgrade. The staff is courteous and the recommendation by our server was bang on. "
857,I went for dinner at this place and ordered caesar salad and pasta. Pasta was good in taste but caesar salad was dissapointing.It was only fill with with lot of cheese on lettuces that tastes creamy in my mouth too.
858,This is really a nice place and also provides outdoor seating.. They serves italian and north indian food.. The food was totally yummy and awesome.. Dim light ambience adds to its beauty and i just loved it.. The service was amazing and good.. Its a nice place to hangout with family and friends.!!! 
859,"We friends thought of meeting on a wednesday night, thinking that it would be less crowded, and we can have some good gala time. I remembered the first time, about 2 years ago when I had come to this place. I suggested the name, and the plan was confirmed. We ordered the usual LIIT and the size of the drink was equivalent to a small orange juice mug. Atleast I am not used to Long Islant Ice Tea being so puny. Nonetheless, we ordered the Veg platter. Except for the dahi kebab in it, rest was pretty much below average.One of us searched through their even smaller menu and decided to stick with a diet coke. We then ordered chicken penne pasta in mixed sauce which my friends confirmed to...read more"
860,Nice and cozy interior followed by variety of choices from the food menu. Was not there for long but whatever i had was good enough to give this rating. Definitely will be visiting the place again. They sure have some exotic menu which one can try with own preference. I had piggy & ginnie and it was beautifully presented with some great taste.
861,"Haven't written a review till date but this restaurant made me an offer I couldn't resist.Was in NP for laptop repair , saw a mall sort of a place at metro station. Was looking for a cup coffee but all the cafes were occupied. Then I saw this place near dunkin donut at the basement.Ambiance was amazing nice plush seats with booth concept. Ordered coffee and few other snacks all tasted really good.Staff was very courteous and we learnt how to dance a little (there was an even going on) over all had a fun evening.Much recommended."

863,"I must say that they have exceptionally good cooks. I go here with my girlfriend whenever we are free. The Kerala style chilli beef toasties is the best I have ever had in Delhi. It seems better, and perhaps more authentic than the beef in any of the Kerala restaurants in the city. I love the ginger mint iced tea and sangrias too."
864,This place has been my go to place mostly if I want to go to Nehru place. I have always preferred going to The Chatter House because it is affordable and the ambience is amazing. Food there is delicious. You can experiment with food and trust me you won't be disappointed. I've had a variety of cuisines there and I've never been disappointed. A must visit for all those looking for good food at normal prices.
865,This was our first visit to this place and the food was amazing. So was the ambience.The staff was really nice and the service is very quick.Do try their Blue cheese naan served with Dal makhni shots and Oreo Caramel shake.
866,Come here for amazing pastas! It has an ideal ambience for a Saturday night or a Sunday brunch. The blue cheese naan with dal makhani shots are an experience worth trying! 
867,"Really liked the red sauce spaghetti! Nice ambience as well! The only thing that needs improvement is promptness to customers' orders, pls don't keep them waiting :)"
868,"Quite a fun place to hang out with good food and drink. I was mighty impressed with the dahi kebab and a cocktail called the mango mistake my friend ordered. The rest of the veg tandoori platter was good but nothing extraordinary. The blue cheese naan with dal makhni shots is incredibly good! One of the finest snacks I've munched on. While the dal makhni was just okay, the blue cheese naan was stupendously awesome, the sharp flavour from the blue cheese beautifully balanced with perfectly done mini naan. It is a must try.  I can't remember the other signature cocktail that was ordered, it was packed with ice, chocolate etc and wasn't exactly a great drink. it's easily Avoidable. We...read more"

870,Gr8 ambience. Nice presentation  and good taste of food served. Friendly staff. Good place to hang out with friends and family. Overall value for money
871,This was our first visit to the place and found it to be good.Ambiance - GoodCourtesy - Very goodNeatness - GoodPromptness - GoodFood - We had the barbeque chicken which real amazing with the mix of right sauces and flavor. It was different but lovable and the quantity was also good.The tikka chicken quantity was very less viz a viz the price and for a healthy eater one bowl may be enough only for one. One very good aspect is that most of the items come with a complimentary item like we got a bowl of dal. The drinks were up to the standard in formation and presentation. Overall a nice experience.
872,"Have you been to Chatter house yet? Because this place serves delectable North Indian. I visited this place twice and tried northindian combos with beer.The veg combo had Dal Makhani and Kadhai Paneer with option from Indian breads.Dal Makhani was made to perfection. The rich flavour made it my favourite. Kadhai paneer with aromatic gravy , secret spices ,chunks of cottage cheese , onion and capsicum.  Another combo we tried was - chicken Chettinad with indian breads or Rice. It was the best chicken gravy dish I ever had. The rich tomato gravy with oodles of butter was a great option. So whenever in chatter house , do try their North Indian combos for the best experience....read more"
873,"The ambience is nice , the staff was a bit lost , we got our starter with our main course , the beverages are good ..food was good and they have a good spread of starters ..overall I may visit again .."
874,"Nice ambiance and great food. Tried the veg and non veg platters and they were really nice.. The chef was nice enough to make us a aglio olio pasta on special request and it was awesome. The service was nice but the overall time it took for the pizza was a turn off. Though the pizza was nice, the wait time wasn't worth it. They need to improve here for sure. It's a little over priced as compared to other competitors plus the taxes and service charges made it worse. Having said that, loved the music and food and we sure had a great time so I guess I would return. "

878,"Went for a few drinks with a friend in the evening. It's a beautiful place, very british i felt. Loved the ambiance. One of the best places to sit with a few friends, with a shangri la and some nachos. Had a great time there. We went around 7-7:30, so the place wasn't even crowded then. It's usually very crowded after 8:30-9, so if you decide to go in the late evening, better book a table for yourself. *Thumbs Up for The Chatter House."
879,Been there on a Wednesday night.. So thankfully there was less crowd and we loved the ambience with live music. Prices are on the higher side and menu was limited. They weren't even serving pizza the day we went so we were left with less choices but portions were good. Wish they expanded their menu Coz you surely wouldn't like to eat regular Indian food at a Cafe! Overall liked the place but nothing amazing to talk about it! 
880,"So thanks to the ongoing Dine Fest, I got a chance to try some of the finest dishes of their menu, at a fraction of prices. Chatter house is one the many participants of this amazing festival.I absolutely loved the delicious lamb meat balls tossed in tangy sauces, called Balls on Fire, the funny sounding dish was actually a stunner with juicy succulent meat balls in a yummy spicy tangy concoction.Chatter House has an amazing diversity in its menu.Then it was time for the awesome fusion dish called the Blue Cheese Naan with Dal Makhani Shots. Very different and the strong blue cheese flavor makes it a unique culinary experience.The best dish after the Balls on Fire was hands down...read more"

The pizza was also good they serve really nice thin crust pizza. The chef out here was really a nice person to talk and made changes as per our requirement. Really friendly staff and really good food.
946,Just perfect for any cuisine...nice ambience...With lovely music...A good sneak out place on for an awesome afternoon lunch on a lean day at work...!!!
947,"Food is good, but the poor rating is due to bad staffing and pathetic experience. We went in for a dinner here and came out even before starters finished. Their fries are good though. Also, don't go to this place on a karaoke night, trust me they have a bad choice. "
948,The best place to spend a cozy romantic affair with a fantabulous music and yummiest food taste yum. The best thing about the house is you can get ample time to chat over food. Thats what Chatter House is all about. Quick Services with decent staffs.
949,"Early entry on a Saturday evening. Epicurea is a great place for food choice under Nehru Place Metro Stn. This is located within. Nice ambience, has a Geoffreys kinda look to it, attentive staff, quick service. White wine sangrias, fresh lime soda, coke n draught beers ordered. Onion rings as starters was crispy, dip nice. Add Sriracha for some spice!  Checked the menu, varied cuisine n good choice. Ordered a shepherd's pie, mac n cheese with bacon bits n my favorite, a lamb burger. Food is served on a wooden palette, dishes hot n tasty. Pie has great mince, bacon over macaroni was great n the juicy mighty lamb patty... yum! The DJ gave way to live music which was nice n pleasant....read more"
950,"This is one place you go for music and not the beer! The best rock music so far even if you are not drunk ! Having said that it also has by far the best pork ribs I have tasted and roasted veggies (I hate them). Huge beer mugs, good service etc etc, in a nut shell, it's a must go for all of you office goers looking for a easy Friday evening with friends/colleagues, chill out, enjoy the music and get high ! "
951,"Huge place at epicuria, nehru place for drink lovers. We got happy hours by reaching before 7. Buy 2 get one on imported n but 2 get 2 on domestic beer. They offered limited options in domestic. In food, we tried a fish starter named do aabe di tali machhi n that was nice. Cafe is expensive. Service was ok. We wanted to give 4.5 but can't for few hiccups. "
952,"Fantastic food, good drinks and personable staff. Only complaint is the blue cheese was not evenly distributed on my three cheese pizza. One side of the pizza had all the blue cheese. I love blue cheese so no problem but it shows a lack of attention to detail."
953,"Before going to my story I will just write the positives about his place:* Great decor/interiors and outdoor seating area. A real cozy place.* Great staff. And their manager Padam is always smiling, obliging.* Live matches streaming, foosball table.* Good food.* Not so loud music!. Yes the place's name is Chatter House! Its not a place for blazing edm but for having those chits and chatters, a place where you can hangout and talk with friends. Even a good place for that date!I have my office at Nehru Place and so this place is regular for me. Me and my friends usually come here after work hours to enjoy couple of drinks and play Foosball.This place has the best staff I have seen...read more"
954,"The ambience is good and pretty good for hangouts and drinks. A classic starter you can choose kabab platter to go with, its great in taste. Particularly about this i would embrace the location its perfect for the people living far away to meet at the station and have fun! üëç "
955,"Ever experienced how wonderful it feels when you suddenly encounter something that is completely amazing and something you haven‚Äôt felt like before. Well, a nice decor and ambience of a place can certainly aid in doing that and since restaurants these days are known for their remarkable interiors, they can also help you experience a similar feel. The Chatterhouse can surely be described as one such place as the ambience of the place is very lively and happening. You can see the youngsters playing pool, ladies enjoying their drinks and guys having a chat which is all very pleasing to see.Apart from the memorable aura of the place, it also houses some delectable dishes out which I...read more"
956,"We all like to go to a restaurant where we eat some delectable dishes and not have to pay a fortune for it. The Chatterhouse seems to be one such restaurant. We visit it quite often as it is very pocket friendly and houses some of the most incredible dishes. Last Friday, I again decided to go and ordered the following-Chicken Tikka Burger- I have always preferred having the chicken tikka burger over the normal chicken burger for the simple reason that the tikka burger has a better taste in my opinion. At the Chatterhouse, the burger tasted scrumptious. The patty was soft and properly grilled with proportionate amount of veggies and overall the preparation was amazing. Although, you...read more"
957,It would become a habit before you realize. The best place for food and if you want to have an experience of lifetime visit this place when it's raining and have a dessert of your choice. My personal favorite is the coffee dessert. Yum.
958,"Loved the songs played by the DJ, One of the best audience customer friendly person.. Love the ambiance food and service ... Friendly staff 4th time here would.want to come again.. Gooooooood collection even i am salsa lover "
959,"I have always wanted to visit this place and when I finally did so, I realised I wont be going back again soon! Though the food was good, the portions are very tiny! I liked the peri peri chicken with olives, the peanut butter shake and the iced tea with Cinnamon!Dahi kebab was something new but wasn't very tasty!Its a fun place to visit with friends. You can play darts or just sit around in those comfortable couches! However it isn't anything extraordinary!! "
960,"The place is really nice with gocl to u od ambience, music and well planned seating. The food is very good. We ordered fish fingers, galouti platter and fried veg platter which consisted of onion rings, fenugreek kebabs, chilli and cheese nuggets, nachos and potato wedges. The mocktails were alos good. The only problem was when we asked the order taker about the number of pieces in galouti platter he answered 6 but we got only 4. When we asked the server about the same we were given a response that he will get back but it never happened.  Also naans and parathas were not available in evening alongwith dal makhani so we were given option to chose from rice. We ordered pulao but were served...read more"
961,"Chatter house is a great place to watch a match with friends over a couple of beers. But that's not the only good thing about it. Chatter house also serves so delicious food. Their mutton pulao and butter chicken is a must try. Also, the staff here is one of the friendliest. "
962,Good place to have a joy and pleasant meet with your friends. Enjoyed here with delicious chicken nachos with cheese and peri peri chicken. And a mock tail of coconut milk which I didn't like initially but it soothing and refreshing. I recommend this place for an evening meet with frnds. 
963,"Spotted this pub in Epicuria mall and decided to check it out. When you enter this place, its like you have stepped into a pub in london. Its a small space but they have really set it up well. To start with the waiters were very sweet and ever smiling. We ordered 6 pints for 1500 which is not really a steal deal as this is expensive as compared to a few other pubs. As most of my friends were veg, we decided to order Veg Nachos which were not the best but still tasty and crispy. It had the right amount of cheese and sour cream on it. We also had the classic Margherita pizza, though the pizza was fresh as it was made from scratch right in front of my eyes but sadly it was a little burnt....read more"

965,I was around the Epicuria food mall and thought to visit this restaurant as it has got one of the highest ratings on Zomato among the eateries present in that area.The ambiance was nice and the whole environment was soothing. The staff was courteous and they took the order with a polite demeanor.¬†What pushes me to give this place a 3.0 rating was the food.We ordered only¬†Toastadas and Choco-n-Nut Shake as we were not that hungry.The shake was good but toastadas was not good at all. We didn't felt like ordering anything else after having that.I may try this place again to try their other dishes and specialities. I just saw that Citibank benefit is applicable on this restaurant so I...read more
966,"I have been meaning to go to this place for soo long and today finally got an opportunity to go here! Well well well if you are around at Epicuria in  Nehru Place so one should definitely visit this place! The ambience and the seating arrangement here is really comfy and amazing. And the staff really helpful and polite! I ordered the fresh lime soda, the chicken penne pasta with white sauce and the veg platter and I have to say all the things we ordered were really amazing and exceptionally tasty! This is the place to go when u want to hang out with your friends and chatter as much as you want! A must visit from my side!"
967,"The location is perfect for friends to catch up. The ambiance and food is good. We tried out Mushroom barley Broth(4.5/5), Fish fingers (3.5/5), Spicy chicken tikka pizza (4/5), Classic margherita (3.7/5), Mutton Pulao(4/5), Chicken Pulao(4.5/5).¬†The serving was quick , even if it was on weekends."
968,It's a nice place to have a conversation over a drink. Food is good....with some quantity as well. Service was decent. It's a good place for a casual dinner with frens.
969,Such a cute lill place! Has a very English Pub feel to it.. Food is great!! Pizzas are really really good.. Have also tried their galouti ..which was awesome! They have a butter chicken platter which is good! They also have this guava mocktail (I think) which is YUM!Staff is better than great!Good place to chill..decently priced! The music does get a little loud as the night progresses (which I don't always enjoy) But good food always makes up for this teeny little issue I haveMust try! ~
970,"I know I am a bit late writing this, but I am too excited to write about it now also. We went to Chatter House on Mothers day, as I won some contest on fb and went to redeem the gift voucher. We were welcomed by the staff warmly. We ordered veg platter, four cheese pizza, tomato soup & chicken soup (which came with lots of garlic bread sticks). Trust me the food was amazing and pretty much enough in quantity. My mom, who isn't fond of cafes n lounges, actually appreciated the food a lot. When we asked for the bill, the team surprised us with a chocolate cake, which was heaven, actually the best I have had till date. And finally when we asked for the bill again, the waiter who was serving...read more"
971,"Really nice place. The ambience strikes a good balance between retro and modern diners, with a tilt towards the former , for the better. Great food and drinks. The Lebanese platters and the pork ribs are a personal favourite or mine. The staff is extremely cordial and the service is timely. All in all, a great place to relax , kick off your shoes and sip on an LIIT while catching up with friends . Cheers!"
972,Even if crowded your well attended . Something really love about this place . From the staff to the manager himself makes sure everything is perfect . No doubt about the food it's really nice . The bacon mac bites is my fav for which I visit this place almost twice a week . Recently tried a lot new dishes and I loved them too . Best part it's a pocket friendly place . So you really don't need to worry much grab a drink eat and just relax .  
973,"Haven't had a chance to visit the place but have ordered from them several times. I think they have some of the best pizzas I have had in Delhi. Pollo e Pesto Pizza is the best of the lot. A thin-crust pizza would cost upwards of 550 INR, which I find entirely justified for the quality they offer.¬†Would certainly recommend this place to anyone who's craving for some decent Pizza!"
974,Nice ambience good food . Ordered methi corn tikka . Nice service . Nehru Place is really becoming a definite destination for foodies . Loads of new outlets also opening.
975,A visit to Nehru Place to see the new and buzzing foodie haven in the Nehru Place Metro station. My friends and I looked away from the crowd and the mess of the food court set up and took seats in The Chatter House.The atmosphere and the service of the place transports you to a very calm and chilled out setting. With a foosball table to play while you wait for you're food to large display for Football matches.¬†The food was really good with some minor mistakes. The charred chicken was very well prepared with a soft skin. The brown sauce and zucchini added a new depth and freshness to the already soft tender chicken. Although there was a little too much of lime in the green vegetable...read more
976,We ordered the crispy fried veg platter which was good. For drinks we ordered orange sunrise which was very refreshing and we ended up ordering a second round of it. Affogatto (vanilla ice cream with¬†espresso¬†shot) was for desserts.¬†We were a bit disappointed by the galouti kabab though.¬†As compensation we were offered complimentary brownie which was awesome.The ambiance was a little dark but above average
977,"As soon as you enter The Chatter House, you are transported into a whole lot different aura, complete with a pool table, bar stools, alluring chandeliers, comfy sofas and fancy interiors. The staff is reasonably polite and the service is fast as well. My orders:1. Prawn Star Italiano2. Chicken Tikka Burger3. Dahi ke KebabsThe Prawn Star Italiano [INR 495] selected from the Specials, were saut√©ed in white wine, chilly, garlic and tomatoes, and temptingly accompanied by green salad and two slices of garlic bread on the side.

Good food, good ambience, lovely liquor menu that too reasonably priced one. pizzas are a must try, baked in an open oven right in front of ya eyes. The manager, Mr Rahul, is extremely generous in his hospitality. Makes you feel wanna come more."
979,"Was here with a German client a week back, the ambience is good if you plan on enjoying the meal but not meant for discussions. The food was 8/10, the presentation was excellent. For us the service didn't work well. That was a spoiler, otherwise everything seemed perfect!"
980,"Had a good time here this afternoon, nice place to chill out. Nice ambience, nice food. Pricing though is on the higher side.Enjoyed the foosball and dart game. As there was no waiting so the staff wasn't pushy and let us enjoy for bit longer."
981,"I have already visited this place like 2-3 times now and I would go here again if I got a chance, if that tells you anything. Entering this place you get a feeling of being in a bar than in a restaurant. But the food will change that feeling, food here is not inferior to any other restaurants. My favorite is their burgers, so if you are in the vicinity do visit. Peace... "
982,I came here specially to try galouti kebab.  It was okay. Not as good as Kebab Gali that I tried the previous weekend. Ambience  is good.. Food  is okay.
983,Located in the basement of Nehru place metro station. This is a nice place to chill... The music is good... The atmosphere is cozy.. They have a small pool table as well. All in all... A good place to hang out and have some food and drinks
984,"Excellent food and very courteous staff. The manager and Narender Goswami were looking after us and they did an excellent job from entry to exit. Ambience music and taste of food made our Saturday night special . Would highly recommend this place even if you have kids they take special care, thumbs up "
985,"Located in epicuria, right below nehru place metro station, reaching here is really convenient. I really enjoyed the food and the drinks. The ambience was so welcoming and quite. I went there at around 12 in the morning so we were the first customers. Our order was served to us really fast. We ordered a penne with vodka, nachos with cheese and a virgin mojito. Each and everything was on point and really delicious. When we paid our bill, the waiter checked if we've paid the correct amount in front of us on our table.

988,"Think Irish pubs, wooden tables, beer on tap, beer in buckets, wings & fried comfort food.The service is good, the servers are helpful and courteous and the food is even better. The fish fingers were crunchy yet juicy, the wings were juicy and saucy. Both would be recommended. Didn't try their burgers, but they seemed promising, so did the bacon mac and cheese.When one goes out to places such as these, there are two things you primarily look for - the music and the hit on your pocket. While the music was heavy on commercial English, it hit your pocket a little more than you'd like.Should you go there if you are looking for some place nice with good food in the area? Sure.

990,Chatter house in Nehru place is a small resturant with outdoor seating also available. Went to chatter house as couldn't find a place in fio or flying saucer on a Saturday night. Decent place for one time visit.didn't like the d√©cor or food too much.
991,"Nice place. The seating outside is much better than the inside. First visit to this place which I would say is a shame as they screen Arsenal games here and me being a fan have never been here before. x_xWe tried quite a few things here. Watermelon margarita, strawberry margarita, Thai martini, strawberry daiquiri, cosmopolitan, Manhattan, and beer.We only tried the starters so here they are. The pork ribs were the best. They were so soft and could easily slice it. The skin, meat and the fat was perfectly cooked. Had to re-order this as it was soo good! We had also ordered onion rings. They had become a little cold but were okay. Not bad at all.The fish fingers were the perfect amount...read more"
992,"'All that glitters is not gold' Amazing ambience with great music, this place is not one to be in for food! First thing we ordered was tomato soup, which was nothing extraordinary. It came with nice and crunchy breadsticks and some weird green chutney! Next we ordered chicken tikka, which was just fine! Then came the main course, laccha parantha and butter chicken, but we got the plates after about 10 minutes! The staff is pretty lazy and would ask you to give them 5 star ratings on zomato for a free ice cream! Well that is a steal!"
993,Spot onnn!!Guys this place rocks. From ambience to food to rates to the whole atmosphere I am in love with this place and the way it had been made. The location is a great asset anyways being right in the centre of Nehru place next to the metro station and more over between so many other outlets but they have held up well and been strong with their product. I was pleased to come to this place. Ordered bacon wrapped cheese and mac and the burger as displayed in the images and was just soo satisfied. A sure must visit spot to enjoy.

997,I have visited ChatterHouse twice in the last few months. It is a nice place located right below the Nehru Place metro station. It reminded me of MacLaren's Pub from 'How I Met Your Mother' in terms of the decor and the booths.Definitely recommend the Herb Marinated Pizza and the Chattter House/Kabab Platters.Food: 4.5/5Ambiance: 4.5/5Service: 4/5Value for Money: 3/5
998,I really like the service and ambience here. The food is also very good-loved the jacket potatoes -really really nice concept! Alsooooo I lived the sangria. Amazing! The Chatter House 
999,"Went here for lunch on a Sunday. Ordered non-veg platter with beer. The platter, though a little small on portion was delectable. The experience was topped with some good live music. It's one of the best places to catch up with friends and have a great time over good food in a nice ambience. Ambience : 4.5/5Food : 4/5Service :5/5 (courteous staff)"
1000,Have been coming here for last 3 months and it never disappoints!!!! Food is delicious specially white sauce pastas and wood fire pizzas which is complimented with¬†fabulous¬†staff members. I enjoy the open sitting arrangement which makes it a perfect place to hang out in the evening.

1004,"Loved it!!!! My friends will laugh at me, but the Methi Corn Cheese Kababs were divine and the best part of the meal which comprised of Spaghetti Bolognese and Penne Arrabiata take as well. Everything was exquisite and the portions were just the right size. We also had a Virgin Pinacolada and a Peach Ice Tea and both were very well done. While we couldn't try too many dishes, I will definitely recommend you to try it out and share your experience. We packed a lil bit of the Veg Penne and it tasted awesome as breakfast the next day :-). Plus, Happy Hours on Beers and Cocktails from 12 - 7 is an awesome deal. 1-1 on beer and 2-1 on cocktails. "
1005,Nice quiet place with good ambience. Quick service and a very helpful staff.  They have happy hours for drinks. The glasses have spectre 007 written on them .Music is good though a bit loud.
1006,Located in Epicuria mall below Nehru place metro station. This place is a nice place to hang out. The service is great and we received a warm welcome as soon as we entered the place. The menu is mix of Indian and mediterrian good. The food was nothing extraordinary . One thing which is strikingly disappointing is the portion size . Overall a nice place to visit.
1007,"This was another of discovery while strolling through epicuria in Nehru Place. Since, we were in a mood to drink and chat and the name of this place reflected our mood, so we decided to try this gastropub.The wooden flooring, bricked walls and chandeliers gave this place a very vintage British look. The pub also has foosball table and big screen for the sports enthusiasts.The seating has comfortable sofas as well high seat stoolsWe primarily ordered drinks and so food was just a side dish for us.

I'll prefer the outside sitting anytime, the inside sitting has gigantic screens for sports lovers. Not my thing üòÇüò∞! However the outside sitting has a charming rustic appeal. Fell in love with the atmosphere. Try their fire wood pizza range, fresh out of oven, literally!  I tried their vegetable marinated pizza,  or something like that, ishhh!! But it was awesome.

1010,Me & my wife decided to try this place for a quiet lunch on Friday. Since it was just 2 of us (and both are not big eaters) we ordered limited items. Butter chicken pizza - nice thin crisp pizzaCrispy fried Non veg platter - good enough to share between 3-4 persons. Nuggets were disappointing in theseGooey chocolate cake with coffee ice cream - loved it. I love the combination of coffee ice cream with a chocolate cake All in all a pleasant experience and would go back again (with more ppl) to try some more from its extensive menuP.S.- go watch Arsenal's football match there sometime 
1011,I really enjoyed the food here. Very nice ambience as well. The service here was very nice. I personally enjoyed the cheese naan Keep it up ! :) thank you parminder
1012,"The food was amazing. The ambience was calm and serene. A good place to visit and have fun, and a must visit. Everything is just awesome.Good quality stuff."
1013,"The chatter house is located inside epicuria food mall.It's a gastro estobar offering good varieties of food & beverages. The uber chic outside area is great , chandeliers add the twist to the whole environment.The restaurant is offering great varieties of dishes presented in a beautiful manner.Foosball table has been kept for the in-house entertainment.The servers make sure you are comfortable n leave no stone unreturned to satiate your hunger.Do try their winter menu ."
1014,The place is good and the setting is nice too but i thought it was a little expensive and the food was average. I ordered a platter which was quite filling though
1015,"Well , i wont keep you in the dark and wud like to tel you in d opening itself that its a dull place and by dull i mean..the staff is least intrested in catering to your needs and the food is below average. Talking of the food i would like to make a special refrene to their mushroom soup which tasted extremely bad.So for me its a No ! No!I would rate it 2 out of 5 ....(the 2 points are for the dart game they have )."
1016,"One of my friends gave his birthday treat here today. Ordered the charred chicken which was pretty good.Overalls a nice place with a good ambience to chill with your buddies.Oh and if you're a Arsenal supporter, don't forget to visit this place on weekends üòÇ"
1017,"It is a good place with a very good ambience, and friendly staff the dahi ke kababs were tooo good. Overall a good place to chill out after a long day "
1018,Chatter house is a fine cafe with amazing ambience and seating. We wanted to sit outside which was beautiful but we couldn't because it was quite chilly outside. So we sat inside which was pretty good too. The Sangria was amazing here. The vegetarian pizza is delicious. The mojito is great too. Great service. I would go there again for sure.
1019,"So i went to this place with my friends after work and was pleasantly surprised.  I instantly liked the ambience and liked the fact that it was not too crowded, or too dull, it was just the right amount. The foosball table was a bonus for me. Anyway, they have an adorable seating area outside lit up with fairy lights but they have put iron benches that make you feel like you are dining in a park. We ordered the nachos with cheese which was pretty decent. The peri peri chicken was pretty good. But what I loved was the butter chicken pizza ( punjabiness overload) and the signature lamb sliders. Both were delicious. I went home quite content and will definitely visit again.  "
1020,Visited the place with Family to celebrate my mother's birthday. Very good food and Ambience. Staf also very good here. The grilled fish was very tasty. So was the North Indian platter 
1021,Indian food was good but pizza was not worth.                                                                                               
1022,Once more i have to say that itsworth coming here again...the wood fired oven pizzas ...Wonderful staff..specially subash and padam.. serve the food with so much love.. its a very good experience...
1023,It was a good experienceLively place and platters are a must try.Value for money Although service is slow but worth a visit. Best time to go during the evening 
1024,Amazing food and good service Lively during the evenings A place to visit Again Try out the galotti platter and ravioli pasta a must try 
1025,This place stands on its own in a place where there are soo many bars and restaurants..wooden interiors reminds you of yesteryear yet makes u be in the present.. good overall ambience and not too heavy on the pocket..the staff is nice and friendly and love the beer bucket offers they have
1026,"The place is a deep contrast to the next door Flying Saucer.Chatter house is a much quiter and classier place but still remains a mixed bag with food. Nice music and hospitable staff. Amritsari fish is nice. Avoid the non very platter, instead stick to specific items. Foos ball table and dart board are a nice touch."
1027, A nice Irish theme restaurant located @ epicure food court in Nehru place with a subtle outside seating area Had some traditional sangria which was good and up to the mark  but the only drawback was that they didn't had a fat belly glass to drink  Later on had a gooey chocolate warm cake with coffee ice cream which was truly a bliss for a sweet tooth person like me Staff was calm and welcoming Will come again soon to try the food as well
1028,"Nice ambience...like a next door pub,..good music! Loved the desserts esply gooey chocolate cake with coffee icecream! Also it ws a complimentary dessert..so added to the winter cheer! "
1029,Great food..wooden fire pizza is best here..and good music too...beautiful ambience ..would recommend others to visit n enjoy great food and music..üëçüèªüëçüèª

1226,Great food and ambience! We ordered penne in vodka which was a stunner and French fries were perfectly seasoned! Portion was also sufficient!
1227,"The place has a nice ambience, but the food lacks the taste, it promises on the menu. The menu is quite extensive but I think the European dishes could be better. I did not get a chance to taste their North Indian food, but guessing from the other reviews it must be good. They have good outdoor seating as well. In a nutshell, the music and the ambience is decent, and the   Staff is courteous and friendly, food was nice but needs a little bit of tweaking."
1228,Really Good ambience....  Delicious food...  Chicken penne pasta is delicious....   Excellent service by Shivinder....  Coming back soon!!!!
1229,Excellent mutton korma platter.. nd beautiful ambience ..... exceptional and personalised service by shivinder... need to come here more often.

1232,"Generally when I go to a pub my expectations w.r.t. food are not very high, at max I look for average tasting finger food. However, Chatter House has managed to surprise me with the quality and consistency of Indian main course, do try their Dal Makhni and Butter Naan. Additionally, their good service and range of beverages adds to the experience"
1233,"I came here yesterday to have soup and snacks. I liked the ambience of the place, it wasn't very crowded and the staff was very forthcoming. After looking at the menu and talking to the waiter I found out that, they don't offer any chicken soup, but they have cream of mushroom to which you can add pieces of chicken by paying 50 ruppees extra. After having soup, I ordered a Chef Special snacks platter. Which had fries, chicken nuggets, fish and prawns along with garlic sauce. I went there with a friend of mine and we were basically full by the time we completed the platter. After the meal, we played a game of foosball kept within the restaurant. I had a really good time. One thing which I...read more"
1234,"Shivinder was a hospitable  staff. Appreciate the food, quick delivery of the order, hoping for a reasonable bill :PI would like to mention that the ambiance is appreciable too."
1235,One of the elite place near to my house. A perfect venue for party and dinner with friends. Ambience is lucrative and impressive. I only ordered few items but was impressed with the quality and quantity. Try sometime. 
1236,"Very good ambience for watching football matches,  ....must visit place if your are an arsenal fan and great if its a derby with spurs...and yeah the food is good too"
1237,Really nice food & as an arsenal fan loved the environment......... A must go place..............Come on you gunners!!!!!!¬°!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1238,"A very delightful experience at The Chatter House. A cosy, comfortable and courteous environment here. Food is enticing but might be a tad overpriced. And being an Arsenal enthusiast, this is a really apt place to be in- they screen matches! And if you are going there, hope you get served by Shivendra. "
1239,It was an amazing experience. The staff is absolutely supportive and agile to the customers. The ambience is amazing. Would love to be back here

After that i have been there many times and i simply love the ambience and food. I love their platter which they serve with a portion of dal makhani and bread. Awesome! They have a foosball table right after you enter and i love it! Must visit place in nehru place! "

1245,"This is the second time I'm coming to the Chatter House. The ambience is beautiful, they play pretty good music and the food is always great, especially the Pub Classics. What is great about this place is that it has Indian as well as non-Indian dishes to choose from, which gives the guests a lot more choices on the menu. "
1246,Amazing food. Amazing ambience. Would like to come here again. Good value for money. Nice starters and great mains. Servers are good and prompt
1247,Service r gd . Liit awesome. Ambiance good. Veg platter nice. Service given by Shivendra is excellent and like his politeness. Sitting arrangements r excellent
1248,Love the ambience and the music played. Staff is extremely hospitable. In my last 7 months of my move to delhi this is the most frequented place thus far.  Two thumbs up for The Chatter House  
1249,I went to chatter house with a friend of mine...I really loved the place..the ambience was amazing. I am vegetarian so felt that options were less but the pizza and veg crispy fried platter was awesome. The quantity and quality of food was up to the mark.
1250,"Good place, amazing Karaoke on thursdays.. :)  Had a server named Narendra, pretty good on service, prompt and patient.. :) But chatter house needs go improve its liquor availability, you can't run a place without Old Monk or other dark rums & also regular brands of beers like Corona .. That's just missing out on the basics.. "
1251,"Ideal place to sit back and unwind for people looking for a break from 'normal' Delhi scenes. Really impressed with the service - attentive, prompt, yet not in your face. Thank you Narender! Note to owners: Would be absolutely perfect if Old Monk was available at all times. "
1252,"Amazing ambience. Loved the food. If you love outdoor seating, then you should definately visit The Chatter House. The staff is great and very polite.Will visit again."
1253,Horrible place....rude staff...pathetic service...willl never recommend and will never visit this place again. Service is so pathetic that we have to wait for rotis for half an hour...food below average.... mismanaged.... capable of ruining your evening/occassion/celebration....
1254,Nice place to visit!Really nice chilly something platter. Fuss ball was a nice cathe.Surely visit this place and get served by bijender...
1255,Bijender gave awesome service! Nice place to hang out after work!! Fussball table adds a nice touch.. The food is great too.. And nice music!

1259,Great service. Outdoor seating is good. Food is great. Very amzingly fantastically superbly mesmerizingly awesomely awesome place to chill out of with friends.@subhash
1260,"M so glad that i went to this place yesterday evening for dinner. This was my first time and i was extremely happy to b there. Whatever we ordered was served without a single moments delay . , i was with small kids and was very apprehensive but the setting was kids friendly too. Ordered pizza, non veg platter fr starters and was surprised with non veg helping as it was very generous as compared to other places. I also found it easy on pocket . Our main course had dal makhani, butter chicken and paneer dish..awesome all was . Drinks were nicely done and timly served. Service was as good as food. Keep it up guys. :)"
1261,Situated right at the corner in the most talk about place of Nehru Place i.e Epicuria.went in with my friend and ws delightes with their Happy Hour menu.Food was also good and they serve wood.fired pizza . Staff is quite good and attentive.Great place to hang out with friends for quick booze.
1262,Delicious food and awesome ambience soft music soothing atmosphere one should definitely come and experience its food and softness the service is also very quick and very welcoming 
1263,"Want to have an excellent evening this is the place to be,  amazing ambience great service special mention to Mr Narendra Goswami,  his service was amazing. Keep up the good work guys :) MUST TRY!!!!"
1264,English decor..tucked in the corner below the metro station....it's very inviting and cosy. Must have the Galauti kebabs accompanied with a glass of wine.
1265,From a long time I'm thinking of going here but today I got time to check this out so find less crowded which I think gud we can think easily what to order first I try chocho frappe as suggested by staff n then I go prawns star italiano well marinated with white along with garlic bread the that prawan star Italian seriously a 5 * rated quality love  I must come again for this n many more things 
1266,"Been here on a Thursday night for the first time. Great ambience, warm staff, cool music and amazing food. What else would you ask for? Was a karaoke night on Thursday so kindda cool. We ordered Indian cuisine - tomato basil soup, dahi kebabs and blue cheese naan with dal makhni shots (yes black lentil shots!!). Their soup should pass the most difficult test of gourmet food lovers. Kebabs were ok, but dal makhani was superb!! I strongly recommend this joint for ambience, music and innovative food presentation."
1267,"I felt the place to be very classy from its interiors to lightings to tables to crockery, everything has a standard and it does not fall in that part anyway. I felt that the food they serve is less in quantity and the taste as well. I had a pasta done in pesto sauce which was extremely less as per my likings of the pastas. The taste too, was like the other places only. It is among the one-time visit places for me."
1268,"It's a cafe with yummy food! We loved almost everything we had ordered here .. We tried pesto mushroom filled toasties, pasta in red sauce, herb margarita pizza, pasta in white sauce, burger and dahi kababs along with bloody marry, sex on the beach & cold coffee. I would recommend to have dahi kabab and burgers here - they are really good.Ambience- cafe style but a lil darkFood - very goodValue for money - good"
1269,"Great service plus awesome service, thanks Bijendra. The apple cider beer and margarita pizza are a favorite. Reservations are hassle free. The music is great and we loved it here. We planned to be here for an hour but ended up staying for 4. "
1270,"I have been a regular to chatterhouse and its a great place to chill out post office hours. Good food, vibrant crowd and a nice outdoor seating for smokers (in case) I've tried all the platters at and they are good, special mention to crispy fries veg and non veg platters, we always ordered back to back of those Another standout was onion rings, nicely done and crispyAside I haven't found any issues with food yetWhen it comes to drinks, I found the place lacking stock of some key beers several times, sangria is pretty good thoughWill keep on visiting the place"
1271,"For last 2 years i have been visiting this place regularly for lunch.the menu is very good filed with tasty food.but above all the staff is super, especially Subash...Cheers!!"
1272,The ambiance of the place is very good..... The cusine is good..... Place to drink and dine..... Place to have a nice romantic dinner in calmness and in a nice music....Jaskiran Kaur 
1273,"last Tuesday been to this place, decor give u the vibe of London British pub they have out side area as well we tried there risotto and fish and chips food was awesome. staff is very friendly and helpful, manager padam his just so helpful to fill needs."
1274,It's all about food. Just hope in or get it delivered. The food is just too yummy. And if you have not tried it yet. I can assure you that you will never ever think twice to have the food there again. and wants to come for my beer and burger for again and again.....very friendly staff specially the manager who make you the visit them if you are around NP.
1275,"I was very impressed with the ambience of this restaurant. It's exposed red brick walls, green coloured cushions and brown woods are a treat to watch and enjoy. But the food was a disappointment. There was nothing exceptional about the food we had. We had Amritsari fish fry and keema naan with beef in it. Both need a special touch to it. The keema in naan was nowhere to find. It was a spread in very small quantity. The naan was too oily and unnecessarily thick. "
1276,"When I got to know about this place, I was keen to visit this place.I visited here with my friends for the lunch. The interior is fresh. Sitting inside and outside, added an advantage to this place. The food is amazing. And staff is really cooperative. Beverages are totally fresh and refreshing.For those who wanna try new place for great food, it's a must try place."
1277,"Great good and staff.. Amazing Indian Food with some excellent service from Bijender.. Good music, good food and good ambience.. Must try if you are in Epicuria!"
1278,"Well I came here with a friend of mine given we had been to check out the Epicuria food mall..So we landed at The Chatter House.The very first thing that caught my attention was a guy dressed as a British armed guard(the ones the big hat). As soon as you enter,  that british vibe is continued with a Pub themed wooden decor with ample indoor and outdoor seating area. Classic rock music playing was an added advantage to pick this place..Moving on to the food, We had the-Mini Lamb Stuffed Naans- Four small nans filled with a scrumptious lamb filling served along with a Finger licking good salan(oh this was so good, a coconut based salan with curry leaves) and cucumber raita(fresh, thick...read more"
1279,visited multiple times...Awesome ambiance...very good to visit during office hours...the range of cocktails is good...and the service is also very impressive...
1280,"Fun and cozy place with a rustic feel. The food is great and when I went there wasn't too many people making it a quiet and refreshing evening. Oh also, There is a fooze ball table! "
1281,"Not a very good experience, this place is crowded if i compare it with flying saucer near to it. Maybe the menu prices are on a lower side which could be the reason, food was just decent, ordered something they get it in breads. It was mushroom mixed with sauces and got it in bread, better i would say a mushroom sandwich, bread wasnt soft, dip they served wasnt good at al. Got peri peri chicken ordered which seemed half cooked and got it replaced with fish fingers but they looked more like the mccain strips.Coming to drinks, ordered a cocktail pitcher which was full of ice and when questioned, waiter said LIIT picher contains 90 percent ice..Mojito pitchr comes with 70 percent ice as...read more"
1282,"Chatter house is my favorite for a group get to gather with my friends. The overall ambience is good, I like nachos with cheese, ceasar salad and amritsari fish."
1283,"Accessibility: very easily accessed by metro. This is situated beneath the nehru place metro station.. Ambience: very nyc.. Though nothing new and different but it accommodates all genre of people casual friends, work friends. Since I wasn't there for long and couldn't taste much over there.. But still got a chance to hog over their nachos which were just amazing. My friends who stayed over and had pasta also praised about it.Disappointments: i don't have anything to mention as a disappointment in this place except signal which is in turn good so that one is not disturbed by phone calls.Verdict: must try place especially with your gang of friends!! "
1284,went chatter house for the first tym.. ive been to many cafes and restaurants no body was as promising as chatter house... awsumm food... no fancy garnishes bt still they stood apart... food is really good... i ordred bbq chikn wings... juicy lucy burgr... and choclate cake with ice cream.... evrythng was perfect... it is value for money... i congratulate the team.. they r doing a great job...
1285,Chatter House has been done up keeping in mind the colonial pubs that still exist on the streets of london specially Covent Garden and the other adjoining areas replete with wood and leather sofas.Conveniently located in Nehru Place metro station that offers numerous options to suit every taste and budget. This place is neatly tucked away before Flying Saucer and Opp Beer Cafe. The decor has that old school charm about while fussball table provides the youthfulness to the decor while giving an option to engage in some serious gameplay. The food is above average and definitely better than few of the places in the vicinity. The wood fired oven pizzas are a must have along with Keema...read more
1286,"A nice and heart warming place to sit and chit chat with your loved ones..... maybe one of the best places to gang up and have beers.... food is good there Chatter house Fries are must try..... for all potato lovers.... the chef is sweet and always look for your opinion to make your food better.¬†The best thing about this place, that makes your entire experience so good is the staff, rare to find but the staff here is extraordinarily sweet / helpful and warm. Thanks to Mr Goswami for making our experience so wonderful. we have actually gone back twice / thrice coz of Mr Goswami's good hospitality.¬†Keep it up !!!"
1287,"After first coming to this place when it opened and not finding any alcohol due to no liquor license, we decided to put it on our wishlists.¬†Came to this english styled pub on a saturday night with friends.¬†right beside beer cafe, sometimes i feel that would have been a better choice.¬†We ordered one of the few beers that were available, since most of their tap was empty.We ordered the crispy fried veg platter as a ""chakhna"" to our booze.¬†The platter was a little bland, and felt incomplete, making our booze feel as a runner up's prize to a competition,¬†The place was fairly occupied, the beers were cold (thank god!) we chose the high chairs for seating.¬†the music was low...read more"
1288,Really good food. Amazing ambience. The only reason that brings me back here again and again. Highly recommended To all the foodies @subhash 
1289,"Great place to chill with friends. Staff was polite and friendly. We had chicken tikka masala, amritsari fish fry which was tasty. Dal makhni was creamy and yum yum. Will come again! "
1290,"As the name suggest the place is ideal for chit chatting. The food is definitely sumptuous, the poisons are perfectly prepared, the staff is friendly, overall a great place."
1291,"Want to hear the chatter about chatter house? Well you came to the right place. Nehru place is super close to my home and now I wonder ‚Äì Why did I not go to the place before? Located in Epicuria it has a feel to it which no other place has. Ambiance ‚Äì The ambiance of the place is very welcoming and warm. It is has a fun vibe to it. With foosball in the corner. You get a fun feeling to be present there. Slight music which I am sure turns up on Saturday night. Popular music was the main forte. You should definitely go there with friends. If your date is fun, take a bench outside and enjoy. Food ‚Äì From the drinks to the food everything was fantastic. The chicken wings were...read more"
1292,"Outdoor seating is cool. Food is good value for money. I've tasted their veg/non veg fare and can recommend it. In essence, it's a very fine place to unwind with friends and colleagues over drinks. Prices aren't exorbitant and service is pretty decent..."
1293,Went der today fr a frnds bday... we ordered chatter house spcl LIIT.. looked gud.. wid a fancy presentation but din taste well .. staff ws kind enough to replace it wid regular LIIT.. which turned out good.. loved the thin crust pizza nd i highly recommend it to ol d foodies... Veg kabab platter was gud too.. In ol gud ambience...yum food.. well trained staff.. value fr money 4/5...!
1294,"In recent times, this has become my favourite place. Completely in love with the open area, it's so comfy and chilled out. Perfect for a good time. Coming to the food, last time we visited, we ordered the spicy chicken pizza, the penne vodka, and the pork ribs. Everything was amazeballs. The pizza was one of the best I've had. The penne vodka is a personal favourite and totally recommended. I end up having it every time we go. The sauce of the pork ribs was super yum! Also on one occasion we had the Goan prawn curry with rice and beans toran. I couldn't stop wanting more of it. Really lovely place with amazing food. I'm a regular now! "
1295,Went their today to celebrate the birthday of (two) friends. The food (I only tasted Pasta and Pizza) was delicious (the people with me were also all praises about the food) and the staff was super friendly. (We made a lot of noise there while playing the Darts and Foosball üòÖ.)

1297,A chilled out place with English bar like seating and chandeliers. Dim lights and house music renders the place a warm and cozy ambience. See pics attached. They have happy hours uptill 7.30 which is like one hour less than other bars in vicinity. Food tasted good though the servings are small. Peri-peri chicken is a must try.Had heard a lot about their open seating and wood-fired pizzas that they make in front of you but that was humid day so I preferred indoors. Service was ok and nothing to boast or complaint about. 
1298,"I'd surely go back to this place for the music, the food and the pleasant ambiance. It's a casual lounge - and is buzzing with people on any given evening. We ordered - pasta, garlic bread, prawns and stuffed chicken with basil and olives. It was just perfect for a casual dining experience.Must order - the keema Pav , kneaded in butter and spices this dish stands out. "
1299,"Had a get together at this place. It was having nice ambience and cool music to go with. They have set up karaoke and anybody can sing on the song they like. Amazing food and the service was also pretty good. We ordered Italian, North Indian. Food was really up to my expectations. I would really like to visit this place again. "
1300,"Absolute favourite place to visit when it comes to epicura. Love the way they've done up the restaurant. Always play great music (usually the classics) which let you talk to the other person in peace and doesnt force you to scream over the music (something which So many restaurants in delhi force you to do)Their thin crust pizzas are decent. Nothing special however their burgers are truly delicious!Starters completely outshine everything else you order no matter what cuisine it is. Highly recommend the chicken tikkas.One of the few places still serving steak, however while they manage to get it right usually, they do occassionaly get it wrong. To them all steaks have to be ""well...read more"
1301,"I was in Delhi for the weekend and was wandering around when I saw this place and went in. Sadly they won't serve me alcohol as I am not 25 (loving Bangalore even more now). But the waiter Narinder was very supportive after he denied alcohol and served me quite well. I ordered chicken stroganoff and nachos, they were really good. Liked this place,ay be will visit again in 3 years when I am 'legal'."
1302,"Been here many times; has been our meeting place. I can count numerous meetings with office colleagues, friends and so many others. It has always been fun. Food has always been nice. We had once sat outside as well. Music is never too loud and the DJ (don't remember his name now) knows his music well. I remember how we have enjoyed hours of foosball and pool here. A must have to hang out with friends over good food and drinks. "
1303,"Chatter house is an awesome place for hanging out with friends, specially the foosball table.Although they do not have many options in beer but for that you have beer cafe adjust to chatter house.Their Mojito is awesome.Thumbs up for Chatter house."
1304,Good place to chill with friends and have couple of beer nice ambiance food quality good awesome place to enjoy the evenings at the outside seating. The staff is really good . I would love to compliment one of the staff member called Subhash . He is a very pleasing personality and always welcoming and advice with good food :) Keep up the good work . Cheers:)
1305,"The ambiance is all woody & well designed, Its a great place to sit, talk & drink. Menu prices are decent, moreover they have happy hours & they didn't charge any additional service charge. We Ordered just french fries & Crispy Veg Fried Platter & some LIIT, Quantities were decent enough for two & food tasted good. Services was fast for crowded place like that. Will visit again. 6 LIIT & 2 Dishes Cost 3300 inclusive of 600 tax."
1306,"The ambience is nice. But the food is not good. I've always been there just to drink. To that end, the chatter house is good. The service is decent, so you wouldn't have to wait around unlike so many other places. "
1307,"This is a so-so place. Drinks are okay but the food is not that good. Moreover, there is space issue. For a casual drink, you may try this place"
1308,So this place reminds me of a busy pub in New York. It is really good for drinks and food with friends or work buddies. Service is quick and the servers are good too. Their pizzas are a must try. They offer a good selection of alcohol. I usually prefer sitting outside as its a little less noisy during rush hours. 
1309,One of the best bars I have been to in Delhi . I love the ambience and food . Unlimited choice of drinks with late nite happy hours and the tasteful rocky music makes this place extra special . There is no way one wont return back here . 
1310,"Had a nice experience on karaoke night. Good ambience. Good service. Consumer friendly. More sign boards should be there on these kind of events or on special offers, if any. Looking forward more of it."
1311,Had an splendid evening this Sunday. With the lots of positive feedback thought to try this place and it was worth a visit. We ordered tortilla chips shredded with cheese and Potato basket with mushrooms and Feta which were delicious . Kin-Royale made it a perfect combination followed by Indian platters. There are lots of options with great taste and enough of quantity. Nice place to hangout. Kudos to The Chatter House Team. :)
1312,"Chatter ambience.. Outdoor seating is nice for cool months, the fireplace for making pizzas add up to the ambi.. Must try but service is a bit slow but great.. I ordered Tostades as starters and Falafel burger and a Herby pizza.. Plus the drinks.. LIIT was perfect they also have spl. Chatter house LIIT which gets a kick from the red bull. Music was awesome and put us to groove.. Nice place to  to see time coming to a standstill.. I guess the beer üç∫ made... "
1313,went for my birthday bash .. food was good..but was lil bit on costlier side .. the table soccer was the + point in the restaurant ..would like to visit again 
1314,"Awesome food, great service and a Foosball table!! Must go!Ambience : Charterhouse stands true to it's name. A concept long lost in my life has just sprung back thanks to them. One can actually talk and yet not miss out on music or the pub culture! Just the way it should be - an actual social place!Food : The Hidden Star of the menu is definitely the Keema Pao which was sumptuous! We also tried the Amritsari Machhi which was tender but can get more flavorful. The Caesar salad was just perfect !Beverages : Happy hours are a real treat 1+1 on IMFL and 2+1 on Foreign liquor from 3.30 to 7.30 !!Service : An amazing team! The whole team is friendly and warm. From the smiling and...read more"
1315,"We booked a table using the Dine out app. We ordered a mix of Indian,  Italian and American food.  All the items were great and the flavour was nice. Only a few tweaks to Paneer Tikka masala will be nice. Otherwise the experience was nice. Music played here is very good. "
1316,"Love this place! Food, Ambience and Service all 'A' one. Though it is a pretty small rest bar, but i just love being here especially my friend. This place is more or less always full and Seat reservation is something difficult to get. This place is surrounded by many other good outlets but it is just the aura of this place, which makes it better than all. I am quite regular here and trust me, it is an experience to be there. Will recommend to all!"
1317,"The place has lavish yet sober interiors. Perfect place to hangout with office colleagues or friends. The staff is nice and knows quite a lot about the food they offer. Moreover, the food plus few pints of beer won't burn a hole in your pocket."
1318,It's not a place you'll bump into until and unless you've heard about it prior to your visit. It's a bit hard to locate this place. The ambience is that of a typical pub with a few uncomfortable booths but we were lucky to find an empty couch which was pretty comfortable.The pork ribs were heavenly. The charred chicken burger was also delectable. It was a great night overall with the foosball table and darts.
1319,"Just for starters - I'll just Say this review is My take, and was biased on the situation and company I had too (to an extent) ... A quick dinner -with three familial adults.Though my dad forms an equally good food critic- it's blatant n blunt for him! A dark almost-cosy place, really well done n coordinated interiors- bar,DJ, foosball - just the place itself as a perfect ""vibe"" going - would have been a perfect decision for my American aunt , maybe not so much for the Kolkata relatives :) it almost made me really miss on my Pune days & friends... Service- they seemed a bit lost to start with (with not a crowd to please though) -but they came around eventually.Dad was turned off as the...read more"
1320,"Chatter house is a nice place to hangout with your friends. I somehow like the name :) The seating style is comfortable here. I really liked the open bar area. Also, there is a pool table, foosball table and the best part of the pub is the seating outside with garden metal chairs loaded with cushions. Quite different :) And, when it comes to food, my friends and I ordered a pizza and a pasta. Just the perfect pizza we had in a long time! It was freshly baked thin crust served with the right amount of toppings and cheese. Delicious i must say! Btw, all their pizzas are worth a try!Overall, this place is a must visit if you are in or around Nehru place and want to catch up with friends...read more"
1321,"Ambiance is nice but prices are a bit high, fooseball is fun and party is rocking there. Specially at the time of Fifa matches. One time try for sure..."
1322,"The super fast service and heart thumping 80's rock music make it a perfect go to place for a dinner with friends. The pizza is well baked in a thin batter filled with all sorts of toppings that one would relish, the French fries basket is also a surprise with liquid alapeno' cheese on top served with some sweet and tangy salsa sauce."
1323,"Good place, great service, nice music and new offers!! Come visit and feel yourself coming alive after a hectic Thursday schedule.... Nachos are also very good and can be coupled with a few chilled beers "
1324,"Guys go out for a all new exciting menu at The Chatter House, amazing great food with the best hospitality ever. The service is just amazing. Especially the hospitality by the staff. Goswami rocks..... Keep up the great work "
1325,"Good food,great Ambience,good place to hangout .great music and service. Serve one of the best pizzas , sandwiches,platters.its great place to spend weekends with friends."
1326,"Great drinks - try winter toddy if you have a cold, like one of us had. And try the green tea cocktail whose name I am too drunk to remember right now. Stick to tostadas when you want to just munch on something and try to be served by bijender."
1327,Had been here with partners and office colleagues. It has great ambience and good food. We were served by bijender he was kind and quick to response. 
1328,What to say about this place...  Excellent food.... The manager Mr. Padam is a thorough gentleman... Good staff...  Superb ambience...  A very relaxing and chilled out place... 
1329,"Being a foodie is not easy! Not only it adds to the food bills but also to your weight! :p I have my weekly cheat days when I go out and indulge! On one of such days I landed at The chatter house!The ambience is decent, nothing to notice twice! I did like the fact that they have an actual wood oven ! I had instantly decided to call for one of their pizzas! Called for the chatterhouse vegetarian platter and the herb marinated vegetable pizza! And ice tea to help gulp it down!The platter was good! Paneer was on the rubbery side! Lacked that tandoori flavour! Humus was nice n fresh! Onion rings were like onion rings! Nothing special here!The pizza on the other hand was nice! Had that...read more"
1330,Ok place to hang out with friends ... They have nice risotto and garlic bread .....you can play also along your drinks ....if you are in Nehru place and didn't get good place in flying saucer then chatter house is a good option ....
1331,"Chanced upon this one during a visit to Epicuria.. The place offers nothing great, nothing out of the box.. An average place offering average food and average music.. The pizzas and pastas are safe bets..¬†They have a foosball table though to break the monotony (Extra points for that).. Pricing is on the higher side.."
1332,"Went to this place on a weekday, not many people there. It is somewhat of a sports bar. We ordered onion rings, dahi ke kebab, chicken wings. The dahi ke kebab are awesome here.Overall the food is good, a bit costly though.Food-8/10Ambiance-9/10 "
1333,"Was on my bookmarks for a long time.Average service, average food, good ambience.Didn't find it value for money. It's overpriced for the quality and taste they offer.The portion size is meagre and the food isn't something that'll blow your mind.We(3 people) ordered the Chatterhouse non-veg platter which had decent variety but the food was lukewarm and not very filling.Had to order more.Had their vodka penne which didn;t taste of vodka in the least.The only thing which was good to have was their¬†Herb Marinated pizza which is saying a lot considering I'm a ¬†hard-core non-vegetarian.Won't care to go back."
1334,"Was dying to go here since it opened got a chance to go last week. The place was not very crowded and the music was ok. We were three and v had ordered a few beers(5), a veg fried platter and a cocktail. The platter was disappointing and v wanted a draft but it wasn't available. Our bill was around 5600 which I think was expensive. "
1335,"Great place to hang out, though slightly expensive. The Mac and cheese I ordered reminded of the classic authentic American taste. So woohoo for that. They had limited options for beer, though. Hence the 0.5 deduction."
1336,"This was my 1st visit to chatter house. When i reached there on Friday evening the place was full so i left my number at the counter and 10 mins later they called me and i got a booth for 4 people. My wife and my friend and his wife were there for a lovely experience. We ordered LIIT pitchers and ordered a tandoori platter, nacho with cheese, french fries, onion rings. The food was OK and helped us to cope with the gallons of alcohol we were having. I loved the ambience and the staff was polite and helpful. The place gives you a feeling of old pub charm. The music was nice as well."
1337,"Good food with great ambience. Perfect for EPL lovers. You can enjoy the match with warm service. Tried Galouti Kebeb platter - 4.5/5 ; Peri Peri Chicken -3/5; Garlic bread with cheese -4/5.  Cosmopolitan has very well made - Wifey had 3 üòâ. All in all, nice place to chilax on Sunday evenings. "
1338,"Call it bad timing or misfortune but whatever we wanted to order there was nothing available ""out of stock""...but the substitutes were decent enough.. Ordered double decker chicken burger excellent juicy chicken but the burger was  small in size after for the label""double decker"" but it had two chicken patties which were juicy enough.. Could'nt order dessert as i was not ready to substitute that .. Recomended. "
1339,"Nice place with lovely ambience. Vintage framed posters with beautiful chandeliers adorn this place. Service is good. Lovely outdoor seating too. Hd virgin mojito- it was really good, fresh lime soda- not so good, wood fired herbed vegetarian pizza- thin crust with fresh vegetables, it was awesome, veg main course platter- good and filling and lemon cheesecake with ice cream which was lovely too.Overall a great place to hang out with friends."
1340,"I remember visiting this place initially when they had launched it and did not even have a liquor license.Though I wanted to grab a beer and wanted to leave for somewhere else,the courtesy of their staff and the respect of their manager made me try this place..And since then I have made 3-4 visits here.They play some good english songs...The food is pretty good.The salads are really great.If you want to chat,eat,play some fuse ball and have a fun filled evening then this is the place.Staff is very interactive and warm...And now they serve drinks too...."
1341,Good place to chill with friends in the evening.. Was here to catch the PL match.. The food is good and alcohol is slightly on the expensive side. 
1342,Chatter house is surely a place to hang out with friends. Some food items like agliolio pasta and ravioli are really tasty but the platters were average for me. The music played out there is good and adds to the ambience.
1343,"Lying at the corner of mall, this place amazed me so much.. apart from such a good ambience the food was simply great. Nice outdoor seating. Reasonably priced menu and friendly behaviour of staff makes you stick there for long chats. Must visit for a soccer/cricket lover on a match day! "
1344,Nice place for lunch with your date or friends. Food is really good and ambience too. I came here few weeks back with my friend and we both really enjoyed our date 
1345,"Well this place is set up not as nice as you would expect,however the food and the service make up for it. It's one of those rare places in Delhi where the green section in the menu is better than the red one. Don't miss the jalape√±o cheese poppers!!"
1346,This place is the best place to catch up with your friends and clicks with a chatterbox like me! One of those rare places who know their music and their volume to keep the chatter going. The food menu does justice to hunger and serves the satisfying quantity! The drinks and the ambience are perfect cocktail for a memorable experience each time one visits. Just came back after Friday chilling with my chatterbox buddy :-) keep the music playing and thank you for the wonderful ambience Tushar Vaidya 
1347,"I just go here for the happy hours.. On friendship day I went with my friends,I clearly remember last two glasses of wine were left to be served,the waiter said only one is left I said no 2 are left to be served..I went to the other waiter serving me before,as I was talking to him the other one came & said "" aapke pass bahut free time hoga mere pass nahi hai. Ek he glass bacha hai.."" I didn't complain that day but just look at the way they treat their customers.. Food is shit.. Not even a single thing that we ordered was tasty.. Plus the rude behaviour of the staff.. "
1348,"Been there so many times since last one and half years, the location of out side is Awesome and the Service being hosted by Mr. Goswami is just outstanding which forces us not to choose any other near by restaurant over The Chatter House... awesome "
1349,Superb place. Lovely Interiors and great food good crowd and amazingly well mannered staff. The bar gives you an old English feel.Drinks: They had replacements for ¬†anything not on the menu the ¬†way it should have been.¬†Food : Way too good.Music: Now this could be very specific to each one of us but they were somehow playing my all time favorite list so i loved it.A great place Must visit
1350,"Staff is very energetic and makes you feel comfortable. But the food is not good, there are many better places in the vicinity. Won't try it again."
1351,I was there last sunday with my best buddy on freindship day and we enjoyed a lot..... Specially arsenalv/s chelsea and we ordered humus and pita and weat based quattro pizza and trust me the pizza was awesome and drinks was nice...... Cool ambience and perfect lightings and good staff...... A must go place... 
1352,The Chatter House - a superb place to sit & chatter for long. Nice ambience... lovely English music... and yummy FOOD from broccoli & cheese medallions .. to paneer tikka (mouth melting) to penne arrabiatta to never ending chocolate mousse desserts were really really good... Delicious!!!!!! slightly pricey but still A MUST TRY! :)
1353,"This was my first visit to The Chatter House which is actually located right next to my office but I never got time to explore the place.The Gastropub has a lively ambiance with chic and attractive interiors.We ordered Onion rings, Chicken Penne, Virgin Mojito and an Apple cooler.The drinks were totally refreshing and the food delicious.One of the places which I have really liked based on the food, ambiance and complete experience. Plus its not very heavy on pockets, so I will definitely would be visiting it more often.. "
1354,"Chatter house is an amazing place to visit specially if you are staying in South Delhi and prefer traveling by Metro.. Step down at the Nehru place station and that's WHR u can hit this place. Music, Food and service I will rate it 4.0/5 .. The main reason for me to visit this place is its outdoor seating devoid of any external forces disturbing noises and that u can smoke dere. In winters they have the coal chimneys installed nearby which is just awesome. "
1355,"Well the place is loud but hell yeaa the music is awesome!!!! And so is the crowd and staff. We ordered aglio olio pasta and sun dried tomato and pesto ravioli. These were chef's special and she's done complete justice to it!!! These were just too goood. We also ordered the chatterhouse veg platter but did not like it much. Has mostly fried snacks, and that too mushroom. Paneer got cold too soon. Hummus was not flavorful. Mocktails were okish. You can certainly have better ones in delhi. Also ordered the galouti kebab plattet that came with dal makhani and naan. Im glad it did as the dal and naan saved the dish. Galouti is toooo soft and certainly not the best in taste. "
1356,"I have been to this place thrice and have been more and more disappointed with their service and food quality with every visit. My experience on last visit:¬†¬† - The fresh lime that we ordered ¬†was too salty and of room temperature. The staff got it 'remade' twice but the taste remained more of less the same.¬†¬†- Our food took almost half an hour to arrive. If there was anything in our order that was high on prepare time, the staff should have informed us while taking the order.¬†¬†- The gulouti kebabs, one of the dishes that we had ordered, was undercooked and tasted of raw mutton. When we mentioned it to the chef who was taking feedback from the guests, he took the remaining...read more"
1357,Love it love it...music is too good! Awesome crowd. Excellent choice of appetizers n mouth savouring drinks! Perfect to hang out wid ya boy gang n wid the ladies!!
1358,"My favourite Resto CHATTER HOUSE.....¬†I have visited there many times.. each time i go there i got carried away with the great vibe all around.I suggest everyone should go there to experience the ambience over there.Guys i would like to recommend a guy who is working there at CHATTER HOUSE ""Narender"" trust him & he will be serving you the greatest delight..Totally satified... 5.0.¬†My Jack Daniels thats all i need..."
1359,"Can't believe I ignored this part of the city, and remained stuck in HKV and Khan for the last month and a half, after returning back to India. This place has a very very cool ambience, and left me deeply impressed. Beautiful layout, very nice ambience, brilliant food - very awesome in fact, the only reason they miss out on a 5/5 is because they can really improve their service by many notches. But all in all, everything else was so perfect, that I could not pinpoint this. Had an amazing time!"
1360,"Their outdoor seating is awesome and indoor is close to aweful. Prices are a bit high but if you are an alfresco person, you wont mind. Service is also good."
1361,Checked if buffet is available  for lunch..  But they have stopped doing buffets ..  So kindly update the site.  Seems a recent development and so thankfully checked with the restaurant before reaching there. 
1362,"Ordered chicken strongoff here and my friend ordered Thai red curry. Quantity did not disappoint, taste did not disappoint, price did not disappoint. It's a nice place and I will try to come here again"
1363,"Went in for a drink and some snacks.Ambiance:¬†Great music, chilled out vibe and relaxing seats.Food:Ordered the following:Fish n chips: The fish tasted a bit funky. Upon telling this to the chef, the manager happily replaced it with a Chicken tikka.The chicken tikka tasted out of the world!!Spagetti carbonarra : Really good. We added bacon, which made it better.We washed it down with a Sole and EdingerThis place has great food, good service and ambiance.¬†Thumbs up!"
1364,Great ambience i was amazed to see it. Evening time z best time here. Its great to have drinks n watch league matches here. Staff n services are good. 
1365,"Well there's a lot to say about this place.The ambience is great,the food is even better.The main course veg platter served with dal makhni and 2 portions of bread is mouth watering.The butter naan is tender and just melts in your mouth.The chatter special crispy veg fried platter is just as tempting.The onion rings were delicious.Also enjoyed the hot chocolate and wild garden moctail.Wild garden packed taste of guava,mint and mango.Its a flavour blast in your mouth.The staff is courteous but service is not very prompt.Be prepared to wait for your food which will be in the end worth the wait.Try to avoid the berry berry shake which tasted more like cough syrup.PS:Hope I haven't set your...read more"
1366,"This is one of the best outlets that I have been to, the food is awesome, the ambience is great, the music is good & the staff is very professional, courteous & friendly. Kudos to the outlet manager Padam for managing the show so well & treating every guest so warmly. This time we were serviced by Narinder & as always were impressed by his courteous behaviour & recommendations basis our choice of food."
1367,A lovely place to lunch or go for appetisers. Great ambiance to enjoy food and drinks! Toothsome food. The tandoori chicken and galouti kebab player are amazing. It serves fulfilling meal. 
1368,Amazing ambience! Been here with couple of friends and had an amazing time having drinks and enjoyed some really well cooked italian food.. Had a great experience..
1369,"It is combination of great service excellent food, which is very rare these days. Many other outlets and restaurants in the same vicinity lack in either of one. Keep up the good work!"
1370,"Place with good ambiance, and music . Evenings are the best time to be here. They make Pizza's at live Oven. Pastas are brilliant. Loved the way how Chef was going to each and every table and asking about the food and open to changes. Bravo! To the chef. "
1371,"Firstly the best part is the lack of telephone signal which is like a natural barrier to all snobby youths of this generation who can't live without their handhelds. And the fact that I can enjoy my food in peace without any calls disturbing me. Also if you really need Internet they've got free Wifi FYI which is fine enough.Second time visiting. Their Signature Beef burger is like the best burger I've had in a long while. It's just how I like my burger, moist and medium rare beef in d middle, gooey and messing up your hands sauce and well balanced flavours all around. Nothing like it. I read how some customers complaining of dry burgers. That's because they order well done tenderloin...read more"
1372,It's wasn't planned at all... But that was the first time I visited euphoria mall.. We went to chatter.. For its outside appearance.. It looked more happening then others! And well.. It is indeed a very nice place.. I have some special chatter chicken steak.. And it was worth it plus beer and quite few more dishes.. It's slightly expensive but worth visiting..!! 
1373,"Cool place. Great ambiance, good food although the service was not that great. The waiters were courteous though , and paid heed to our complain. Had a good time with my husband and friends. The ¬†vegetarian platter was good and the pizza ¬†was also pretty good. Music was also cool and the pricing was also not overwhelming. All in all, good place to have some fun time with your friends."
1374,It is a nice restaurant with outdoor seating. Liked the good variety of cuisine as well as drinks. The tikkas were awesome and main course was sumptuous. But they do have limited brands of foreign beer when I visited.
1375,"""The fried vegetarian platter"" this is something I ordered out of hunger yesterday! But trust me I found bread roll of my working place way more better than this costing fortune blunder.. üòù #disliked #unhealthy #snack""Bubblegum vodka shots"" a must try... Yummy little thing..!..."
1376,"Recently visited this place but my personal opinion is it's overhyped I specially went there with my family but the food was average trust me.dont try there bacon wrapped Mac was hot from the outside and chilled from inside & cheese,BBQ pork ribs I felt they weren't fresh & were tasting weird & smelling and were not well done and charred chicken was raw from the inside felt disappointed."
1377,"This is my saturday afternoon chill out place or at times an after office beer drinking place with my colleagues. Love to order their Vegetarian and Non veg Platters, both of which come with plenty of options. Flavors are not bad when paired with drinks and conversations. Went there this weekend for my usual afternoon affair and ordered their Crispy shrimp basket with tartare and a pepperoni pizza. they make their pizzas in a wood fired oven which is placed at the back near their outdoor seating, where I usually prefer to sit. It came piping hot straight from the oven and was well crisped with bubbled edges, really good sauce and melting cheese.¬†The crispy shrimp basket was however a...read more"
1378,"Attention to details always makes a big difference. Starting from the outfit of the doorman to the polite behavior of their staff members, this place instantly leaves you with an impression. Could not try a lot of food but the risotto was an absolute treat. Very filling as well. And like the name suggests, it's an ideal place to sit and chat with your friends. Just in case you don't want to, you can play some fussball. The music is pretty decent as well. Location is pretty awesome. Right at the basement of the Nehru Place metro station(Epicuria mall). Must visit for all chatter boxes, food lovers and life lovers."
1379,"Chatter House is my staple go to ""resto-pub"", since the day it opened. With Nehru Place as my workplace and my home a mere 10mins drive away, Chatter House is the most convenient place to go to. I love their English pub decor, and the little patio at the back is perfect for those cool weather afternoons. In terms of food, I think I was only disappointed once, with one of their desserts, which we sent back. But the Chef came out immediately, took our feedback and had it replaced. Almost every time I go, either me or someone in my group ends up ordering the Fish and Chips! English pub, fish and chips, beer... makes sense, right? Chatter House does breaded fish but it's crispy and fresh and...read more"
1380,"Undoubtedly our favorite little joint in Delhi. We are pretty much regular here given that it's barely 10 minutes drive from my home and also because they serve one of the best beef steaks ( And exactly medium-rare, the way I love it with a dash of pink when I cut it) in Delhi ! I have tried beef steaks( buff steaks rather, since you won't get beef steak in any restaurant in Delhi) in at least 20 different restaurants in Delhi , and the two best places would be Chatter House & Hard Rock Cafe, Saket. The other dishes like the Non veg platter & the fish fillet burger are some of my favorites here. The best part though is the awesome music set ( classic & alt rock mostly) played by the DJ...read more"
1381,"I visited Chatter House this weekend since I heard a lot about it. The ambience and service was uncluttered and smooth. Saving the best for the last, I had ordered Bacon wrapped Mac and Cheese and Feta cheese salad and both the dishes were amazing.The only problem I faced was that I wished to pay through Ruplee but the connection was such a major issue here. I hope you guys look into it and rectify it.¬†Looking forward to an amazing evening sometime later."
1382,Chatter house is another TGIF and a bit more. The bit more is for their patio seating. Food - it's pretty good. But I would not go there specifically for the food. Ambience - so this is what takes you to chatter house. It's a great place to spend an eve with friends over beer and finger snacks. Friendly staff. Neat / no frills interior. The patio is lovely for winter afternoon / eve. Price - you won't gasp at the bill. What you see / get is what you pay for. No complaints.
1383,"I visited this place yesterday evening with a friend. It is a pub true to it's name. The music is loud and the tables are close and the place is dimly lit. So you have to talk loud. You can hear the murmur around from other tables but the loud music drowns it partially. So there is constant chatter that you hear.It is a lively place for a evening party or celebration. Mind you the price mentioned here at zomato is underrated. if you have an average appetite and want to have a cocktail each for two people, it will cost you Rs.2500.The food is nicely done, service takes around 30 minutes. The staff is polite, though they were very busy as the evening progressed. We ordered a margarita...read more"
1384,Love this place. Come here too often and will continue doing that Love the ambience..the music and the service. Especially the hospitability of Padam and Neeraj.Food is as good as everything else!
1385,"Great place to hang out with cousins or friends. The food,ambience and music all are nice. Visited the place a couple of times with friends and every time we have a reason to go back which itself says that it's a place to try at least  once."
1386,"A lovely place to spend your evening. Spacious and interiors provide good ambience. Very much unlike pathetic beer cafe which is just opposite to it. Unlike beer cafe, service over here is amazing, staff is friendly and they also serve really tasty dahi kababs and veg pizza :-) If u r in epicuria and in that lane, Chatter house is the place to be and beer cafe can be simply ignored. Had a pathetic experience there and Chatter house ensured our evening was not spoiled."
1387,"Yummy food, good service... There is nothing average at all.. Which is impressive since most places these days manage decent food without impressing. The chef was checking on customers himself which was a clear indication of his confidence on his food..:)..Must have.. Pita platter.. Hummus to die for!. , goan prawn curry.. Though our was more mallu in taste than goan.. But still impressive. And for all those snotty US returned.. Genuine fish and chips eaters... This is where you go.. Though a little too bland for me taste... But the snotty ones with me liked it.. Slightly pricey but Good second sizes too..All in all.. 2 thumbs up.. Go.:)"
1388,"The Chatter House is a good enough decent place to go and spend a good time with your colleagues, friends or your special one. The place had good music, a little loud though. The food was good and plenty of options in drinks. We went there for our Office Team party and everyone enjoyed a lot since the place has a sort of semi-casual ambience.Plus, to bring out the player in you - the restaurant also has a mini play-zone (foosball, darts, etc.) which kind of rejuvenates you for the fun ahead.

1391,"Visited dis place on a Saturday evening. We reached around 7:35pm and D place was almost empty dat tym so we easily got d table for 4. The happy hours were over but still the guy who was attending us took our order under happy hours. We quickly went thru the menu, ordered 2 sex on d beach cocktail (2+1 Free), virgin mojito mocktail, peach ice tea and Choco n nut shake.

1392,"My wife took me to her fav place chatter house. You will notice a secutity guard standing outside dressed like a British soldier. This pleace has lot of English/British touch. It has a brickwall interiors, a fooze ball table and a big screen. It is one of the best places to hangout with friends to watch your fav sport. They play house, edm and RnB types of music. They have a Big Bar with sitting decks.We ordered Nachos salad, french fries, pasta. Food was absolutely authentic, and rich taste. I liked the way the food was served, it was very unique. Now the most flawless thing about this place was its indian main course. Generally you cant expect a lounge to offer you great Mediterranean...read more"
1393,"So this is a review on my first visit. I went all by myself for a meal. It's a lovely place,  the outdoor setting is beautiful. I chose to sit outside as it was raining.  I ordered a virgin mojito and penne vodka. The pasta was nicely prepared and I loved my meal. I want to add that the staff treats you with a lot of warmth. They offered me a complementary desert and apologies that I was already full and couldn't have it. I am sure the decor,  and awesome food will keep me coming back for more.  Thank you team I had a pleasant evening. "
1394,"Chat Chat Chat Drink Eat Chat Chat! I really like this place! Its lively, well priced, good service and tasty food! A perfect place for an evenong hangout wih friends/colleagues over a couple of drinks and some really tasty snacks! Don't miss the sliders!"
1395,"I have been a fan of HIMYM for quite some time. The first time I went there it just felit like Mc Laren pub of HIMYM. The ambiance is great and the music is super great (if that can be an adjective). Now comes the food. Well, I hardly revisit any place and I visit chatter house once in every couple of weeks. Just love the food, ambiance and the staffs are very courteous. Once we reached there at around 12:10 at night in a group and we were still greeted with warmth. Their steak and fish filet burger I absolutely love . "
1396,Very average food and cocktails . The staff needs training .In my opinion the greatest attraction was the pool table . The problem lies in the mushrooming of lounges and bars and the staff lacks training .
1397,"Short review- monthly visitor, tried everything on the menu. Everything is above average. Slightly pricy, worth a few viaits for anyone. This place is good. This is the one of the few places where after you're done you think "" I have to get all my friends here "".We entered for lunch and there weren't many people around. Some good classics were playing in background which is a great sign.We sat down and I ordered a aam panna vodka cockail which was in the seasonal specials and because it intrigued me. We also ordered their charterhouse veg platter to start things of. The paneer tikka could have been.a little better and wasn't as good as the one I tried at that Sanjeev Kapoor...read more"
1398,I liked Chatterhouse vegetarian platter the only thing to dislink in it was onior rings very oily. I tried a gauva and ginger mix drinkcalled the wild garden mocktail which was good to taste with basil leaves. I had hot choclate ot was good and thick and sweeeeeet. Ambience was great. Cool place to hagout with colleagues and friends. Slighlty high priced! Not pocket friendly. You must try it once & spent time playing a few games.
1399,"Went there for dinner yesterday. We were given a table near the entrance which we didn't like. Besides, the music was too loud.So we decided to sit outside. Wrought iron chairs were very uncomfortable but I used a cushion which made it better.Our server was apparently new and seemed like he needed training. He wasn't much aware of the menu. Since there were 2 of us, and not in a mood  to drink,  we ordered a Greek Salad and a chicken burger specified with potato wedges, not fries-they offered a choice. After ordering my salad I realised I needed a more substantial meal so checked if I could change my order. The server came back with my salad saying it was ready. Ok then can I have a...read more"
1400,"Well, the ambiance of this place is very good, and they have a good menu. We ordered fish sticks, and i didn't really like it, the chilly chicken was sweeter than usual , but the beer was undoubtedly good( as per my friends cause I don't like beer). The staff was very polite and the service was quick. Everything was good , except the food."
1401,"It wasn't easy to locate this London style pub but navigation surely helped. Tucked away in the extremes of the city, this place is aptly categorized as the hidden gem. Red bricked walls and paintings will surely catch your attention. On a Friday night, I arrived just in time to grab a table.Its so calm, polite,mesmerising that sets your mood and blow away all your stress. The ambience is perfect to relax and enjoy drink and food with your close ones.¬†We ordered for a kebabs platter ,which tasted like those perfect mint chutney with of course certain enhancements .It was a real nice gesture but then we had to ask for a chutney for it,which the guy got in like another 10 minutes . the...read more"
1402,"Lets talk about the pluses first, Biryani and Chicken Galloti Kebab platters were really tasty, quality and portion were upto the mark. I really liked the presentation of food and overall taste. Ambience is good but somehow I found it a bit dark honestly, intially we were made to sit in one corner of the restaurant which had a broken spring sofa and we only got to know after we sat :) but we were quickly moved to a better table soon after."
1403,The ambience is nice but their food isn't as good as the ambience. The servings are too small. We ordered a non-veg platter and were disappointed at seeing the size of the food on the platter. Half the drinks on the menu were not available and their music was too loud which made it difficult to hear each other. 
1404,"This place is exceptionally good. Located right in the heart of epicuria mall in Nehru place.Not only the location and ambience, but the food taste and presentation is exceptionally awesome.One place where you can actually enjoy a romantic dinner.  The staff is so courteous specially hostess Sujata and their chefs who will ensure to take you to a wonderful journey of quality food in terms¬†of presentation &¬†taste.The food at the chatter house was impeccable specially indian cuisine.

1405,"I visited this place to catch up with an old friend after a good while . The place looked promising and had nice music and seating . The ambiance was decent . We ordered veg caesar salad and cappuccino. There was nothing outstanding about both and they served very oily breads with the salad . We were told we could avail some discount if we downloaded one particular app and pay by card and we agreed . However , one of the staff was standing on our heads till it got downloaded so it got sort of awkward . Even after downloading it though , after so many efforts ,their were some technical issues . Overall, a nice place to have a good time and chatting with friends , not too sure about good...read more"
1406,"One of the best place to hang out in Nehru place... The food is awesome, penne in white sauce, herb's pizza is a delight for vegetarians.. The music is great so is the staff there . They have outdoor seating but prefer only in winters since its humid most of the times... Overall a great experience & yes! They offer 10% corporate discount, all you need to do is give your visiting card. Happy dining :) "
1407,Me and my wife been there on last sunday and its been our first visit to nehru place and unfortunately dropped down to the chatter house. as we are from kolkata for food i ordered fish for me and my wife ordered charred chicken for her as she was bit scared before ordering.¬†¬† Till the time food came we had a round of the place and it was fantastic done with wooden flooring and lovely outside sitting area.Then came the best part food.Nice presented and the portion was bit on the lower side coz it was so delicious that after having that you would love to have more. In the end for saying thanks i called the server to call me the chef and then a very professional person is been came to my...read more
1408,"Seeing the awesome reviews and ratings for this place, I was excited to visit this place and had a some expectations from their food. But that didn't turn out too well. First the positives, the ambience is nice. Staff is polite and attentive and the service is quick. The chocolate frappe is real good. And the cold coffee is nice too. The pasta however was sort of bland. The cheese balls were okay. We never got to try their pizzas which they claim is their best dish. Probably a second go only for that. Pretty average place to me otherwise. "
1409,"Second visit, first review. The decor is very English with a chandelier and outdoor seating. They even have a couple of games in the corner while you wait for your food. Staff is very nice and ready to assist you. Food is delicious. Their vegetarian platter is just amazing. Only thing that bugged me was the menu for non alcoholic drinks. Could have been better. It is full during most nights. So reserve table before going there. Small but elegant place in Epicuria. Highly recommended. First visit for a football game screening. Food was still good, but there was no commentary with the match, so I was a little disappointed. Should be avoided if going for a screening as the music is too...read more"
1410,Food is lovely! The ambience is lovely! The veg platter was the highlight! Absolutely loved the mushrooms in the platter! They were yum! Liked the pasta and nachos as well! Experience was really good!
1411,"Really good ambience. Went there for lunch on a Saturday so it was quite crowded. The waiter who served us unfortunately wasn't the best of the lot. He acted as if he was doing is a favour by serving us. So that was a downer. Now coming to the food and beverage, What we ordered:Strawberry milkshake - Very average. Had more milk taste than strawberry. I couldn't even taste the strawberry in the drink. Veryyy bland. Definitely a NO!Fish fingers with tartar sauce- very crispy and yummy fish fingers! A good replacement for the fish and chips if you're not too hungryCharred chicken with sauteed veggies- absolutely delicious! The chicken was very well done and the sauce was lip-smacking...read more"
1412,Food: perfect..Tasty..forthright Ambiance : OK..can it b better.Everything is perfect.Right place to hang out with friends.I dont knw Y they stopped serving Bubblegum Vodka..
1413,Food: The food is very nice. I have had Italian here and the experience has been wonderful. Service: People are helpful and pleasant. I liked the service. Ambience/Seating: It's a good looking restaurant. The ceiling is a three dimensional nexus of triangular pyramids that protrude downward. The seating is comfortable with cushioned sofas however the distance between the seat and the table seemed a bit too much. You can't eat when your back is touching the backrest. Value for money: Uhmm this is always a difficult column for me. But you can say no. This is because though the ambience and all is good but you can get a better place in Hauz Khas village at the same price.Go for: Coffees....read more
1414,"TCH is quite a decent place when you want to chill out with your friends. The place has outdoor and indoor seating. I went with a hunch of friends and initially took the outdoor seating, where one can also see the wood oven pizza being cooked. We ordered a spicy chicken tikka and onion pizza, the chatter house chicken risotto, cheese garlic breads. The pizza was really good and one must order of one their pizza selections if they come here. The risotto was also good, except I found it a little bland. For drinks we ordered a beer on happy hours and a watermelon red wine sangria, which was great!! The service was a bit slow. Price wise pocket friendly place. Overall a good experience."
1415,I am simply in love with this place. This place serves one of the most delicious burgers you can find in Delhi. The service is prompt and the staff is really good.
1416,"Been here a lot of times...the place has a great combination of good food, good ambience and good service... The staff is polite and welcoming... Love their pastas and pizzas... The combos are also good and the drinks they serve are quite interesting ... Yet to try the burgers..."
1417,"Platter was yummy yummy...except dose onion rings :/ but overall amazing :) staff was very co-operative in suggesting items,service and ambience were good too"
1418,Very impressive i would say... i was searching thru zomato to find a decent restaurant for north indian food... finally thought of trying chatter house though was not expecting much.... to my surprise the food was really tasty... we tried murgh tikka masala n daal makhni which was finger licking... tandoori fish was also abv average.. APPLE AND BASIL MOCKTAIL is a must try... i have had many mocktails at many cafes... trust me this was real refreshing!!!! The sevice was fast nd the ambiance was fun :)
1419,"The Cozy Nook - A nice place to catch up with friends! Its cozy and comfy to chat and have really yummy food. They have amazing pasta and garlic bread which you could opt for without a blink.Their pizzas are freshly made just for you, fire oven baked, thin crust and lots of love. Their pizzas are pure sin. You could build up your appetite with their lovely nachos.Their Bacon Wrapped Mac n Cheese is a lovely cheesy escapade you must try.The staff is super sweet and helpful, which will your experience better.One of my favourite places to soothe down the senses! "
1420,Good place to hang out. Nice menu friendly staff. Try wood fired pizza .. Beverage section needs a push up. Location makes it up. Next to metro ample parking
1421,The place gives you a really good Irish pub feel. The food is fairly good and the drinks are even better. But the thing that makes the place worth going back to every time is the ambience and the staff. They make you feel comfortable and take pains to make your experience worth repeating. 
1422,"Didnt really got to eat or drink anything here courtesy the chatter house management.On a Wednesday evening at around 8 when there isn't any real crowd these people couldn't offer us a table for 4The problem isn't that ,but the attitude.Nobody is bothered while we are trying to locate a table and even while we left not even once where we asked what on earth we were doing inside.Thank god for saving our evening as such an ignorant staff could have only been a disappointment."
1423,"The Chatter House, a place to be more than once......it has a great ambience and music. It is the food quality that will drive you back to this place again and again. Even simple french fries tastes so good at this place that everytime you are done u'll feel that i wanted to try everything on the menu. The Burgers are limelight at this place. Just one recommendation is to improve the preparation of Non-Veg ceasar salad, which i have had at multiple places and that too better ones...."
1424,"Chatter house is one of the classiest bar in town. To start with the ambience, it was kind of cool and it suits the mood. This is the ambience where you would love to hang your boots and relax yourselves with a mug of beer. Coming to F&B this place offers wide variety of both.all drinks from all over the world are available. I tried BIRA and I must say its a must try. Smooth and have an awesome taste. Food wise I tried veg over there and tandoori veg platter is good.. Service was too good and the staff were courteous. Price wise it was a bit on a higher side and let me tell you it was worth it. Every penny well utilised and It's a place where I would visit again. Cheers to Chatter House...read more"
1425,I loved the chilled out feel to Chatter House The place reminded me of my after office drinking evenings in Mumbai ! The Bangers n Mash was good !
1426,"If you have  come here for great food,  then  you would be fairly disappointed.  Their signature burger is a disappointment, in terms of size as well taste. But on a brighter side,  great ambience, nice loud music,  drinks  are good,  nice crowd. Overall a decent place to hang out with  your gang and may be play a game of foosball. "
1427,"Chatter House is an amazing place if you are looking for some time in solace. It's been more than a year that I visited this place, hence not sure about what we ordered there, but I do remember our experience, which was superb.Great ambiance, good food which doesn't even burn a hole in your pocket and amazing drinks. Must try."
1428,"This place is a rare combination of perfect music, ambience, food and service. The staff is wonderful, make you feel comfortable, very polite specially Narender he rocks, i am a regular there becuse of him. He deserves some kind of appriciation  for sure."
1429,"It has now been over a year since I visited this place and I'm slightly hazy on the dishes we ate there, but I'll try to get it all back. Chatter House is located in the Epicuria food court in the basement of the Nehru Place metro station on the Violet Line of the Delhi Metro and is easily accessible via the metro train service and indeed by road. It has a fairly large space to accommodate diners and has a British pub-like interior but still remains a very good option for those who don't take hard drinks. The other USP of this restaurant/pub is the incredibly huge list of items on their menu, all of which are invariably available. To hazard categorising this eatery, I'd say it offers a...read more"
1430,"Went there for a little hangout, grabbed a few drinks and liked it there. Comfortable furniture, nice music and dimly lit ambiance. I asked for cosmo, but they didnt have em. But cool place. Would like to go there for some food some time soon"
1431," Good food, great ambiance. Nice music. Reasonable prices. My kind of place. If you looking for a good place to chill out, this is it. Excellent service by Narender."
1432,"Went for dinner on saturday night with my teetotaler friends to this place. should say that the ambiance is great. And food was good though the serving size is on the lesser side. Service was pathetic. they ignored us for the first 20 min, then they forgot half our order and served late. When we complained about the choco nut shake contained just peanuts, they jsut shrugged it off.We ordered Shrimps, penne white sauce pasta and cajun spiced pizza¬† - all were good. Only the choconut shake was a disaster"
1433,It is a fun place for fun ppl. Food is great and burgers are too good and so are their drinks. The berry berry shake was definitely not good. I would consider visiting this place more often. 
1434,As i was in epicuria mall i decided to visit this place.  I had Penne arrabiatta pasta which was not upto the mark.  However the  falafel burger was good in taste. I also had fresh lime soda which was quite good it is also served nice.  The place is so lively.  The staff was also courteous. 
1435,"Dropping by for a few drinks to Chatter House on a Friday night was just the perfect plan. The ambience was really nice with. Their taste of music, I must say, was definitely impressive. We ordered their Chatter house special beef and lamb burger, chicken nuggets and Cajun Spiced Chicken Pizza. Since, I don't eat beef(till now), I didn't eat that huge burger but my friends slurrrrped and relished each bite of that burger and definitely loved it. I loved the chicken nuggets which was dipped in honey mustard sauce and was amazing. The pizza portions were really filling! Thus, overall experience was nice only that they should have some more beer options the next time! :DTried them again and...read more"
1436,Great ambience....the place was buzzing with really good crowd. Ordered the veg platter and a few drinks. From the platter dahi ke kebab was the best of the lot. One of the best I have tasted. Drinks were nice too. Really nice place to chill around specially with the ipl fever on.
1437,"Thumbs up for the music, food, service and ambience. Happy that Narendra who was our server took great care to make sure we had a good time and even helped us to order when we werent sure what was good here. The cheese balls with the yummy dip and the bun omlette were perfect. Wud love to visit often ."
1438,"Super awesome place...great food...excellent service especially Narendra..who served us really made us feel valued for chatter house. The prices were reasonable, food great, drinks remarkable and services flawlessl"
1439,"I personally loved the ambience. Very polite and friendly staff. Great food, do try their pasta. You'll fall in love with them :) beverages are pretty decent too. "
1440,"Great service, good pizzas other food the portions are very small, they can improve on their cocktails specially sangria. Good outside seating area and really good music. Salud"
1441,The starters for buffet were really good. The options for desert were very less. 
1442,It has a nice ambience and the food is pretty good. I liked the pasta (penne with vodka) and it was worth it. Music is pretty good. All in all a decent hangout place. Service is on a slower side but the staff is pretty good. 
1443,"The ambience is awesome, food is also good. They should work on stocking the beer which they have in menu. The DJ played really nice songs. Its a nice place to sit and enjoy the beer with your friends and can definitely request some songs if you want from the DJ. The platter was not that awesome so try the kebabs and pizza. "
1444,Went with my gf for lunch and ordered non-veg platter but got potatoes n onion more then non veg which is quite funny ull regret ur order!! worst food!! and worst service..!!! only ambience is good!!!
1445,Nice place to sit and there was a large screen for us to watch ipl match . We had a nice happy hour deal . The ambience was nice and had good seating arrangements
1446,Been here 3 to 4 times now as I love it's ambience. This is one of the very few places where I get KF Ultra Lager. Apart from the drinks the food is also awesome with good proportions. They also keep serving peanuts with the drinks and I find those simple salted peanuts an amazing combo with the drinks.
1447,In one line ~ good for drinks not food The place has a good British ambience ... Music is nice and soothing ... Options for drinks are fairly good but the food quality and  quantity is disappointing ... Took me good 15 minutes to decided what to order .. After struggling with the menu i ordered barbecue chicken and it was a bad choice to make as the quantity was fairly less as per the price and also the taste was below average ...
1448,Sounds good. Terribly expensive. Call before arriving if they have the requisite drinks. Surely better places for a Sunday brunch in Delhi. Not worth the time/money. 
1449,"A great place that has indoor and outdoor seating. With a froozeball table and English decor, Chatter House is a happening pub at epicuria. The DJ plays great music that gives it a nice foot thumping feel. Haven't tried the food there so wudnt know, beer is good. Priced a lil high, but wid the whole buzz rnd it is worth it! A great place to chill.   "
1450,Fantastic Food specially cheese nachos ?? just loved it ? surely will visit again ? the starff was also good and service is also in time always
1451,Okkkkk the chatter house Starting from food everything they bring on table is presentable ooo the delicacies of food is always astonishing . Gulping food with some good music is so gratifying. And as the name says go with your friends indulge your food with music   And chat with friends ? 
1452,"Never seen a handsome doorman attired in a red uniform :-) and I entered with a smile. The place was impressive, with both indoor and outdoor settings. We ordered barbequed chicken ( which was great!), juicy burger, pasta in pesto and pizza. I would say that pizza was disappointing. Nevertheless, had a lovely time chatting at the Chatter House :-)"
1453,"Very Brit style decor, with old English reggae music, the likes of Boney M filling up the place, again the wooden and red brick finish but along with old advertisement picture frames, leather couches and bar stool seating, foosball table, indeed you get the feel of a Pub as soon as you step in! What captivated us the most was -the outdoor seating that was decorated with lush of green, water fountain, garden metal chairs and of course the wood fire oven! Servers were hospitable and suggestive! They had coffee promotion leaflet on the table as well, with crazy combination of coffee and liquor, some classics and Affogato as well, that i will definitely try out on my next visit!

1454,"Being English at heart down to the very core, i was invited by a friend after the fashion week, and was pleasantly surprised when i wound up at this quaint place with a very British tenor, with undertones of an Irish pub, interiors in wood and brick , walls adorned with mesmerising pictures which add to the ambience of the site, with an equally alluring outdoor with a live fire kiln.Very snug, welcoming and mellow feel overall. The cuisine is equally exciting, with ample amount of variety. I ordered charred chicken with brown sauce,with rosemary potatoes and grilled veggies, all done to perfection. this was the best brown sauce i ever had. The rosemary potatoes tasted divine with the...read more"
1455,very nice ambience nicely presented food service was quick. had a wonderful time and will surely coming back. nice burgers and fish fingers and onion rings were perfect.
1456,Been there on monday night very nice ambience ¬†but as on it was sunday so most of the tables were empty. very warmly greeted by the hostess. ordered some starters and main course and was very happy with the quality and quantity of the food. service was bit slow but as all we know good food takes time. didnt enjoy the pasta too much rest was good. definately coming back
1457,"Another one of those cafes which is high on ambience but serves terrible food. So I went to chatter house with a couple of friends. The whole place has that classic wooden stakehouse feel which is visually appealing. They even have a outdoor seating and a huge screen set up for the IPL matches. But  ambience is all that chatter house has to offer. Even though the have quite a few things in the menu, the food turned out to be really bad. We ordered bbq chicken wings, nachos with cheese, veg pasta in red sauce, a chicken burger and a lamb burger with a few beers (they were having happy hours) and a mojito pitcher. The chicken wings were Raw and hence, disgusting. We even asked the servers...read more"
1458,Really loved the feel of the place. Awesome music played. Food was okay. Drinks were fab! Loved the white sauce pasta. ??Falafel wrap is a disaster.

1460,"Chatter House was the host for our tournament and it was a pleasure to be here. The place is amazing, Great food and excellent service. Pizza is one of the best I have had in town. Would love to visit again. "
1461,"Ordered ham and chicken pizza ,was cold and the cheese was stale,hard mutton seekh kababs ,ordered bira beer from the tap was pathetic ,it tastes amazing in beer cafe which is next to it.Chicken malai tikka was not badI wont go again"
1462,"A nice english look restaurant... Service is good... Its gives you a total UK feel... Food is nice... Value for money.., definitely like to visit again and again "
1463,"When I was asked to meet for drinks and dinner at this place I was quite skeptical. Simply because my memories of this area where we now have the Epicuria mall in Nehru place was that of many years ago - full of dust, pollution and traffic. But surprised I was to find a lovely mall right below the metro station. Even before I entered the restaurant I took a liking to the place...a nice refreshing collection of interesting eateries. As for the restaurant itself, loved their cocktails (for most part), shrimps were just finger licking and so were their selection of Galauti kebabs and non veg platter. Am certainly visiting this place again....sometime soon."
1464,The first thing that you notice entering is a British royal guard with long hairy cap(God knows what is it called)  that gives you a feeling probably the set up inside is that of British imperial style. However the interiors inside is that if a cafe bar with retro-90s music. But hey the place offers very well laid out seating space to give you your own personal space within the chaos. The finger food is nice. The place doesnot pinch on the picket. Good hangout with friends. 
1465,"Heard a lot about the place and really happening place to be there with family and friends . Superb brick wall ambiance and food and drinks are really superb .. Simply one of the best ... Tried Manhattan , chicken with peri peri and pig in a bucket and waoo so yumm . "
1466,An average pub with the only good thing about it is being cost effective!Happy hours on weekends too till 7 30 pm! Food- 2/5Ambience- 3/5Only visit this place if you are in the vicinity and want a cost effective place to go!Even then I would suggest mybar@gk.. It's awesum!
1467,"Located conveniently at the hottest and most happening epicentre called epicura, this place is difficult to miss! The ambience is a typical brick laden contemporary bar - Cafe. An amazing place to hang out with a huge group on days when an amazing cricket / football mat h is going on, though of course, that would require a prior reservation. The food is good enough, though the menu feels restricted ( no non veg options in ravioli , less options for fish in main dishes). However the jumbo Jucy Lucy chicken burger was absolutely amazing. They have great happy hours offer. The bill was moderate, not to expensive. Would surely love to go there again with more friends :DRe-visit : amazing...read more"
1468,"I will straight away deduct one point for the disappointing service. I mean from the moment we entered we had to ask for everything - glass of water, plates, spoon fork knives, to call someone for order. This was very irritating.Coming to other things. Well frankly ambiance is damn good with some lovely music played. We ordered double Decker chicken burger which was very filling with nice fries and fresh veg salad. We also ordered white sauce chicken penne pasta which was awesome. Licked everyt last bit of it. Yeah I found pasta amount slightly less as compared to the price.Guys pls work on ur service.rest of things are awesome."
1469,"I have been wanting to try this place ever since I saw the food court it is in. The interiors are beautiful and remind you of something very classy and vintage. The bar is very attractive! Straight to the food because I just can't get over it, dishes that I tried:1. Chatter house special french fries- 4/5 (Delicious jalepino cheese topping served with salsa sauce. Yumm!) 2. Onion rings- 4/5 (Crispy, huge, right on point!) 3. Penne arabita with chicken topping- 3.5/5 (It wasn't the best pasta I had had, but I couldn't really find a flaw with it.) 4.

Had an amazing time over there the seat was in outer view that looks so filmy. The bar section has so many variety we were served starters that was so mind blowing. We had cocktails and mocktails along with platters. We had a house special molecular cocktails ‚Äòsangria Esfuma‚Äô it was mind blasting. The food was fab whatever we had was so perfect in taste and in presentation, staff was very sweet and professional."
1471,A sports lover delight. I went there specially to watch an important EPL Game between man u and man c and the big screen was showing that game instead of the usual ipl.  There were many manu supporters cheering. The service was prompt. I ordered veg platter and Nicole salad with Virgin mojito and everything was well prepared although they should add more variety the platter. Overall an enjoyable experience. 
1472,It's a descent place to be in..... As per the drinks are nice  but the jugs are filled with a lot of ice.Frankly you have to change the glasses ....A LIIT should look really big or at least Long!The extra 1 rating is for he mouth watering DAL makhni and Kawaab platter..... It's something that you have to have in Delhi it's very very very nice !!!! :)Try to get the seat outside which is definitely more sexy than inside.
1473,"Good music, lively atmosphere and a cooperative staff makes this place enjoyable. And it's always nice to have complementary munchies being served. Multiple seating options is always a plus which makes this one of the most visited places in Epicuria."
1474,"Don't know about the others, but it gives a proper feel of a typical NYC bar. I've been here     thrice and I've always tried different food. One time I tried butter chicken with naan, Lol. Yeah coz I was craving for it. I found it to be pretty delicious. I've chugged on beer the other two times, tried a couple of their starters and it found them to be nice. The classic fish and chips was amazing and their non Veg kebab platter too. Burgers and pizzas were all up to the mark. They've recently become home to the Arsenal Delhi Supports Club and have been hosting match screenings. I was quite impressed and a revisit beckons."
1475,Chatter House Non Veg platter and my watermelon martini made my evening beautiful . The chicken was amazingly cooked and humus wid pita bread was perfect. The martini made me feel refreshed as it was crisp in my way.  Staff is awesum and amazingly friendly loved it
1476,The staff was quite patient n sweet...food was good bt pizza was out of the world.the crust of the pizza was not like d regular one..infact it wasccheesy and very thinAnd mocktails were nice too...
1477,Our first gastronomical experience at epicuria mall and it was worth every morsel :). We checked this place at Zomato and decided to spent a lazy afternoon at this place. The menu caters to almost all cuisines and have platters and combos so that its shareable and is easy on your pocket.the drink menu too is good with awesome seasonal cocktails. We tried their aam panna vodka which was refreshing and their kir royale is yummy!! The non veg platter is nice and the freshly made pita bread adds to the taste. We also had keema pao which was again head on on taste and presentation. For desert the gooey chocolate cake with coffee ice cream is a must try. The outside sitting area is a better...read more
1478,"It is a nice place to hangout.Good food, good music.I just loved jalapeno cheese balls with pesto dip.We liked their veg tandoori platter as well.Service is good."
1479,"Went there the weekend before last, when the Arsenal v Newcastle game was on. First of we were super impressed by the fancy  Nehru place metro station which houses the Imperial mall. The ambience was great with house full of the Gunners faithful. The starters were decent, we ordered the veg and non veg platters, chicken wings, humus and pita bread and fries. They were all ok but not great.Most of us were having beers so cant say much else about the drinks, except that some of the fancy sounding cocktails that my friends wanted to have were not available. For mains I had the beer burger which was pretty good.Price wise it was pretty descent.End of the day Arsenal won so I had a great...read more"
1480,This place seems to be a good place to hang out for few hours if you are totally in freak out moodI find very vibrant environ r inside keeping you engaged with sports channel and DJ music .. Over that their food is quite refreshing and good in taste .. When I left that place I felt myself energetic as compare to the time I entered ...
1481,"An experience at times leave you so impressed that you live it for a lifetime, such was the case with Chatter House . Invited to a Bloggers Meet a few weeks ago I visisted this place with a friend who is a ultimate foodie. This place is situated in the busy Epicuria Center at Nehru Place Metro Station, The wooden enteranbutce itself promises a irish touch of the place, inside the place has a vary formal sitting arrangements, however, its spacious so you dont have to worry about people over hearing your Gossip. They also have an isolated outdoor siiting area, so Romantic couples add this one too in the list. :PThe Bar is good with a variely of drinks and Mocktails, the best part I...read more"
1482,"Disappointed is the word , waited approx 40 min to get in and ordered Lebanese burger that was not at all good , we were in a group of three neither of us took the second bite ! Then got that replaced with a Paneer burger that was just full filling our hunger need but didn't tasted good either ! "
1483,Great menu ensemble.. Good prices.. Interesting drinks.. A perfect place to chill.. Even on weekdays.. So you can understand how comfy this place makes you.. Recommend this over monkey bar which makes you deaf by the pure noise which they call music..
1484,"Visiting this place was an example of how a coincidence can get you to a nice place like this. It was an invite to a foodie meet organized by askme.com team. People from different places were gathered there. They shared their experiences about different pubs, restraunts they visited. Post that meeting, we were served with food and drinks, which was really very good, specially the thin crust pizza (veg and non veg). I did not get time to try any drinks, however I am sure they would have lots to offer. The interiors were nice and gives you a relaxing feeling. Behavior of the staff was good. They asked to serve food or drinks as soon as they saw that there was a requirement for that on your...read more"
1485,"In a nutshell, this is a safe bet. Nice pub, old rock music, really good burgers.Nothing jumped out and screamed to be noticed, but make no mistake.. This is a nice pub... Old wood finish... Nice comfortable booths and a nice outdoor smoking+seating area. "
1486,"We have decided to sit outside as the weather was with us. The outdoor sitting has a huge open oven where they make wood fired pizzas right in front of your eyes, even they make their own burger bun there. Music was very nice and the crowd was decent. Staffs was very nice and polite. They were good in their job. Drink.....On drink 1+1 offer was going on. Tried Jim beam and mojito. Got two Jack Daniels free with their signature burger.Food...Must try their thin crust pizzas. Just awesome.Chatter house non veg platter was really awesome.

1487,"Well, to get a break from the hustle bustle of hkv (though thats my fav place to go) we thought of trying a different place and decided to go Chatter house. The music was good. The quality of food was also not something to complaint about though the quantity was less. We ordered a tandoori n-veg platter and nachos etc. Apart from the quantity everything was good enough to visit the place again. Also, the staff was sweet and welcoming. "
1488,"A great restaurant with wonderful ambience and good food, burgers and stakes are really good and more important is its surely a place which is value for money. The only drawback being the service is really slow"
1489,"Fabulous place,,,¬†nice ambiance...get this place if you want to drink,, best in happy hours,,, 1+1 ... best place in south delhi i guess if you want nice cuisine... best bar ,,, nice ambiance...¬†after happy hours,,, it strikes your pocket ...¬†We ordered 16 pints and 32 came,,,, of magnum,.. awesome,,, ¬†the platter they served was bit expensive but that okay If i get a chiller beer in a very nice place...¬†staff is good and intend to help you out....¬†just awesome,,,, love this place... but before 7:30 it saves your pocket with a big margin....¬†Cheers"
1490,"DAY 14 This place actually takes it name truly very seriously and is actually a Chatterhouse. Their outdoor seating is very good and even the salted groundnuts that they serve. However the seating arrangement outside is a little too closely put and can be difficult to have a smooth movement on the weekends. We visited on a busy evening and despite heavy rush the staff was courteous and the dishes were served on time. We ordered the Chatterhouse Vegetarian Platter, the Very Berry Shake which was drinkable, the Choco and Nut Shake which was good and the Apple and Basil Cooler which was a nice mocktail that they served. If you going for an evening with friends and if you truly want to...read more"
1491,"A very nice warm place to be / hang out wid frnds or partner. Outdoor sitting is nyc and relaxing. On a weekday, music is ok everythng is lazy, the service and attendants and the foods comes out slow. BUT, the food is seriously amazingly tasty. Food makes up for the rating. "
1492,"Its a pretty looking colorful Restaurant and was half occupied when we got there . The place has indoor and outdoor seating area. We decided to sit inside as it was cold outside.The indoors resemble the Irish pubs with classic rock n roll being played in the background. On the entrance billiards and foosball tables are placed. The choice of music has somehow always been to my taste, making the experience good every time. We started off with a couple of pints and chicken Piri piri for starter. The chicken was tender and tasted great. The chicken wings were tender and juicy. The burger was huge with a jumbo patty inside it. But somehow failed to make an impressive mark on us.The staff was...read more"
1493,The place has a warm ambience with dim lighting and comfortable seating. The beverage menu is decently priced and has a lot of options to choose from. It was surprising that they had draught beer on their menu but the not-so-surprising part was that it wasn't available. The place serves Italian food which is very suitable to the Indian palate. For starters ordered for nachos with cheese which had a messy presentation but was good to taste. Tortellini in alfredo sauce was delicious. The server(Shivendra) was attentive and had good knowledge of the menu. Overall had a very good dinner experience. Would love to go back again soon! 
1494,"Thanks to reviews and ratings on zomato to push me to chatter house.......interiors more on the lines of ruby tuesdays, feels very welcoming and upbeat. Outdoor seating is peaceful and beautiful, sets the mood right for a nice meal with drinks.¬†We ordered for:Chatter house veg platter - everything on the platter was cooked perfect and the perfect taste and punch. Really nice and highly recommended.Jacket Potatoes - if you are a potato lover, this is a must try.

1495,"Known for its food and nineties ambience. This place instantly sets your mood and outdoor seating soothes your mind. Checked this place out on a rainy day and loved their outdoor seating . You get all natural green view and rain beautify the place real good. Coming to the food section, i loved their wood-fired oven thin crust pizza (a must try) perfect crust with just amazing cheese and toppings. If you are under 25 you better keep your booze temptations low cos you ain't getting alcohol, and they are strict with the rules. The north indian platter was above average but not wow. All in all this place is a nice hang out spot when with friends.p.s. They have a in-house foosball table. "
1496,"Loved the mocktails here Virgin Mojito - A very refreshing drink, Strawberry & Orange ,But the best was Watermelon Cooler - because of the refreshing color anf taste. Food is amazing from starters to main course. Its a must to visit place. The option of sitting is indoor as well as outdoor which makes it a destination to your mood and weather "
1497,"As soon as you enter the pub is a brick wall which has the logo of Chatter House. I do not know if anyone has observed the logo carefully but there is twig (branch like) coming out from one side which makes the logo look like a chat bubble. The interiors create a magical vintage feeling with posters of old films framed on the brick walls, large screens telecasting sports channel, bar with high stools,¬† an in-house DJ who plays the latest music, old English clocks hanging on the walls, a vintage phone, brick pillars, wooden floor and ceiling. Beautiful chandeliers provide perfect lighting. On one side of the restaurant is a foos-ball table and on the other side there is an open seating...read more"

The place is covered with wooden floor and ceilings which gives it a rustic vintage look. There is even a Foosball table to complete the experience of a Pub.

Special mention needs to be given to the staff, who are very friendly and warm.The place has outdoor sitting as well and one can spot the wood oven where Pizza‚Äôs are made.

1499,Pasta in white sauce was delicious.Good service and decent ambience..Just a bit expensive for a light meal.the chandelier looked beautiful 
1500,Pricing is ok... Ambience is also ok but the food really sucks. The vegetarians will hate this place and even carnis will not like it. Drinks options are plenty and also decently priced. Go if you want hangout with friends for drink only evening... Not recommended for dinner.
1501,"Well I am new to this Zomato thingy!! Me and my gf  looked for couple of places over here to dineout and hangout and we landed over here on the The Chatter House Page. We saw very good reviews so we decided to give it a try. 1st  thing 1st you will be amazed by their ambience.. nice wooden crafted decor.  We ordered couple of cocktails they all were fab. Food were delicious.  Music was nice soothing ""soft rock"". Friendly yet polite staff..  Will definitely be  back for second visit."

1503,Nice cafe with interesting menu items. I have been there couple of times. I love their agi lio olio  pasta. Decent music and staff. If you near nehru place and looking for nice secluded time with your friends or family. This is the place to be.
1504,After reading so many good review about food on zomato planned to go their and unfortunately landed their on valentines day with my girlfriend. place was full and the music was rocking even though we have to wait for 20 mins to get the table ¬†but after having the wonderful experience i think it was worth waiting. the food was good and nicely presented even the surprise was when chef rawat came to our table with complimentary dessert as it was valentine day. Mr Ajay the server was very nice and polite and made our day. well done keep up the go work.
1505,"What a waste of space.. We ordered for Ham and chicken pizza, tandoori non veg platter and Bira beer.. The pizza wasn't warm, and the cheese tasted stale.. The beer was tasting bad for some reason. We had the same beer at the adjacent beer cafe and the taste was much better.. The seekh kabab were pretty hard. The only thing that we liked was the Chicken malai tikka.. Wont recommend this place to anyone specially at the cost that it came."
1506,"I visited the lounge with few friends on the eve of 14th Feb the place was totally occupied by  couples but we managed to find a place in a corner next to the door, it took 30 mins for the staff to acknowledge our presence in-spite of  one us personally mentioning it to the manager that we have been waiting since very long even then nobody turned up for another 20 mins so in total we waited for around 50 minutes  and finally decided to move to some other place. It was a complete waste of time, if the staff was unable to handle the guest they shouldn't have entertained so many people at the same time. It was a horrible experience."
1507,"Lovely place..I especially loved the music,I felt as if they are playing my fav playlist.Ambience is good and service is superb!They changed my platter coz when asked I told that I did not like the taste at all."
1508,"Went to this place for late lunch after searching and reading about this place on Zomato. Foremost feedback was very positive. We ordered the tandoori veg platter, wood fired oven pizza and falafel burger - must say that all of these really tasted nice and the quantity is sumptuous too. Service is pretty prompt - though, I went there during the lunch hour when it's not that crowded. In short, I'll definitely recommend this place. "
1509,Recently visited the place & was impressed with the overall ambience. A great place to hangout with friends!Great Interiors and a very amiable ambience! The food was exceptional; it gave a homely touch to its flavor and moreover the¬†menu has lot of options to choose from!¬†Looking forward to visit again on Valentine Day!
1510,"This is one place which im gonna remember for having ‚Äúkuch nahi‚Äù.The entire Nehru place metro station is an orgy of restaurants ‚Äì food joints and bars trying hard to grab as much attention as one can get. Chatter house was one place which immediately grabbed attention since they played ‚Äúmy kinda music‚Äù ‚Äì retro, groovy and funky (not very commonly heard around the capital city). The decor was well done up like a British pub, with a pool table on the side.The menu had an interesting mix of Indian and international fare. Settled for the BBQ chicken wings and the recommended Chatter house special Bacon wrapped Mac & Cheese bites. Both turned out to be really quite good. The...read more"
1511,"Chatter House, by the name of it, gives the vibe of a cafe. But instead it is more like a Pub, and made in the quintessential Anglican style. Dark tables and chairs, booths, plenty of space. The menu is nicely styled, and even though the beer list is an exaggeration, you can get your brew. We settled for Erdingers and some munchies- Crispy Shrimp Basket and Chicken Nuggets. Since this was an evening catch-up, didn't venture further. Points to note: Happy hour here is 2+1, and till 7-30 pm. There are plenty of screens about too, so will be good for the upcoming sports season (Cricket WC, Champions league etc). "
1512,"Chatter house...nice place for a chatterbox like me...place to go n chillout with friends...  Tried there cajune pizza...it was too good. Also, the goan prawn curry and fish. I liked the place and surely will visit again. "
1513,"Saturday night ¬†at The Chatter House with my friends. We celebrated my best friend birthday party. A complete blissful moment for all of us. One of my friend recommended this place ¬†so ¬†thought I should give it a try. Visited there with very high expectation and was pretty nervous too as ¬†I wanted to make my best friend birthday party memorable. And it completely lived up to my expectation, actually ""above expectation"".. I really liked the ambience, nice wooden interior.

They want to be celebrate my b.day nd it is very good place for me b.day party.music is very good make me happy my feet shaking automatically and atmosphere is awesome  we ordered some cocktails sangria, margarita were  good.Food:- we start from kabab platter was awesome nachoes with chicken a new taste for me. Then we go for main course. We ordered chicken stronganoff  was  amazing, dum aloo kashmiri and keema pao out of mind mean too delicious. Service was just ok. Music collection played by dj was suuuuper.Get back soon"
1515,An ideal place for a hangout with few people. But the service is very poor and slow. Food quality is just okay. The quantity of food served is less according to the price.
1516,"Who went: Two peopleOrder: Peri Peri Chicken with Sun Dried Tomato pesto, Ham and Sausage Pizza and Lemon Cheesecake with Seasonal Fruit SaladExperience: We went here mainly because we needed to eat a quick lunch and get to an event nearby. We placed our order, however, the pizza came before the starters, which was really weird. Anyway, the pizza was below average. The crust and tomato sauce were really nicely done and they didn't scrimp on the cheese either, but the sausage and ham were so tasteless that it ruined the whole pizza for us. The meat wasn't even fried or flavoured, just cut up and put on the pizza. ¬†The Chicken was good - stuffed with olives, chillies and jalapenos, it...read more"
1517,"So, finally I had a chance to visit this amazing place. A fantastic venue for a special occasion I.e. my bday. Extatic with their music, service, courtesy & the most imp. Thing required to make your visit memorable besides the people who accompany you is AMBIENCE. I rate this place 4.5/5 coz I believe their is always room for perfection. Go, visit this place guys!!"
1518,"A pub which feels like one.. a good bar area and ambiance.. Similar to an English pub. Serves variety of Alcohol, the service though can be improved. Tried the grilled Mediterranean vegetables which was not well cooked. The classic burger and chips was good..Good platters and kebabs. The chicken burger though is a treat.The playlist is repetitive.. but features a few good song.As the name suggest, it is one place where you can chat for hours (the music isn't too loud) and enjoy good food ¬†(Do not order vegetables)."
1519,"A great place to chill, relax and have a chat with friends and family. Food is reasonably priced and pretty delicious. Beer buckets are available for beer drinkers, I loved how they used old jars to serve drinks. Very creative. A good place to hang out! Try the cheese and broccoli medallions! Service also commendable. The staff is friendly and helpful."
1520,"At first I was awed by this place, but came to terms with the fact that it is regular food, but decent food nonetheless. Maybe it was just the interiors of the restaurant that made me seem that their food had to be special but after a couple of visits, the charm wore off. I would repeat that the food is decent."
1521,"Stepped in on a Sunday evening to discover copy book pub interiors and predictable play lists. And, then, I ordered, and I had to write this review.¬†This is a gastro bar that truly lives up to its name. The keema paao was by far the best I have had. I was also pleasantly surprised by the way they presented the food. The mutton rogan josh was also pretty good. And, I was told by a reliable birdie that the pizza is also worth a shot.¬†Well, what do you know, Nehru Place is turning out to be quite a place to be!"
1522,Real bad food. Bland and nothing special. A bad idea to go in the day time specially. Had pasta and ravioli. Falafel burger was a little better than the rest of the food ordered. 
1523,"Chatter House is a gem hidden away in the mall/food court at Nehru Place. I have been living nearby for over a year now and have found myself gravitated towards this place almost every time I go out with friends and have some money to spare. :pI've been to Chatter House thrice with different people every time. And every single time, I have won accolades for my choice of restaurant, so I can safely assume everyone who comes here loves this place.The place has nice wooden-themed interiors, just the way I like it, and the service is quick. The outdoor seating is great, with a woodfired oven directly in view and a Lion-mouthed fountain in the wall spouting water (like that famous lion...read more"

But the nachos could have been better. Nachos had a sweet taste duno why. My friends tried butter garlic prawns n they loved it.

1525,"Chatter House is the answer to my quest in unraveling a watering hole in the vicinity. Late bloomer indeed, however, I've been consistently getting hammered here for over a month now. Their watermelon margarita is my favourite thing to drink if I don't have a running nose.  If the latter is the case, they do make mean Winter Toddy. Someone needs to acknowledge their effort in covering the comfy bar shaped hole in my heart. I've mostly gotten pizza to accompany my drinks. However, avoid the vegetarian pizzette platter. If you're a vegetarian, skip the pizza altogether, perhaps. I'm guessing you must have tried better. Occasionally, I've tried the burger (Lucy something)- decent. Mac...read more"
1526,"You get exactly what you expect when you enter the place, namely, good food In a relaxed comfortable setting representative of a classic pub kind of a place. The pricing is also very reasonable especially compared to the size of the meals which they give and the waiting staff is also very well informed and polite. All in all a definite go again place if looking for a relaxed outing  without burning a hole in your pocket and in the process having a good time of it. "

1528,"Chatter House has a convenient location, situated in Epicuria right across Satyam Cineplex. The interiors have the charm of an old English pub and this is where the place wins some points. The food however is a let down. We got the Margarita pizza which arrived in 5 minutes, so I can only be led to believe that these are stored in the frozen section and heated up and served. The flavor was disappointing as well. My friend had the juicy lucy chicken burger which he claimed was just alright. Nothing he would come back for. The service is prompt and the place is clean."
1529,I finally got a chance to visit this place. Easily accessible place as it is right near the metro station. The ambiance of this place says everything about this place. They have two sittings one indoor and another outdoor. Both of them are ¬†quite.They serve you the best burgers :D¬†We ordered 3 burgers all non vegetarian and best one was the naughty lucy burger :D.. People who love cheese would definitely like this burger.
1530,"A nice cosy space with a vibrant ambiance and great music. I tried their herb spiced pizza with a whole wheat base. The pizza was good but I think the taste of the herbs made it a little less salty. The place is lively, the credit goes to the right music played by the DJ there. I had a fulfilling evening and would visit there again."
1531,"So finally got a chance to visit the chatter house over the weekend.The moment I entered the place, I started liking it. It was Saturday so the place was packed and we had to wait for few minutes to get the seat. The food was good, service was swift, staff was courteous, decor was nice and in house dj played some rocking songs to set the mood right. Chatter house lives up to the expectation and its really one of those places that justifies the high zomato ratings. Its a must visit place and I am gonna visit again for sure."
1532,"Went to chatter house for lunch.  The stsff was friendly,  service was quick and food was very good. We ordered spanish croquettes,  kheema pao and grilled veg in pesto sauce and all were good. Kheema pao was excellent. . "
1533,"After hearing a lot about chatter house we decided to visit the place. Located in the epicuria mall just opposite beer cafe is the chatter house. The place reminded me of HIMYM's Mac Larren pub. The similarity was hard to miss. The place has indoor and outdoor seating area. We decided to sit inside as it was cold outside.The indoors resemble the Irish pubs with classic rock n roll being played in the background. On the entrance billiards and foosball tables are placed.

Went to the place along with few friends and occupied outdoors where the calm ambiance is for sure going to attract you .We ordered a pizza and a pasta alongwith few drinks of which the best part was the pizza being baked on the very right side of us as they have the wood-fire oven to serve the purpose . They have a pool table as well which would only be vacant if you find yourself lucky someday . The best time to hit the place would be any rainy day and grab a seat outdoors .

1536,"I visited the place with a friend and was delighted with the decor and ambience of the place. We stumbled upon it when we decided to visit the food mall at Nehru Place (below Metro Station). We ordered Nachos with Cheese and Chicken, Chicken Nuggets and Spaghetti Chicken Red Sauce Pasta. Thoroughly enjoyed the nachos and nuggets but found the pasta to be a tad disappointing. Hot chocolate was delicious. Overall, a satisfying meal and a nice place that definitely deserves a visit by all food lovers!"
1537,Visited with 3 more friends.This place has a great ambience.Lovely music.Nice staff....but but but...not so tasty food.Even drinks taste bad.The open air area is full of smoke.There is a lot of noise all around and the worst part is that it is too costly as compared to the overall experience.
1538,Good food both veg and non veg . Specially veg platters  and pizzas . Overall a nice place to try . Great ambience  and courteous staff . One of the best outlets in this league. 
1539,This place might burn a little hole in your pocket but believe me it's worth it. Super amazing ambience and toothsome food. Loved the mac and cheese! Would love to visit again and again. 
1540,The Jamaican jerk chicken is a must try. The food is very tastyThe ambience is greatThe pricing is really good too I love the aap panna vodka they serve
1541,The place seems to be over rated. The food is below average. The taste is not up-to the liking.The ambiance is good. The service and quality is average.
1542,"Good food, good ambience, pocket friendly. Has a few indoor sports like pool and foosball. Have been here more than a few times, and never disappointed."
1543,What startled me most when I walked in was a family sitting. Never the less food is amazingly good for a retro bar! Ambience is way to dark. Music is fab. Great place to come post work with office guys to unwind. Surely not a date night place! 
1544,"Chatter house has been our regular hangout place for a while now. Their drinks, especially pitchers are worth trying.On our most recent visit, we started with their famous cheesy fries, which were heavenly, layered with cheese, salsa and white sauce.For the main course, we took a Wild Mushroom risotto and a vegetable pizza. The pizza was perfectly crisp, and the risotto was full of flavor. In fact, this was the first time I didn't have to reach for the salt to add to a risotto. This one was well seasoned.With this meal, I took their Apple Rosemary iced tea, which was like summer in a glass. That was a very welcome feeling on such a cold day.Overall, our visit was superb as...read more"
1545,"Nice ambience, perfect for the evening.But got dissapointed with food served.Very bland. No taste.!!Try tiramissu cake.Overall an average place to spend the evening."
1546,"I always wanted to visit this place but end up eating in other food outlets in Nehru place. I finally made it to Chatter house one fine day. we ordered fillet steak and cordon blue chicken burger were decent. Chef Ravinder also very understanding. The menu is very well crafted, Decent ambiance, good music. Great Food .Nice staff. overall great experience.Definitely recommend it.Food= 5/5Service =4/5Music =4.5/5Ambience 5/5"
1547,"A good place to hang out with friends, The food is awesome in a nice Ambience. Service is a bit slow but overall you will like the place. Infact like to visit the place more often."
1548,"I ended up taking a former colleague to Chatter House, Nehru Place as Epicuria was an easy option since he was living in Eros Hotel. I had been to Chatter House once before and was quite happy with the experience and expected the same. Being a Tuesday we got a seat immediately in the patio at the back. Something which I noticed was that the seating was a bit uncomfortable and the area a bit too dark. We ended up ordering the Non Veg Tandoori Platter which was very nice and the meats were moist. We also went for¬† Pigs in a Blanket in Brown Sauce which I had loved on my prior visit but this time the bacon was hard and the dish could be warmer.¬† The worse thing during the evening was...read more"
1549,"One thing which stands out for TCH is amazing service. It's good to see lot of Indian restaurants are making an attempt at it.The outdoor-ish seating is blissful on a cold winter night with a smoke and conversations.It was a short drop by so didn't get a chance to properly try out the food.  Non-veg platter could have more variety. And they didn't have a couple of beers displayed on menu, including Budweiser, in stock. Hence 1-point low rating.Will come back again. Hopefully with more time and bigger appetite."
1550,"Well At last, I started reviewing :) .. 1) Go before 7:30 PM, to get happy hour 1+ 1 offer.2) Ask for Fresh baked Pizza ( You could see them baking pizza, if you are sitting outside, which is at the back of the bar).3) Prices fits your pocket, if you book drinks before 7:30.4) Ambiance is good, food is good, little crowded if you sitting inside. Good outside.5) Best part, they have good offering if you dine there, in 500 you get one bown of chicken/mutton item, one dal makhani and 2 bread. quantity is good for 2 people.6) Pizza is good, mutton kababs, chicken tikka are good.7) If you are asking for any fry item, Say them to make it FRESH, rather then fry it again second time, bcoz...read more"
1551,Average pub grub.. Overall Decent and probably more fun in a large group with a big game on the projection screen. Would I come here again.. Hmmmm.. Maybe not 
1552,Nice Ambience. You come to such places to have a good time. The place is good for chilling with friends . Outside Area is a lot quieter and calm . Food is great. Will definitely try the Pizza next time.
1553,Chatter house is a very nice place to chill with a really good ambience. Its in epucuria. Its a food mall with really good places to eat. Chatter house has got a very pretty outdoor sitting. The food is good. The chicken pasta in white sauce is really good and they have good mocktails. One should definitely try the pizza as well. Its huge in size and for those who love thin crust its heaven. Its about 1500 for 2 people. Nice place 
1554,Everythin about this place is awesum! Good place to hangout on any day and of the week...indian food is also v tasty...pizzas are freshly prepared in brick oven...must visit!
1555,"British pub on a metro station. Could be interesting.Inside it's typical British, gloomy and dark. Choose the seating outside. It's not sunny but the daylight should just do fine.England's national dish Fish and Chips were nowhere close to what they are. I don't know where to put the blame. Am still looking for good chippy in town. Any one?The chicken tikka burger was decent not like smack in the mouth delicious. It is already difficult to go wrong with onion rings, so they were alright.On a bill of 1300 the food was just fine. "
1556,"It's tough to not check out a place with a mini pool table. The crisp fries, the heavy juice dripping burgers and comfortable seating make me want to visit the place again. "
1557,"I went here to catch up with my college friends (kind of re-union) on a Friday evening. Decent ambiance, good music (though the surround system has some problem but we managed with a decent table) with a snooker table and a Foosball table so we did have our share of fun.¬†It is not a WOW or a classy place but yes good deal in terms of prices. The food is also ok but yes the portions are small.A good place in terms of Bar and somewhere we can go on Friday even without decking up much :D :D"
1558,"Ambience: checkFood: checkService: checkValue for money: checkIf you are looking for a great place to celebrate something special, this is the place to be. I loved the place, the setting, the polished ambience, the rustic outdoor seating, and of course, the food. The pork ribs at this place are comparable to what my aunt makes in her kitchen in Shillong, and trust me, she is the best cook for pork dishes in Shillong. If pork is not your meat, go with any other chicken or steak preparation and they are equally good. The only issue I could point out was the laid back attitude of the waiters there. I seemed to have to wave my hand around a little too much to get their attention. Other...read more"
1559,When you are with your loved oneThis place is eccentric !Good playlist is their USP along with try the onion rings and panner burger !Beer is must !
1560,"The name of the restaurant suits this place.The drinks menu is really great,serving one of the best liquors available.The food didn't impress me much.It was not bad but nothing i would miss.Ambience and hospitality was good.You should go here because:1. Serves one of the best liqueurs. 2. The place is new and different.Ps: they also have coffee with absinthe ????"
1561,"Chatter house is the ideal place to go to on a weekend with the crowd occupying all the hubs in Delhi and parking being a nightmare at hauz khas and a problem everywhere else. But going there to park your car would be quite stupid so i prefer to eat aswell. It doesn't give the vibe of place that is serious about food, but the food surprises you pleasantly . I have been through most of the things on the menu and most of them could be had again. The tenderloin burger was especially good(though smaller than expected). One other element that is great is that the music playing is perfect(a personal preference i reckon) to go with the food.The service is decent and the food better than a few...read more"
1562,"Couple of friends, drinks, nice music and a pool table - that's what Chatter House is all about.. Service is good and Staff is one of the coolest I have seen in Delhi NCR.. Pizzas and pasta are must try.. A must go place.."
1563,"My friend and I decided to go out for lunch at some place nearby to our college. So we finalized on The Chatter House located in the Epicura mall.We ordered 2 food items: The Chatter House crispy fried veg platter & the bacon wrapped Mac n cheese bites. We also ordered Choco n nut shake and very Berry shake( both of the shakes were really nice)The first item was new on the menu and was delicious and very filling. The bacon wrapped Mac and cheese bites was a bit bland but the preparation was nice.What shocked us was when my friend found a 'toothpick' in her cheese bite. Luckily, she didn't swallow it and was able to get it out from her mouth.We told the manager about it, who informed...read more"
1564,A good place to hangout with friends although you need to be above 25 to enjoy liquor Good quantity of good with good taste Ambience would be 5 on 5 Back in the 1980's with the retro feeling :)    
1565,Chatter House veg platter was OK !¬†Too much hype created but must say the interiors are good. We even ordered a long island ice tea which was seriously the worst (definitely a wrong choice)Onion rings were amazing and specially the dips served with them were too good !!¬†would like to try some more things next time !!!
1566,"With an absolutely amazing ambiance, good food/drinks and courteous staff, this place stands out in Epicuria.The food is amazing, serving a good portion of each.

1568,"this place was on a wishlist for so long. And this place impressed me more den i even thought off. service appreciated. ambience perfect to sit, chit-chatt and spend some good time. more options fr non-veg, less fr vegees????. i ordered veg platter it was fine not that great and penne mushroom was awesome nd cheesy. overall its a must visit and pocket friendly place."
1569,"This place reminds me of those little bars of 1980s we see in those classic movies. Dim lighting, pictures of famous rock and pop artists hanging on the walls with songs like 1973 playing on the background, makes a perfect ambience for a chilled and relaxed evening with your friends. They have outdoor seating as well which would be very appropriate for the winters.We orderedButter and Garlic Fried Prawns- My love for prawns makes me try the weirdest of combinations with prawns. These grilled prawns, marinated in a tangy lemon sauce blended perfectly well.  The ceasar salad served as a great accompaniment with this.Barbequed Chicken Wings- Smokey flavoured with spicy barbeque sauce is...read more"
1570,"Just a one time visit to this place made me fall in love with it. Just had come to Delhi as a student and the first place I hangout is at THE CHATTER HOUSE. A perfect venue for crazy foodies. Elaborated menu with a handful of choices in anything you wanna try.Ambience of the place is one of the best I have ever witnessed. Music, not so bad when it comes to EDM but all in all it creates a good mood.The main attraction is the projector screen displaying the on going sports matches, which for a student staying in a hostel is a very big deal cuz you know better. :PAll in all the place caught my tounge and I'll surely visit it again to refresh and to eat obvio. :D"
1571,"It was 14th Feb this year, my wife & I were looking for a decent place for a quick grub and some decent drinks to go along. While we went around South Delhi for a while, we could not even find a half decent place as we were quite late. Finally we landed up at Epicuria at the Nehru Place Metro Stn. The food court was immediately ruled out and saw this woody Brit like place on the other corner.Though we were late, we were greeted quite warmly. (Thanks guys for letting us in.) It took us no time to immediately fall in love with the place.¬†Ambience - 4.5/5Very warm, welcoming and clean.

Come here to relive the same decor, level of service, and the simply enjoyable experience of being in a proper pub.Their cocktails and drinks are presented well. The beer is always nice and chilled. Starters need some more work. They need to add more finger foods. Also, every time  prawns are ordered, I found them to be undercooked. Their burgers and pizzas are nice though.Overall, a highly recommended pub in the heart of South Delhi."
1573,"Chatter House in Nehru Place is the best alternative to modern day Hauz Khas village restaurants. The entry to the place is hassle-free and is located in the heart of south delhi. The place offers really nice  in-door and out-door seating options. We chose the out-door seating and the water sprinklers were a delight which kept the torrid delhi weather under check, also its a good option for beautiful delhi winters.So all in all the ambiance is wonderful and has a lot of options to offer.The menu is very well crafted and hits the spot with clear cut offers and suggestions, all of this is backed by really nice food.

1575,"Had an average experience at this place. For a Tuesday night, the place was relatively full. Nice ambiance, good music and a pub like set-up.However, in spite of November about to start, the ac was on full blast and when I asked someone to reduce it cause one of the vents was on full blast directed towards our table, the waiter shook his head and blamed it on centralised air conditioning. Anyway, that's not their fault but it just added to the negativity. So we ordered a non veg platter and a shrimp starter. They were pretty average, the shrimp was fried and tasted average. The platter had this well favoured tikka which I really liked. However, the pita was dry and tasted quite...read more"
1576,"Been to this place a million times. Its one of my favourites. They have the perfect outdoor seating and great music. Have tried almost everything from Fries toMughlai food and it never fails to impress. The veg and non Veg platter are pretty amazing. ( Jacket Potatoes are to die for!)Surprisingly, the Indian platter ( Dal makhani/ Butter chicken and assortment of breads) is also really good and the servings are HUGE. For drinks, their LIITs are super.  Overall, a very pleasant experience and Great value for money! "

1579,"How do pork sausages wrapped in strips of bacon, cooked in barbeque sauce sound? Sinful? Their Pigs in a Blanket is exactly that. I ordered a Cake Martini, attempting to be slightly adventurous with my order. The creamy vanilla-strawberry-vodka concoction that came my way was delightful. The Sangria Rose I had next was steepled just right - a slightly sweetened cocktail of Rose wine, apples, oranges and vodka. Very, very nice. The Tenderloin burger is just... OH. Enough said. Just.. GO."

I finally made it to Chatter house one fine day (office lunch) and it was truly a good time i had with my colleagues. Talking about the ambience it was good,classy look with posters of jim morison and other bands. To try with I ordered one pesto sauce pasta and chatter house special Burger and one mexican sol beer. The best part of this restaurant is that u can try your hand with pool till the time your food is being served.

1581,The Chatter House is everything that a TGIF or Ruby Tuesday are. It's a decent place for a Saturday evening with friends. The cocktails are good and very different but the food is pretty regular. The servers and service are quite efficient. The music of the 90s makes you nostalgic.

Full marks to outdoor decor as it's a car exit lane outside but one doesn't feel like they are on a road :). Food part wasn't that good. Although their Veg platter and Thin crust pizza (Margarita Pizza & Pepperoni Pizza) are good to taste. And yes you can enjoy pizza making in front of you at wood grill."
1585,Had pizza platter.. Best thin crust pizza. Loved it. Great ambience!Specially called the chef and thanked him for the most delightful pizzas.
1586,"Went to this place for the second time, the first time I ordered a non veg platter which was filling and had typical taste. The presentation was great and the staff was really nice. The second time I ordered penne with vodka for which I was first apprehensive about but later loved my decision. The portion was great and the pasta was delicious. The BLT sandwich was great too, however was a little salty. Over all experience was great and the staff is really nice! "

Their decor is terrific - with exposed bricks and quirky posters. It has a very welcoming ambience which transports you to another level.¬†The seating was comfortable - with high stool seating.

1595,Pros1. Ambience2. Great service3. Polite staff4. Customize your dish (talk to the staff before opening the order) - We got an order not as per our expectations. Communicated the same to the manager. The chef came out to get our feedback. Pretty impressive huh ;)Cons1. Quantity for a pasta is average (not filling if you're really hungry)2. Location is not known to many people. It basically is on the basement of the Nehru metro station (hope this helps people who are new to the area)
1596,"An authentic pub experience in Delhi is hard to come by- which is why the Chatter House in Epicuria Food Mall was a delight. There was a slight wait, it being a Friday night but not long enough to encourage us to try our luck elsewhere. They had some great deals on cocktail pitchers and overall their prices were vert reasonable. We ordered a non-vegetarian platter to accompany our order of drinks. The platter consisted of Fried Fish Fingers, Kebabs, Chicken Wings, Chicken Satay and Pita Bread with Hummus- all of which was well prepared and tasty.

Firstly, the place is very crowded during afternoons and you may be offered a place outside, I suggest you wait to get a table inside or go to Flying Saucer next door if you want to sit outside, because the outside seating at Chatter House isn't really upto the mark.

It includes Indian favorites as well as more typical chicken burgers and buffalo burgers.

1602,It was almost full when we reached there on Saturday. The ambience of the place was so sophisticated. I Loved the crowd there. They have a pool table which is good enjoyment while waiting for your food. The best thing about this place is that they give free wifi ????. And then comes the food. It was so delicious. I was very satisfied. 
1603,"The place is great, I really like the booth concept. The food was average, I had ordered a veg platter. They did have pizza platter on their menu but it was unavailble, apparently they were not serving pizzas that day. I had also ordered a white sauce in mushroom which was decent. I feel the place is really nice, with a friendly staff and great ambience , but yes the food could be better for the price they charge."

1606,"This Brit-style gastro pub is a big draw for those Delhiites who love to have some uniquely mixed drinks. What also brings everyone to this attractive little gastro pub is the foosball table that one can see through its bay windows. This little joint is thus a perfect place to sit down, order several of rounds of drinks, play foosball and eat anything from Indian to Italian to American and even finger foods.

We ordered a Non-veg platter which had fish fingers, peri peri Chicken, Chiken salt and pepper, chicken wings, pita bread and hummus. Everything was good, had a distinct taste and was very welll cooked. We'd also ordered a White Sauce pasta which was good too. The manager of the restaurant was very gentle and dint mind to take the order while the other staff members were busy. The restaurant also offers free wifi. We paid Rs 650 for the nonveg platter which was enough for 3 people and Rs 325 for the Pasta. A must visit if planning a hangout with friends"
1610,"This is extremely nice place for casual dine in. Went there with my wife for lunch, the snacks were extremely good, fast service, nice hospitality however they didn't have Hoeggadden (draught/pint) which happens to be my favourite. But its okay, I took other Draught beer. This place gave me feeling of an English pub, though they also serve Indian dishes. The starters like fish fingers & non veg platter are great.... Also in my order, I ordered a veg dish ( which usually I don't) & when it was served I did not like its taste. The waiter himself took it back & didn't charge me as well. I was happy with this friendly gesture. Will surely visit here again. "
1611,Chatter House in nehru place is a nice cool place to hangout. Love their tandoor section in the menu. But the pricing seem to be little high. They serve good food and for that I will be surely visiting them again.

Loved the wooden theme and the pool table. Played pool with beer for such a long time...Staff is although a bit casual in comparison to other similar places. Pizzas were not available when I had gone and also limited beer brands than the ones mentioned in menu.Would surely recommend this place for catching up with friends and for its burgers.
1614,"Good place. Good food.And especially the ambience. The inside seating resembled of the ""How I met your mother"" style ! :D"
1615,"Ambience: Soothing and chill out seating with good music, made me remember the bar scenes from himym!¬†Food: Ordered chatter house non-veg platter which was appealing but came as morsel sized though dazzling.Service: food service is good, staff is caring & positive.Overall: Seating is spacious,food is fine,music is good too,outside seating is really delighful. Cost for two 1700 (with beers)."
1616,"This is a nice place with ambience like a English Pub, woody look, some high bar chairs with green leather seats, English pics etc etc. Dim yellow light. Has few but good collection of chilled beer - has Stella and Hoegaarden draught available in 300/500 ml. Have hardly eaten much here but tried veg nachos, veg burger, hummus with pita bread, onion rings etc. Food is average and do not visit if you do not enjoy your drink. Wine selection is also ok especially Indian. Overall, good place to hangout."
1617,"I was in Nehru place for some work and after that tiring process just wanted to like eat something. My friend suggested let's try The Chatter House since we had heard about it from another friend. Turns out I love the place, super interiors takes you back to a vintage English pub, great food and classic beer! What more can you ask for. We ordered for nachos, the juicy lucy burger and beer. Have to say the good does full justice to the place and their by line ""the gastro pub"" . Must go for a chilled out evening."
1618,"I recently went to the chatter house in Nehru place , just FYI do not visit without reservations on weekends otherwise there is a minimum 20-25 minutes waiting.Very well made and it reminded me of a London pub.I had the Lebanese platter which was okay , the variety of snacks was nice.Go there for the amazing cocktails they offer ! I had the strawberry margarita and the aam pana vodka which was different and had a real tangy kick to it.Overall an average place with good drinks."
1619,"The Chatter House first opened near Epicuria and without a liquor license! Then they got a liquor license and since has been a favorite place for many denizens. Located just near Dunkin Donuts and Beer Cafe in the metro station, they have seemed to entice many a tongues with their American menu. The waiters are smartly dressed and the problem area lies here. They are not on their toes and have to be called atleast 2 to 3 times for a repeat order. I do not know why. If I had approached the Captain and told him about it, I would get a guy to tend to our table instantly but after that it was back to the same story. So service is an issue here. We ordered burgers and pizzas and the kitchen...read more"
1620,"One of the most courteous staff that I have encountered. Last day of the voucher and the Mrs and I trooped in to avail it :DFirst impression. Wide layout gives it a very open feel but leaves you with limited seating. We had to wait a while but the staff offered alternative seating arrangements and we decided to sit on the bar.We ordered the Non veg platter along with the Burger Sliders while in drinks, I had a Birra Moretti while my wife had the Gurkha Godzilla Cocktail which truth be told, was quite quite good with a slight tangy taste and a dried apricot :DNon veg platter had Fried fish strips (brilliant), shish taouk skewer (lovely), Chicken wings (hot),Pita bread with Hummus...read more"
1621,Awesome ambience and cool place to hangout with friends n family. 
1622,Had gone to international trade tower for some office work and was very hunger after the work. So went to epicurA and weighed my options and came up with chatter house.It's was decorated in a britishy manner.Wasting no time ordered the chatterhouse vegetable platter.All contents in it were awesome from the onion rings...stuffed crispy mushroom...potato with feta cheese...to hummus with pita.Then ordered penne in white sauce which was ok though.Overall loved the food and ambience.
1623,"ambience and location - 4/5juicy Lucy burger - 2.5/5The burger itself is filling and is server with fries and hastily done onions. The burger patty was well cooked and was taken off the skillet at just the right time, leaving it juicy.  The bun is run-of-the-mill quality and could have been much much better.  cheese lovers will like it though add there is a lot of cheese between the bun and the chicken patty.chicken stroganoff - 2/5quite bad.  the only saving grace was the well cooked rice. The sauce tasted uncooked and bland. chicken wings 2.5/5decent wings.  nicely cooked with a sweet sauce.  garnished with sesame seeds and green onion."
1624,This place has a nice feel to itself. The staff is good and responsive. Food is good specially for a puby place. The little outdoor seating is my favourite. It's a place you can go to repeatedly for a couple of drinks and a good chat with your friend/colleagues. Ohh and free pool (mini table) and also a projector for match days! 
1625,"A very good place to be at. The staff was courteous, the food was delicious and the ambiance was soothing. Completely seconds its name ""The Chatter House"" atleast for me as I could very comfortable chat along with enjoying the food.Not to forget the food was absolutely inexpensive. In totality, a place that suits your mind, stomach and pocket."
1626,"ChatterHouse has a brilliant ambience with just the right kind of lighting and music and a pool table! However, I wish the same could be said about their food. The pastas are average and the wood oven baked pizzas leave much to be desired. The preparation of the Indian food is better as compared to that of other cuisines. Has the potential of becoming a hotspot, but the quality of their food needs an urgent upgradation. "
1627,"Zomato gifted me voucher for The Chatter House. But somehow we could not go out for dining for a long time now. So taking advantage of holiday today we decided to visit Chatter House and avail of the voucher as the reviews were mostly encouraging. ¬†The location is very convenient of course and we decided to leave our car behind and took the metro and felt good about ourselves.The ambiance quite pleasant - the decor a bit different, good music, pleasant staff.

Blue Angel was good, but amrood chatt was something uncommon and quite refreshing. The crumb...read more"
1628,I have to say I heard a lot of praises about this place and was very keen to visit and try out the food here. So here I come with a friend of mine on a fine early evening. I got seated and the ambience the place offered was excellent.¬†IN COMES THE SPOILER...I proceed to call one of the attendants whom i asked about a tandoori delicacy with all intents to order the same which not only did he tell was not available but also told me that I should know that no place serves tandoori items before 7'o clock and should not have asked for the same from him. My friend and I were really shocked at the discomforting attitude of this attendant and we immediately felt uneasy and checked out of the...read more
1629,"Well Nehru Place is no more just a computer and electronics market but a cool place to hang out after the coming of metro station. Here is Chatter House at the Epicuria, don‚Äôt know the idea behind the name but got a nice ambiance mostly done with wood. Gazing at the wood work and the raised chairs at the bar gives you the feel of some cowboy movies. Coming down to the gastronomy, my pick of the day was Galouti Kebab Platter and Walnut Brownie with Vanilla Ice Cream ‚Äì eastern magic mixing up with wild wild west.

1631,"So I went to the chatter house for the first time yesterday.. And I've got to say.. I never knew there were such good places in Nehru place even though I work there.. So Friday night.. Rush hour.. All you need is a good place.. Good people.. Good music.. Good food and all that at a good price.. Well I'll say you've got your ""Adda"".. Nice interiors.. Excellent hospitality.. Made good friends with the barman palwinder.. Good music was playing throughout the night.. It wasn't so loud that you couldn't listen to people talking.. And neither so low that you missed identifying your favorite track then the DJ played it.. Food seems very good.. We didn't order much to eat.. But whatever...read more"
1632,"On a Saturday lunch, this place was pretty busy with a lot of females enjoying their kitty, teenagers spending some good time and guys enjoing their beer. I somehow didn't like the ambience of the place because i find such interiors a little grim; not their fault ;). The interior is totally like one in an English pub: wooden work on walls n floors, Chester Sofa, tyical Chandliers etc. The food was really good. Burgers are their USP. I loved the Paneer Burger in multigrain bun. It was out of the world. Potatoes with mushrooms were well prepared. This is a pub still the Cold Coffee was outstanding. The service was average. They need to improve upon the service.I enjoyed my lunch and...read more"
1633,"Visited Chatter house early this year.  I possibly am too late for the review. But, very clearly i remember the experience i had then.. A really pleasant one, indeed! We ordered for a veg platter and non-veg platter and onion rings. We were offered the seat outside and a comfortable place to sit and discuss things (considering i was there to discuss my future life plans). We had a comfortable evening though, faced issues with the onion rings. We got our message conveyed to the chef regarding the onion rings and cleared our payment and left the place. To my surprise, i received a call from their chef the very next day about the same. That for me was a delightful service."
1634,Great pizzas. Awesome mojitos. Great time if you sit outdoors. Its a different feel of a classic pub. It is made to waste chattering all your evening. The place for good time!!
1635,"So... We ended up at this place for birthday dinner and yes it reminds me of himym. Ambience great, music good interiors awesome... Ceiling was eye catching. Food amazing, specially chef's recommendation was good. But I definitely take few points back for service which was pathetic, you don't serve food until plates are served on table. Though really liked the attitude of chef, he asked us to cancel our order because white sauce went bad. He attended himself, explaining issue and suggesting the best replacement. Still needs better service."
1636,"It was my first visit at chatter house last Saturday with my family. I have seen best reviews of this restaurant on ""zomato"" that's  why we were came here to try. Restaurant ambiance was nice, but music needs be little slow, AC was not working properly that day.  First we ordered ""Virgin Mojito"" and ""Fresh Lime Soda"" both was good but ""Fresh Lime Soda"" was little sweet. Then we ordered for main course,  We ordered ""Butter Chicken"". It was great ever I had another places. , ""Murg Tikka Masala platter and Bhuna Gosht platter"".

1638,"The Chatter house is an attractive restaurant that really does meet the need of its customers. Its a nice place to have North Indian food, Its ambience and sitting is nice, it is a perfect destination for family dinners, family gatherings. they serve liquor also, which is again a plus point because just north indian food wouldn't give a reason for celebration here..For soup we ordered Chef. Special Veg & Non Veg.Veg,Soup was awesome and Non Veg was equally promising. For starters we ordered barbeque chicken wings and Galouti kebab plater- a perfect preparation, we just loved it! For the main course we ordered Indian delight, Biryani, which was very promising  and butter chicken, basket...read more"
1639,i visited to the chatter house ambiance is so good and the orders bud wiser beer but it was not available then i asked for any domestic beer but i was surprised they do not have any domestic beer or drought beer then we ordered for main court we order charred chicken and jark chicken both dishes are awesome. hopefully we will visit again as soon.
1640,"Heard about this restaurant a lot and so visited this place recently... Ambience was the real attraction but was disappointed with the food... It seemed as I was eating in a normal food joint of the city, food was very oily and tasteless... It was a mere wastage of money ! The restaurant has invested everything in building ambience rather than food and it's taste !"
1641,"Went to this place with my 2 gf's in hope of having a pleasant evening. We ordered cocktails to begin with. I ordered a Cosmo which I thought was a little too sweet. On request, our server made my drink a little stronger. We skipped apetisers and ordered main course. I ordered a 'charred chicken with garlic' and my friend ordered ' jerky chicken'. Both dishes were very disappointing. Our food seemed high on salt content, giving it a peculiar  bitter taste. We left major portions of our food and decided to cut short our dinner. We couldnt help thinking : Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes or maybe we chose the wrong place!"
1642,Me and two of my friends were here yesterday and being a sat night the place was almost full. We waited for 15 minutes for a place to sit and then we were given a lounge kind of sitting for 4 near the DJ console. The ambience of the place is great and reminds you of some Old english Pub. We wanted to have strong beer but it was unavailable so was the draught. We had to compromise with Lager budweiser. We ordered a couple of snacks which were ok. Not so great(tandoori chicken). The nightmare was the AC was not working in the restaurant. We were there for arnd 2 hours and we asked the management 5 times to switch it on but there was hardly any change. Even the manager in a nice suit came...read more
1643,Great place and nice food. Pls note that wood fired pizzas are not served in the afternoon. Also draught beer was not available when we visited.
1644,The chatter house is one of the moat amazing places i have gone to grab a drink with friends. Its pub like ambience gives a feel of Mclarens's bar from HIMYM. To add to it the friendly staff and and the pool table makes it a worthwile to spend your after work fridays here.
1645,"It is themed like an Irish/English pub (on the lines of Baker's St.) with high rise bar stools,  cozy seating booths, pool table and an impressive bar. We ordered charred chicken with garlic and rosemary saut√©ed potatoes and vegetables.  It was served medium rare and cooked to perfection. Next we tried the chatter house non-veg platter which dint fail to impress me either. I found the green apple mojito served in a little jar , charming. Lastly, the staff is affable and prompt in their service."
1646,"Great place. Got somewhat the ambiance of Mcallens (HIMYM) feel. A good outside seating as well. Sweet and polite staff, always welcoming. Pigs in the blanket is a must have for all the pork lovers."
1647,"Chilled out bar with an interesting food menu. Veg tostadas are a must- try among the vegetarian dishes, very similar to a mexican pizza which one doesn't get to eat much in delhi."
1648,"I with friends went there yesterday (28 June) and had a really good time.. Nice food, nice Ambiance, Brazil vs Chile match what more u want..Its situated in Epicuria right below Nehru Place metro Station and has ample parking. Ambiance is like a bar in Landon. We tried Jumbo juicy Lucy chicken burger, Healthy grilled chicken breast burger, Crumb Fried Fish and Chips and Non veg platter. Burgers are good so did fish though portions are small.Service is ok considering the rush couse of match but still I had to go and ask them to provide plates and cutlery to eat, that's when they already served Platter. Otherwise I find staff courteous.They don't have much variety specially in beer's...read more"

1650,Dull ambience and mediocre food. Would not recommend it.
1651,The place has become my favorite.ive made two consecutive weekend visits here and will sure make another soon. The food is delicious. I ordered pizza platter expecting different kinds of slices but instead got 3 small size pizzas and they were a delight for pizza lovers. Veg platter was also very tasty and servings were just right. Service was quick and staff is very polite. We loved playing pool there which is another reason it has become a favorite place to hang out. It doesn't have happy hours that's why ive rated it 3.5 otherwise its actually a 4 rater place going by the food and ambience.
1652,Must visit place. Interior are really good.One can feel more when you are still in formal post your office hours ;)
1653,"Visited the place recently and I was impressed with the place. It gives you the feel of a English Pub. The seating is really comfortable.Food was great, but the best part about the beverages was Cold Coffee. I ordered two, coz I liked it so much. We had the Chatter House Vegetarian Platter, the jacket potato was yummy, and so was onion ring. Though hummus with pita in the platter could have been better. Then e had grilled Mediterranean sandwich which was decent.Platter was really filling. Service at the place was good. There was an option of outside seating also, as it was a hot sunny day we preferred sitting inside. But I would definitely go back and may be in better weather to relax...read more"
1654,"You take Big Chill, add some nice music, some LED TV's along with a big screen, a nice bar and the end result is The Chatter House. Definitely looks like the elder brother of Big Chill.

The ambiance is amazing, has a small pool table, has high stool sitting, has a couch, has bar sitting and outdoor seating as well.The place was packed on a Friday night and it took good 15 minutes to grab just 1 stool at the bar.

Great ambiance, Music was Fabulous, played classics like Ace of Base, Abba !!We ordered Grilled Mediterranean Cheese sandwich (served with yummy crispy fries) and Chicken Stroganoff , both were delicious.

1656,"Great food, good staff and awesome ambience... need I say more. Definitely worth the time and money spent."
1657,The Chatter House has a great ambience and the DJ plays some amazing music covering most genres. Be here if you want to enjoy the FIFA World Cup with the best of the seasoned cocktails and mocktails.
1658,"Been here twice now!My most recent visit was today with two of my friends. The ambience of the place is decent with ample lighting. This place has a mini pool table and a foosball table.Coming to the food. I felt it was value for money. We first ordered cheese nachos. I wish they had chicken and more sour cream as an addition to this.The salsa that was served with the nachos was fresh. Next, we ordered the chatterhouse non veg platter. The fish fingers were the highlight of this platter. Rest everything was decent. The star of the night was the lemon cheesecake. A perfect mix of sweet and tangy.The cheesecake was extremely delicious and creamy.One thing that this place disappointed...read more"
1659,"A new favourite in Delhi. Loved the ambience and the drinks! The food was good too. A couple of things i.e., their sheesh taouk  and the piri piri chicken weren't great. Loved the Jamaican jerk chicken. The mashed potatoes with the bangers and mash were good but the sausages were your regular store bought sausages. Expect better from a place like this. Please do something about your sausages. Rest all was great."
1660,"Nice place with good interiors. The start of a place like this isn't very pleasant though. The pool table doesn't have a cue ball, the Hoegaarden keg was being changed by 13:15, hence were served warm beer!! And THIS I didn't want in 47 degrees.Could do better :)"
1661,Had the best White Sauce Pasta served with Garlic Breadsticks with oregano sprinkled on the dish.

My visit wasn‚Äôt to the Food Court, but to the adjacent Chatter House. The ambience is brilliant, you feel like you are in a classic American Gastro Pub. As you enter a lavish pool table awaits on your left, the place also offers both indoor and outdear seating (weather permitted!).

I had pork ribs, which was being served with warm buttered buns, and they had fungus on it. So, you judge the place, I mean so careless, its sad."

Ordered fried fish and chips , well made and made me regret the red thai curry which was also ordered. Slightly weird it was, it was a combo meal with steamed rice but the helping was smaller than the usual. Next comes the beer, it was almost warm. On asking to exchange them for chilled ones, the manager gave is a blan look and insisted that these were right out from the freezer, they realllly need to work on their service. The garlic bread was served poorly , cut unevenly and became soft after 2min. Not going back again"

But its only happened once... Other than that... The music collection was nothing great.. Too random.... Coming to the Good stuff.. Well it never ends... The food, the ambience, the pool table.... Sadly the fous ball table is gone..... But otherwise everything is ok..... Definately try out the pizza's... Those are the top of the menu..."

The staff is friendly (My friend's phone battery drained but the moment we asked them, they took the phone for charging). We ordered a Chicken Biryani, a Veggie Pizza and Chicken Tikka. The Biryani didn't tasted at all like Biryani due to lack of spice so we sent is back and they very graciously took the food back and brought it with a bunch of spices, didn't taste that well even after (Chicken Biryani isn't recommended).

1672,This place is located in one of the best upcoming food hub of the city- The epicuria  located in the basement of the Nehru place metro station. The ambiance is superb. It has a pool table which gives it a proper pub like look along with the booths. The rates are reasonable compared  to the portion size. The burgers are very good. The staff is also very courteous. Go here at least once!!!
1673,"A great place to hangout with friends !! Great Interiors and a very good ambience ! The food was exceptional , it gave a homely touch to its flavour .. I ordered a burger which tasted gud , n d pizza n pasta were also a treat to have ! :) I loved the way they served their drinks in open glass containers which was very unique .. They have a very friendly staff who were very enthusiastically serving us .. Leavin no empty plate on the table ... Their brownie wid ice cream was just out of the world ... A must have :D they even have a pool table so that u can enjoy while sipping your drinks ;) They only lost out because of their flavour . Spice it up a bit guyzz ! ."
1674,Fusion of American diner and a pub..

1679,Good food and nice place to hangout
1680,"I have been to this place for a couple of times now. It has a western touch to it, with all the wood work, green leather sofas inside, with some rusty chairs outside, this place has space for all. It also has a pool table and a Foosball table, to add to the fun, along with a giant Television. Basically, if you want to go out with friends or want to catch up with someone this is the place to be, with so much going around that you can never get bored.The food. Its fancy by its looks.

The sauce was less salty this time but not too good. I did not want to risk eating it. I paid the bill and left. I spoke with the chef and told him that the chicken was unpalatable, he took it and said that I should come in for a free meal.

1685,"I love this place! I absolutely love this place.From the moment I first entered this place, I liked it. The wood and leather interiors had won me over. The ambiance is just right with a pool table and earlier they had fussball but they let it go in order to increase their seating.

The Aglio Olio was tasteless and very dry. We also ordered the Herb Marinated Vegetable Pizza which was excellent. The crust was thin and crisp and the veges and cheese was balanced.

Decent service and food. I have been there prolly 7-8 times; and for the last 6 times including this friday evening, we had the galouti kebab platter. The dal makhni is decent and the galouti kebabs are quite perfect for when the music is Billboard Top 20.  Total fusion confusion. The chatter house special veg platter, has nothing special. Their mango martini and shots are okay too. They have recently jacked up their prices for hoegaarden on the tap from Re.0.7/ml its gone to almost Re.1/ml. So much disappoint!...read more"
1688,Very good ambience and food but service needs to be pepped up.

Plus , you have the option to add an alcohol beverage for just 99. Thats surely a great thing. Staff is cooperative and service is quick. They have a pool table also incase one might wanna play. Anyways , Music is low and calm and hence a good place to visit and chat !"
1690,What a superb place it is. Went here for a Friend's birthday celebration. The outdoor seating is absolutely fantastic but what takes the cake is their decor. They have a pool table as well and tall chairs and high tables. I love the way this place is done. We had beers and Pigs in a blanket and Potato croquette with Onion rings...and all of it was amazing. They have a wood fired oven and I can't wait to try their pizza. The place is an absolute winner as per me...Love it!
1691,The ambience of this place is gud. Food Menu is limited although service is worst. Take more than half an hour to serve a paneer tikka. Worth a visit for 1 time not more than that.
1692,"The ambience of the place is very old school and has a rustic charm. The service is nice n friendly... The food menu is limited but is surely sufficient. The quantity of food served is just right with a succulent taste, definitely worth a visit...."
1693,"Decent food, ambience, and music. Though they seriously lack speed, the food at times makes up for it. Also, cocktails are a pure gamble."
1694,"Fusion of typical american diner setting and a pub.If you want to try out some American style cuisine and chill out with friends then this is a nice place.There is also an option to sit outside but the diner setting is best enjoyed inside.Try out the different types of burgers,nothing special again but are worth the money.If you want to enjoy a chilled out evening then do visit this place,although it has better places in the surrounding its worth the money."
1695,A great place for a small get together try the open area tandoori pizza is a must have should try mughlai it is the best the place offers this place will make ur taste buds to celebrate from the italian cuisine to the mughlai... must sit in open area Cons- the seats in open area are a bit uncomfortable. Service is an issue. waiters take time to take order but place it at right time
1696,"Second and last visit.Before I come to food I must say the service on the contrary was very good! The moment they came to know we are not liking the food, everyone offered to void the whole bill, but that to me is very unethical since me and my wife consumed food because we were starving.. what's more the manager offered us a free meal for our next visit, and personally took our contact details saying g that the new menu trails are soon going to start. My rating for service has to be 4/5The sausage platter(1/5) tasted very processed.. no flavour, also not tossed with herbs/aromats. Plus the condiments didn't make sense for me. It felt as though they serve store bought sauce :(The...read more"
1697,"Nice woody interiors, good food. Where it gets to me is its good ambiance and decent service. I would've rated better on service but it was a bit flawed. I went there with my friend for the first time. We asked for a table and none was available. I personally asked the attendant to let me know when one is available for us to shift. He didn't. Without even the courtesy of apologizing he blatantly denied it.But still we sat on the bar stools, personally I don't like it, but loved sitting there at chatter house. The bartender was a nice guy. Every drink we got made he made sure that we noticed how he made it. Despite being busy he was good at small talks and the best thing was he asked for...read more"
1698,Great Place .. Awesome Food... extremely friendly staff plus a very good place to eat drink and spend time.. a must go !
1699,"Great ambience but food is not that good,  staff and service is really good..nice place for Drinks though"
1700,This is a fun little place in the epicuria mall at nehru place. The place is cosy and inviting. The free pool table adds to the fun. I have tried the jumbo juicy luicy burger here and the charred chicken.  Both of them were well done and we'll presented. Although they could add some more vegetables along with the charred chicken. Other than that they need a bit of clarity on their menu. The Indian section is just confusing. Also the menu needs a redesign. Currently its a fight to find items in it. Other than its a place worth visiting.
1701,Okay as a place but the service isn't too great. Music was average and could have been much better.
1702,"Finally our 1st visit to the Epicuria Food Mall at Nehru Place and it had to be the much talked new restaurant Chatter House. The interiors were nicely done and gave a shady look. (Had a good pool table also). We ordered the Non Veg Kebab platter, Non veg Wood fried pizza (Spicy chicken tikka plus onion) along with Hummus platter n Fish n Dip. The food was really good esp the kebab platter n pizza. We took a 6 pint booze bucket as well (plus 3-4 loose). The staff was courteous enough to attend  without any delay. The two mock tails we ordered were ordinary types. Overall , a great experience would love to visit again soon.Ambiance: 4/5Food: 4.5/5Service: 4.5/5Cost: 3.5/5Overall: 4.5/5"
1703,"Nice place. It has a warm ambience, great food , a fooseball and pool table on the side was a fun experience.  The staff is very cordial . All together wonderful time."
1704,"After taking on the flying saucer cafe now it was turn for the next line i.e. The chatter house. The wood and the red brick give the feeling of an english pub. It is a nice place to hangout and 'chat' with friends. Also they have a pool and foosball table. The ambience is nice and the brick oven outside for baking pizza's adds to it. We ordered a penne arrabiata, penne with vodka, veg kadai platter and a herb marinated pizza. The pastas were decent nothing great though. The kadai platter was some kind of mix vegetable sabzi which is served with dal makhani and roti. The dal was really nice but didnt like the mix veg. The pizza had a thin crust and tasted well. On the whole we had a nice...read more"
1705,Excellent place to hang out wid frnds for any sports event. The food menu is limited but the ambience and d bar makes ip for it.  Food is nt bad either. But still dere could be more variety.
1706,"Nice Vintage Ambience. Feels like you are sitting in some london bar. When it comes to food dont expect such great taste . I ordered a pizza and a non veg kabab platter , both the dishes were not good in taste. Menu is unreadable , too much made to put on a single page . Ordered a virgin mojito , it tasted average ! Overall , not value for money !"
1707,"Finally planned and decided to catch up and chat with mates & Chatter house was the good choice. The name does justice to what they set out to achieve. It is a typical English pub with wooden floors, old photos on the walls, and a central bar. Amazing outdoor seating. Their menu has so many eating options that it would require me more visits to try other things. They have nice lunch meals and drink pairing. I liked their idea of just adding Rs 49( for a soft drink) or 99( alcoholic drink) to your meal. Its worth the price.Will definitely visit this place again and try there other food on the menu.Cheers!"
1708,"We chattered. We ate.Yesterday I was here for my birthday treat along with 8 people. Its a small place with an ambience like The big chill. The place is cool with an outside seating as well. We all were hungry so jumped to the menu directly. We ordered drinks and mocktails. There were less options in mocktails so we stucked to sunrise smootie only which was a blend of strawberries, bananas and pineapple, it tasted sweet actualy too sweet but manageable. Rest of the crew ordered cosmopolitan, liit, beers of all kind blah- blah. Moving to food, we ordered cheese nachos, golden fried cheese balls, paneer tikka, herb marianated pizza, penne arabiatta, penne alfredo with mushrooms in veg....read more"
1709,"The name ""chatter house"" suits this place as we sat there and chatted for almost 4 hours, we just loved their ambience and food specially 'peri peri chicken with olives n chilis'. If you love to play pool then you surely going to like this place because you can play pool while enjoying food and drinks, which I did. So, it was a very delightful evening spent at chatter house."
1710,"Pearl jam, eddie wedder, wooden interiors, booths , tasty food, reasonable prices, fooseball and amazing ambience. What else does a person wants? Visitng nehru place for the first time at epicuria food hall was definitely a delight coz yayy I found this place. So in love with it. We orderd non veg platter chatter platter which had shish touk, hummus and pita , thai chicken , the bet fish fingers I ever had with dips (salsa too) , this platter was a motley of savouries.  Thr staff was pleasant and the service was rather quick. This place is a perfect place to hang out with friends and relax.along with it we ordered extra hummas and pita which was sufficient for two . The prices were...read more"
1711,"A very reasonable place in an otherwise expensive neighborhood (Fio, Beni##). The steak is good and while its not beef, they do not charge you the moon. I have not been in the evenings but I wonder if the NP crowd will appreciate the food ... maybe that is why its a good idea to couple the bar along with the food ..Keep on Truckin ..."
1712,"I went there for the first time for dinner. The place was lively and alive even on a Tuesday night. The music was good with a nice ambience. We chose to sit outside in the open as the weather was good and the tables were candle-lit. We best part was thedecided to order the Chatter House Platter which turned out to be an excellent choice. It was sufficient for two people (atleast those with an average diet) the best dish on the platter being the shish touk skewers. Overall, a good experience."
1713,"It's always alive! Atleast whenever I've been there. Peppy music, Foosball and pool, big screens on match days, an enthusiastic bartender and good food - Chatter house is definitely a great place to hang out after a tiring day at work. Highly recommend their crazy cocktails - they've created some unusual combinations - aam panna vodka is definitely worth a try. Their chicken mains are spectacular and biryani tastes like biryani should. Sit at the bar if you want the bartender to prepare something quirky for you - they keep experimenting and the results have always been great for me!"
1714,Well the place is an absolute stunner. It is an American cafe with a fine decor. Pool table and foosball table are good add ons. Galouti kebab tastes very good and has right amount of spice to it. Platter is also fine. Aam panna vodka was a bit of a disappointment. Over all it is a good place to hangout but they can extend their menu a bit as it lacked variety.
1715,"So I like easy, chilled out places wit a decent dj and a straightforward menu. I like chatter house. The drinks are priced well..especially their promotional stuff like the margarita Mondays or 150rs per peg vodka Tuesdays and then they have pitchers too for almost everything! They do hoegarden beer by d tap..which is a huuuge plus in my book. Food is regular pub fare and it's pretty decent too. All in all.. I like!!"
1716,"Went there with lady friend for a weekday lunch at THE CHATTER HOUSE.CLASSIC,That is the first word that came to my mind when first i entered in this Iirish sports bar. The staff greeted us with warm smiles and the ambiance too was extremely relaxing . THE CHATTER HOUSE located conveniently at the heart of Nehru place called epicuria food mall , this place really is hard to miss. AMBIANCE wise i must say, from the moment i walked in, The place has a tastefully done with wooden decor and a great outdoor seating with the lovely fresh fragrance of the Wooden Pizza Oven. .they have a very nice american touch to them..There is option of sitting on the couches, high rise stools or at the bar.....read more"
1717,"I visited Chatter House after reading all the nice reviews on Zomato, however, my experience was at the most average. While the ambiance, decor, music was good, the food was not up to the mark!We ordered the pepperoni pizza which had an overload of toppings on it. We also ordered the juicy lucy burger, charred chicken with potatoes and vegetables and veg toastards. All the dishes were very average. The service was not up to mark either. We have to repeated request for a cocktail and starter to be served. The starter was served after the main course dishes."
1718,Went after reading all these wonderful reviews and we were thoroughly disappointed to say the least. The cocktails had no alcohol and my second one came after our main course was over ( I ordered it much before the main course even came to the table). On asking the waiter he said that the cocktail had been made much earlier but he forgot to serve it! The Juicy Lucy chicken burger was very average with bland French fries. The pepperoni pizza had an overdose of sausage on it! Its a shame that a restaurant wouldn't know the difference between pepperoni and sausage. The service was extremely slow and lackadaisical - the starters were served after the main course. I wouldn't to back ever again.
1719,"Nice restaurant. ... , located in much talked abt epicura in nehru place. food is good. Service was up to the mark. I would say it is reasonable than other restaurants for eg flying saucer and fio etc. They do serve liqour on bottle basis as well that too reasonable, which is quite a saving. They have open sitting as well."
1720,"The place scores for its ambiance. Perfectly brought up, it looks like one of those European  Pubs. We ordered Kebab Platter which was quite decent and a Veg salad which was superb. Good place to just sit back, relax and catch up a good match on TV. Worth visiting."
1721,What a place... Great food.. Chilled beer.. And amazing ambience. Must go place with Friend or in a group
1722,The places is good if you are going with a bunch of friends..The drinks served here is good.. I could feel the effects of the Long Island Iced Tea. All in all a funky place..
1723,"Let me go one by one for this one.Location : Perfect! Located just below nehru place metro station, could easily be approached by metro and ample parking too. Epicuria mall is fabulously planned and is beautiful. One should visit the place, could be for beer or good food. It probably has got all the outlets.Ambiance : Lovely! It is a typical English pub with wooden floors, old photos on the walls, and a central bar. Amazing outdoor seating, perfect for feb and march.

1726,The purpose of my visit was to catch up and chat with a friend & Chatter house was the apt choice. The name does justice to what they set out to achieve!The atmosphere of the place is relaxed and comfortable. Ambience is reminiscent of a british pub. Pool table & foos ball table are good additions for people who want to do something apart from chatting. The posters on brick walls is the typical norm which has become bery common these days but still looks good. The al fresco area too is nice. Seating is nice(bar stools mostly) & We took the booth table.Menu: The menu is quite extensive and lots of cuisines are available(even Indian main course platters).

I dont think I would change anything at all. Foosball table, mini pool table,classic rock...everything is very neatly done. Music does not hinder your conversations rather it compliments the latter.Food: I believe we ordered all the starters-both veg and non veg. Platters,galouti kebabs,burra kebabs,french fries,nachos to name a few. Perhaps the best nachos I've ever had though I'm not a real fan of it. The platters and kebabs were very well cooked.

Was excited when I saw Hoegaarden draught on the menu but was just disappointed when they said no draught beer. 2 guys walked in after us and were served Corona, when asked the server he says he didn't know Corona was available. We ordered Chatter House special French fries with salsa sauce and melted cheese and we got was a bowl of fries topped with salsa sauce and cheese so there was nothing special about it.

But, he's sitting all hail and hearty attending a never-ending lecture....so that says a lot about The Chatter House.we had ordered chicken nuggets which was good except for the quantity, the mustard-honey sauce provided with it added the zing the dish required.Next came the lemonade and again i felt the quantity was questionable...my sunrise smoothie was filling and tasty without...read more"

Minestrone soup-delicious and a good portionChatter platter veg-amazing paneer tikka, wonderful pita hummus, crispy stuffed mushroom were a little bland, onion rings-soggy and oily, baked potato-delicious. New york style cheesecake-just perfect. Few negatives-slow service and most drinks not available. Coffee was brought from Dunkin Donuts. But i will definitely visit again as the food is great and staff polite and warm."

1738,"The moment I entered Chatter House there was a warm welcome, reminded me, of my holidays in Singapore. The place has mixed feeling of being in a sports bar and Irish bar. The music is usually pop and with excellent ambience, having seating options outside and indoors. Outside the set up makes you feel very relaxed and add to a cottage feel. The paintings around is vibrant and Chandelier with crystals makes the place bright and royal.Food is superbly priced, along with options of chef specialist.

Well, we started with the Fish Tikka which was quite good. We also ordered some french fries which could've been thicker and jucier. Ordered a veggie pizza as well for my 2-and-half-year-old which was almost the pick of our order. A portion of their sliders came next which I liked (meat in buns..tho slightly dry..but not complaining too much).     What was the worse were the Boti Kebabs.

Even thought it took around 15 minutes for the food to come, it was delicious none the less.

True to the reviews it has got so far, it was a great experience dining here. The place was packed with Sunday merrymakers but we got a table all right. The warm, cozy English-pub like setting of the place drew us in immediately. I ordered a green apple-rosemary iced tea that came with slices of fresh green apple...so refreshing!

So, after a lot of thought, we ended up ordering, charred chicken with saut√©ed rosemary potato and grilled vegetables and ‚Äòpizette‚Äô platter and coke.Food was good"
1747,"Came here for dinner on a Sunday night with family. the place is done up very well with comfortable booths. There is a foozball table and a mini billiards table on one side as well. Incidentally, there was a Manchester United vs Chelsea match that day, so there was a big screen and the atmosphere was great. One of the members in our group had a concern with garlic and the chef was very cooperative about that. He took the time to visit us and let us sample some sauces to make sure they were fine. Much appreciated. The non veg kebab platter and vegetarian pizza were quite nice. Vegetarian pasta was also good. Would definitely come back here for the atmosphere and service!"
1748,"So the name is a bit Odd, but the place is great! The Ambiance is quite nice... and we placed ourselves outside near the lovely fresh fragrance of the Wooden Pizza Oven. The service was pleasant but a bit slow, they were aware of the menu which is always a great thing! Now we ordered the Juicy Lucy and the Marinated Lamb Burgers... and was very happy with the taste and size of the patty...Just right! ... Now on the other hand, the cold slaw and potato wedges were stale. All in all this place is a place to have a great time with close pals, hidden away from the busy/crowded metro station/Satyam theatre/Nehru Place!!"

No one, except the exceptionally soft of head, turns up in a pub to dance or listen to loud remix music but Chatter-House seems to think that this is par for the course in a fine dining establishment!

1764,"Good American Food, Ambiance gives you a feeling of sitting in  an american restaurant. Burgers and there breakfast platter is just awesome. Grilled chicken and charcoal pizza's are just finger licking, time of serving is slow but after having food one can neglect it. A pool table and big screen for entertainment is something which keep's you attached to this place for a while. Will definitely visit this place again and try there other food on the menu."
1765,"A nice place to catch up with friends.The food experience was a little mixed one. The bun masala omlete was unique and tasted very good. But, the dissapointment was the ""P B and J sandwich"", it had no PB, I would have been able to make a better fried (as written on the menu, but all I got was a 'grilled') sandwich. The drinks menu is innovative and the price is also reasonable! The margarita pitcher and bubblegum martini was the star of the table. Outside sitting has availability of smoke and with such comfortable and cozy ambience, this place is what I would suggest for a chill out station near the nehru place area.Approx Rs 900 per person and soo many things to offer! Go...read more"
1766,"I love how Delhi restaurants are focusing on themes, ambience and on the overall experience along with good quality of food and service. Chatter House is one such place in Epicuria which has some nice looking restaurants. We decided to come here for it's Irish pub feel with a proper bar front, pool, foosball, outdoor seating, booths and high tables. The ambience is tastefully done and the whole place has a very warm and cosy feeling about it with small chandeliers and yellow lighting which is perfect for Delhi winters. The outdoor seating is well lit as well.This place is a must go if you're looking for an authentic bar feel. They also have TVs so you can catch up on the latest in...read more"
1767,"Its a nice comfy place to spend cold winter evenings with friends and beer. The Pitchers are worth the money although at first it may seem a little pricy. We had the nachos and strawberry Margaritas. The nachos were nice, cheesy, ample in quantity and fullfilled the expectation of being awesome nachos and not some overpriced doritos with a dip on the side.The margaritas had a good alcohol content that packed a punch which was just right. It was overpowering and neither did it taste like a mocktail, it fit the palate right.Their outside seating is nice, tiny cozy with little lanterns and candles in them, just perfect for a winter dusk.The seating inside is like a nice friendly...read more"
1768,An awesome place....specially the outside seating arrangement...very much apt for winters.......very good food.......substantially large portion size........extremely warm and hospitable staff......a complete thumbs up for this place......waiting eagerly for the bar license....would definitely love to go again.....and suggest the place to friends.......
1769,"The Chatter House takes you a few steps back in time and lets you absorb and contemplate the concept of a pub set across the Victorian & Edwardian era; one with elaborate interiors and ornate finishing. It seems that the concept examines the changing attitudes of today‚Äôs society and weave them into the old fabric, to create a place that reflects grandeur set against an urbanized backdrop in its design, planning, food choices (the menu is very interesting with popular dishes across the globe) & music (fabulous rock from the 60s, 70s & 80s). With incredible food, remarkable service, beautiful ambiance, soulful music & a terrific concept; The Chatter House is certainly the city's best...read more"
1770,Superb. Great food at low prices with foosball and snooker
1771,"We went there on a Saturday evening. The ambiance of the place was good. It has a pub like feel but the music was not too loud and we could have a conversation in a normal tone. They have a pool table and a Foosball table also and a big screen. The menu has a mix of Indian platters as well as pizza and pasta fare along with a good variety of starters. Its a good option for a group where people might have different choices of cuisines. They also have good platter combinations along with the option of adding a beverage to the meal at a nominal price.However, the food was not great. Wouldn't in anyway say it was bad but very ordinary taste. We ordered a galouti kebab which was not soft and...read more"
1772,"Epicuria food mall is the new thing in town with a number of restaurants and cafes and among one of them was this amazingly done American themed place- The Chatter House.We entered the place around 2:00 pm. Probably because the place is quite new, not many tables were occupied. The weather was pleasant, so we decided to try the outdoor setup. The outdoors is very nicely done- there is a lion head fountain just opposite the entrance door and a brick fired oven on the left where you can actually see the chef make pizza. Towards the right, is the seating area with metal garden chairs and slabs with cushions placed atop making it the perfect place to hang out with friends.But...read more"
1773,"The Look and feel of this place motivated me to try this place and the ambience of this place rocks and so does the food quality.With it being located in the Food Court next to the Metro station, its so easy to reach there... will surely be coming there again sometime soon...."
1774,A value for money restaurant! good food and ambiance with a good playlist of songs!... presentation is also decent... but it is not very exclusive!
1775,Great ambience. New place yet to get their bar license but must have their guava mocktail. I had a steak which was done just right. The wood fire pizzzas are to die for !Once the alcohol get flowing this will truly be a slice of Ireland back on Delhi. Try to open seating option during the winters.
1776,Amazing place.. With great outdoor seating.. A must visit if you are looking for something different.. Not very expensive.. And their butter chicken is a must try ..
1777,"Great ambience, good place to hang out, but their food is not so good. The description of cheesecake on their menu looked really tempting, and was a complete disappointment. It was stale and tasted quite bad. The french toast(apologize for the error of stating waffle) on the other hand, was quite soft and fulfilling. They did not have alcohol at the time of our visit, currently having their license renewed. I hope the quality of their food and service improves after their new license comes in."
1778,Chatter House is located right beneath the Nehru Place metro station at the Epicuria Food Mall which makes it a convenient location if you travel via metro.  The Chatter House has a nice ambience and the interior decorations match the style.I ordered a Greek Salad and Vegetarian Platter for starters. The Greek Salad was amazing but I would have loved some more feta cheese. The vegetarian platter was good too with multiple options on the plate. It is pretty decent to share between 2 people. I went for a traditional main course and ordered a Mutton Biryani. The Biryani was slightly better than average particularly because it didn't have enough meat and it didn't taste like a traditional...read more
1779,amazing food and humble staff!!
1780,"I love their English decorum, and not the least- everyone should try the steak there- though I feel the mashed potato is decorated with much garlic!!!!."
1781,"Most authentic pizza's I've ever had in Delhi, strongly recommend. Nice ambience and cheerful staff!"
