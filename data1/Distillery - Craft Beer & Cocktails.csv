Thanks to team distillery for wonderful evening . Especially thanks to Nitin and Sanju!! üôèüôèCheers!!!!!"
2,"It was amazing ambiance, staff was very good delicious and fresh food , and good quality of food thank you"
3,My first time here and it was one of the my best experiences .the ambiance is vibrant and soothing as well. Various types of setting arrangements are there. You can also sit on terrace and enjoy the view .crowd is also good.the staff was courteous and was asking explaining all the dishes when asked. The food was delicious and quantity was also satisfied. My all over experience was great. Definitely I will visit again this place. 
4,"It was awesome experience, amezing ambiance, delicious food, staff courtesy polite and professional,Thank u guys for make my evening such a wonderful... Cheers ü•Ç"
5,"Hello Peasants,This is the grandest place you can find in the Sector 29, and apart from the ambiance everything else is grand too.So next time you think of visiting London, New York, Singapore, even for work, just ditch them n visit this place instead. It'll give you the better feel about life."
6,Ihad an amazing party experience at this place though I lost my wallet but the party was LIIT. Starters with drinks were tasty.
7,"Great food and drinks, chakhna platter is a must try. Nice ambience and courteous staff."
8,"The service of this place is really slow but the staff is prompt. The upper management is slacky in their operations. They rarely solve your problems and barely listens to you at times. One can understand it's because of a large amount of people but why are you there for then? Food at this place is great if we have to mention, I think it's a bit expensive as compared to the amount they serve. Staff again is really courteous and respectful, go here with a group of friends and ask them to accommodate you to a private room on the terrace, it's worth it!"
9,"I went there one a Saturday night. Food was good. A happening place for food , fun and dance. "
10,"Few months back i visited to this restaurant for checking some delicious food and i found correct place. I tried pakoda chat, gangster pakoda chaat, and really love this. Tatse was amazing. In main course I tried Chicken lababdar combo and it was enough for two people and was tasty. "
11,"Was look for a place to hangout w/ my friends and this was one place which had been on my list for some time. The property is situated at the very entrance of the sec-29 market road so this was a major plus or me.Upon entering the property there was a rustic vibe and the place is humongous divided into 2 floors. We chose to sat by the window. To drink i had a Red Wine Sangria and to eat we had quite a few things namely the gangster kulcha Schezwan Chicken Dimsum, 4 Cheese Tortellini w/ Spicy Tomato Chutney.The food tasted just too good w/ flavors right on point and every thing was so balanced.Shall try other things next time."
12,"Visited this place a couple of weeks before and i loved this place. The property is huge and i mean it. we sat by the window overlooking the whole gurgaon suburbs.We started with LIIT and then on to some daiquiri. To eat we were suggested Pakora Chaat w/ Chutney foam, Naked Chicken Dimsum, Chicken Ghee Roast Kulchaand i absolutely loved each of them. Especially the Ghee Roast Kulcha was just üíØ.Im so glad this was the last place i visited before the outbreak. Shall visit again and try other things."
13,"One of the finest places in sector 29 Gurgaon offering unmatched services. The rooftop seating area is best and adds to the overall ambience. I ordered Veg Spring rolls, Veg Pizza, Honey Chilly Potatoes, Wok Chaap, Chilly Paneer, Chicken Seekh Kabab, Chicken Strips, Chicken Dumplings and some drinks.Chilly Paneer and Honey Chilly potatoes were quite similar but I loved having the Spring Rolls and Veg Pizza.Overall the food was delicious and I can visit this place again to relish the amazing food. Recommendation: Veg Spring Rolls, Chicken Seekh Kabab and Veg Pizza.Food: 5/5. Ambience: 5/5. Service: 4/5."
14,This time we have went at distillery at guru gram.... The ambience was awesome and the food Presentation was well and we all have ate so much.... It deserves more than 5 stars... Really it was an awesome experience there..
15,We have eated chicken wings american cocktail and the best their chicken murgh was the bestest thing and their staaf was friendly and i loved this outlet ‚ù§Ô∏è
16,"I was simply amaze with its marvellous look. Distillery- crafts beer & cocktails is one  of the amazing property in Gurgaon. It's two floors and rooftops seating which turns out to be quite spacious. Coming to food, multiple cuisine is quite a thing here and taste is awesome. They do fusion and experiment with tastes. Brewery is also brilliant here which attracts many. Overall finest place to visit and spend quality time."
17,"I visited to this place with two of my place. We absolutely loved the place as its gorgeous. Good music and great food added to our overall experience. We had some mocktails- Coco bango- coconut milk and pineapple tastes great. Apple sin- lime soda, cinnamon syrup apple. juice and fresh ginger combined together tastes so refreshing. Beer was great as it brewery. Food: Aglio olio in olive oil tastes divine, paneer spring roll was so crispy outside and creamy inside, Dimsums are quite a thing. Medu veda onion rings with Chutneys is so good. Excellent place and good service !!"
18,Distillery is quite popular place in Gurgaon. Its spark being crafted beer brewery and multiple cuisines. They have very interesting presentations as well. I love the fact how they do contemporary presentation of the simple Indian dishes like dahi bhalla named as curry. The service is also commendable as the staff is so friendly and attentive. Love this place for serving luxury and serving finest.
19,"We had a corporate party of about 20 people on Wednesday and the place has a very good ambience with a great DJ and not to miss the wonderful food.The manager (Ketan) helped with getting us the appropriate place within the bar which was secluded from other people and was more of a personalised experience for us.Would recommend ""Distillery"" to all Corporates for arranging a great party and a good get together, Cheers and looking forward to more fun at this place üôÇüëç"
20,"It was a great experience. Attended corporate party and guys let me tell you, nowhere in NCR you will get such a wonderful service. Staff and manager are very helpful and they know how to treat a guest. Very prompt in service specially manager (ketan). This place can surely make your eve special. Must visit."
21,This is really a blunder of a place. The blaring sounds at intense volumes made the music sound very unpleasing and distorted. The ambience is good but the food and service is way below par. Not a good experience at all.
22,"I went to this place for a corporate party but my experience was not good.The starters were not served hot. We requested DJ to play bollywood songs so many times, but he refused each time and played it after 8:30 pm, though there were only 3-4 tables booked on that day. The staff was not courteous and overall it was a bad experience."
23,"The staff cleared the table while we were at the dance floor, without even informing us. Manager (Ketan) was really rude when we told him serve the dishes since there were people who hadn't eaten. Overall, a pathetic experience."
24,whatever we ordered was served with so much delay n they are not even bothered abt it. Something like beer was served 40 mins after ordering. Even if u ignore that this is a highly unsafe place to be at with a bunch of goons serving u. Also the timings mentioned are not followed. Their unruly and unethical staff start forcing and misbehaving with the whole crowd to vacate the place by 12 when they mention timings as 1am on apps. For this they hav kept a bunch of gundas who threaten and even push ppl like how. Beware of this filthy and terrorising adda. Rest we all are educated n sane unlike them. Cheers ü•Ç
25,"This was the second time I visited the place for an office party, has an amazing ambience but the service is pathetic. Would like to highlight a few points:1. Staff served me beer, when asked for pina colada 2. The dance floor was super sticky3. Starters were served after an hour of starting the party4. Alcohol was served for just 1.5 hours5. Main course was cleared off without even informing 6. When asked to serve a plate of main course, the manager, Ketan was adamant and rude. He was unaware of the timings the serving started and constantly argued, without checking it with his staff. He sort off spoiled the entire experience for me. It‚Äôs just the ambience and music that is...read more"
26,"The staff was totally unsupportive and rude... Even the manager (Ketan) was so unprofessional. Went for a corporate party and all they were concerned about was the payment.1. The snacks were not served on time and everytime we had to ask for that2. The staff were refusing to serve the drinks even when they were in the deal3. They cleared the table without asking anybody and when asked to serve atleast one plate, they refused and argued with usHighly unprofessional, rude, and arrogant. There are way more better places to go in Sector 29 than this place. Spoiled everybody's mood. Even 1 star is too much for them!!!"
27,"Went there for a corporate parry, the food was not served at the appropriate time, so when i asked to provide the food when it was actually required, the manager refused. Really bad experience."
28,"The ambience of the place is breathtaking, especially the city's view from the roof top sitting area.A nice and cozy place to visit ."
29,The ambiance here was just amazing. I loved every bit of the decor. The food was pretty good and the presentation adds to it! Would love to spend my weekends over there.
30,"I havee been here a million times but this place surprise you for good. I hosted my birthday party and all I knew was that I'd keep coming back to this place for life. From a great service, great food, ambience this is the place you would want to chill at while looking for a great evening or night out. Also, ask for Sumit if you are looking for incredible service. Boy! Was he amazing? Yes! We all had the best time here."
31,went to this place and had a amazing experience over there. seating ¬†is very comfortable. it also a having a terrace seating which gives a beautiful view. talking about food . it was very tasty. a worthy place with food and cocktails. they maintain a very luxurious interiors. a courteous staff to serve every customer.
32,Superb service and amazing food! We went on a weekend afternoon and were truly overjoyed with the service and ambience of this place. Chef santoo was presenting best food to us and we were too happy with their services!Tried many small plates-Mango dahi wada chaat - served in a small plate with liquid nitrogen on the side which was so well presented.Onion rings- Served in a tree like with rings hanging around.Mushroom kulchas - Mushrooms grated and filled in small kulchas served with mango chutney.Naked Chicken momos- Served with 3 chutneys called as naked because no maida covering was present.Coral paneer pakoras- Called as coral because of there shapes. It was so crispy on...read more
33,Good ambience perfect place to relax
34,Quality gone down. Fresh beer has become shit. Wheat beer not available. Other beers not available. Servers getting white wine instead of red wine. Average food. Avoid!
35,"It's a huge property with their very own brewery and an exquisite menu that would sweep you off your feet!The food here is just to die for! ~ I absolutely loved the presentation of their food. It was vibrant, colorful and just so eye-pleasing. The pakoda chaat looked beautiful as ever and was a treat to my taste buds. Kohlapuri Chicken tacos were yet another amazing starter! ~ And the meal was capped off by a sensational dessert, International Halwai which had layers of chocolate mousse and what not! On top of it was poured a rasmalai syrup which balanced the sweetness of the layers! SO PRETTY!"
36,"Distillery resonates the prohibition era but with a hint of adventure and modernism, making the blacks even blacker, the fires smokier, the liquor stronger and the women prettier. The bar is all set to take you back to the golden ers of gramophones, cigars, and gangsters. A bar that never goes out of liquor and a dance floor that‚Äôs never out of RAD music, this place is the party hub for millennials. Borrowed from the styles and textures of the popular era and fusing them ‚Äòto match today‚Äôs taste, Distillery is a handmade hybrid of the old and new. This one has the biggest terrace and is touted to be the largest bar in Gurgaon, located right at the entrance of the market. They have...read more"
37,"Perfect in everything. I went there with a friend of mine, i think late of december. It was in my mind to write a feedback but completely forgot about it. So here goes, absolutely perfect on the view, hyped crowd, excellent food like Chicken kolivada. Superb. Just keep up the good work. We had drinks which were perfect"

Food(especially chicken) was absolutely lip smacking.Ordered quite a few things-Chicken taco- these were my fav. With green base and creamy stuffing...this made my day Chicken keema kulcha- this was the show stopper....i ordered it twice and still wasn't able to get over it.Desserts were also good and virgin mojito was very refreshing
40,"What to say about this place. I had an amazing evening with my friends here. I loved each and every single second spent here. With a very luxury vibe to the authenticity of the food, i was completely mesmerised with this place. The staff was also interactive and very cooperative.We ordered-Chicken keema kulcha- No doubt, stole the show. I could have eaten it for like multiple times and highly recommend this dish.Chicken taco- these were also amazing. With a green base and amazing chicken filling, i enjoyed this dishChicken dimsums- got that authentic taste which i was looking for. Must tryVirgin mojito- very refreshing"

42,"DISTILLERY in Sector-29, Gurugram has a prompt service with some authentic flavours. The ambience is good with spacious two-floor seatings and a beautiful roof top. Enjoyed the Asian cuisine and the service by special chef attendant ‚ÄúShantanu‚Äù. Starters especially Kolhapuri Chicken Taco, Chicken strips with barbeque sauce and Gangster Chicken Kulcha served with Makhani and Tamarind sauces were unbelievably tasty. Other items like Pakodha Chaat, Shanghai & Naked Chicken Dimsums, Murghi in trouble and Chicken Tikka Pizza were also good.Lastly, ‚ÄúInternational Halwai‚Äù in Dessert is highly recommended which is made of Kalakand, Nutella And Vanilla Cheese cake served with unsweetened...read more"
43,"Distillery, a new craft beer and cocktails destination in sec 29 Gurugram.The ambience is so beautiful. They have rooftop seatings as well.We started withGangster Pakoda ChatKohlapuri Chicken TacosMurgi in TroubleNaked chicken and Pan seared spicy dimsum.All were very unique in taste. I love the Kohlapuri Chicken Tacos, it was scrumptious and had amazing presentation.In desert -We had tried International Halwai it was amazing.Overall had a great experience.Highly Recommended."
44,They sell beer expiring the next day and refuse to change even on pointing it out saying we opened cap now and you better payup. Would never recommend this place to anyone. The red label ordered also tasted a bit iffy. Shady place i must say for selling substandard liquier at premium prices.A place with craft beer in its name i expected some craft beer on menu but no fresh beer and zero craft beer on menu as well. Named just to lure people inside as its a tiring walk anyway till the 5th floor.
45,best delivery outlet. they provided the fastest delivery services. Distillery is one of the most amazing places in Gurgaon sector 29.This place has very appealing ambience and quite fast service.
46,Its a horrible went to the place for the first time. The services are pathetic.. u order something and wait for half an hour or more.. ull not be served .. not even with drinks.. never wud reccomend
47,Ordered drink and service staff from past 40 mins giving excuses sir just 2 min and by the time i am posting this review drink is yet to arrive ü§£
48,Visited this awesome me place with a couple of my friends. Refreshing cocktails and delicious food spread. Stuck to not trying anything new and tried the best and conventional food combination. Phirni was the best
49,"This has been one ofour favourite places to have some good foid and share a refreshing cocktail with friends.Ambience is absolutely beautiful and the place is well maintained.Drinks are refreshing a nd one must try Thunder Bolt LIIT.Also , food is just great. Go for Chicken Kulcha and butter chicken mac and cheeseIn Desserts , simply have 999.9 fine gold brick and you'll be satisfied.Enjoyed a lot and would love to visit this place again."
50,"The food quality varies between different items. Some taste good but some are sadly average. However, when I pointed out the taste the waiter was helpful and sent the cook to have a word. Once I informed him about the overuse of a particular ingredient he rectified it and made it better."
51,On Sunday we went to distillery along with my friends our server was pravnjan he was really wonder full and help full person food was also really good and amazing with chef's garnishing pravnjan suggested us paneer bhurji cigar roll and crispy cheese corals both were amazing and tasty we ordered mango raspberry slush it was also unic and presentation with eadable flower we will visit again soon pravnjan did good job keep it up. ...
52,"An amazing bar cum casual dining restaurant which I accidentally explored in sector 29. It has got 3 floors of space with amazing ambience. The rooftop is quite spacious which gives a view of the gurgaon skyline. They have a good cocktail menu. We really enjoyed the red wine sangria. In food, we had medu vada onion rings which was amazing. Service is quick and staff is warm. It also has some space near tables to groove on nice mix of English and bollywood numbers. Overall a great place to enjoy your evening."
53,"Distillery is an excellent place to visit if you're in Sector 29, Gurgaon. This place has great ambience and roof top seating as well. I tried Medu Vada Onion Rings, Kolhapuri Chicken Taco, and Cottage Cheese Steak. And in desserts, I tried 999.9 Fine Gold Brick and Liquid Chocolate Muffin. Everything was delicious and if you're a Non-Vegetarian, this place is a must go."
54,"Distillery is a very lavish outlet for a nice evening with friends or family. They have nice range of cocktails and LIITs. We loved the tropical LIIT. The chef presented us with their signature dishes. Medu vada onion rings, butter chicken mac n cheese, paneer tikka pizza and much more. Their signature dessert gold plated cheesecake is one of the best desserts you'll have."
55,"I totally loved this place. It was my first visit here. The staff is so helpful. Their steward Prabanjal, was so cooperative and helped us a lot with food and drinks. Indeed a wonderful experience. Good looking food with very good taste. Also, the owner treated us with warm hospitality."

57,Distillery has very appealing ambience and quite fast service. An amazing place to hang out. Mocktails and cocktails were amazing.Food is also really best.The best part were the deserts. The place had an amazing variety of deserts.Would love to visit again.
58,"One of my favorite places in Gurgoan to party. Everything here is great, from food to drinks to ambience. If you are a mutton lover, definitely try the - ""get my joint"". The drinks are remarkable especially the LIIT's as they have four different flavors in it, my favorite - Exotic Island (its berry based). The service is very quick and the staff is very friendly and accommodating.¬†#a must try"
59,"We went here for a b'day party, our order was all vegetarian, drinks were pretty strong which is bit rare in lounges now a days. The problem was the portion size and taste of food. It was not sufficient as per the price and taste was average. Vibes are good of this place but that's it."
60,"Loved the ambience of the place, the rooftop is absolutely lovely. The drinks were also amazing, pasta and pizza were equally good. Apart from this we took mafia mutton chaap, though it was a bit disappointing in taste. But overall, had a lovely experience In terms of money: 4/5Taste wise 5/5"
61,"Loved the presentation and d taste of the food was awesome! As soon as we entered the terrace we were in love with d place especially on a sunny winter afternoon-just perfect and we thought if the food is going to be good here then we‚Äôll be fan of this place n we were not disappointed at all.....loved d food, ambience n d service!"
62,"Distillery is one of the finest place to spend time with some good food and an amazing view from top. You can see entire skyline from the terrace dining over there. We went in evening time and we really liked the ambience from terrace rather than indoor sitting. We ordered some Sangria, the red one was perfect but white one had some over ripened apples which had really bad smell so we complained and they changed the drink, well thats part of good service. We ordered butter chicken mac n cheese and Murgi in trouble. I must say butter chicken mac n cheese really stole our heart. That was perfect. Rest overall a good place to have some good time and good dine."
63,Good food. Nice ambience. Courteous staff.
64,Horrible Ambience. Horrible Service.
65,"Distillery is a recent addition to the chain of restaurants in sec29 which offers amazing delicacies along with great service making your dine in worthwhile.We started with,Kolhapuri tacos and mushroom filling which were great and delicious.I then had paneer cheese crackers and daal makhani along with kulchas which were perfectly prepared and taste absolutely scrumptious.In desserts, I had internation halwai which was nutella filled ball served with rasmalai syrup, though this could have been a bit better but we really liked the whole experience."
66,"Went to this place and had an amazing experience over there. This is one of the happening place in sec 29. Talking about seating, its very comfortable. Its also having a terrace which gives a beautiful view. Talking about food, it was very tasty. We ordered garlic bread, chicken dimsums and baked chicken which were amazing. My overall dining experience was ultimate"
67,Amazing place and people there would request for feedback on the food. Mutton Chap is a must try in non-veg starters. Though it take a little longer sometimes to get your order but the ambience and music will keep you engaged.
68,"In this blog post, I cover Distillery, a new Craft Beer and Cocktails destination in Sector 29, Gurugram.Ever been to a themed, multistoried restaurant that takes you back in time? A visit to the all-new Distillery will remind you of the Prohibition - an era spanning between 1920 to 1933, which gave America its gangsters, peddlers, and speakeasies. A cultural reprisal of that era would've been a tall order for any restaurateur, not if you're Sahil Sambhi and Manish Sharma. Distillery is yet another winner from the family of Molecule, The Drunken Botanist, and Viet:Nom. Throwing caution to the wind, Distillery brings you the biggest terrace and the largest bar in Gurgaon with unabashed...read more"
69,"I visited this place last week to celebrate new year and and it was definitely worth it. The ambience and interiors of this place are beautiful.I ordered the Pakoda chaat, kolhapuri tacos & dimsum. All were very unique in taste; I love the Gangster pakoda chaat; it was scrumptious and had brilliant presentation.In main course I tried Chicken lababdar combo; it was enough for two people and was tasty.Overall, the presentation, food and service all were best. I will definitely visit again."

I tried multiple dishes out of which my favorite are chicken and mushroom kulchas served with makhani gravy, kolhapuri chicken tacos, pakoda chaat and dimsums. In dessert, International halwai is a must try.Serive was really prompt. Would definitely recommend this place."
71,"Distillery is a newly opened place which is located in the market of sector 29, gurugram. It is spread in three floors and having a beautiful ambiance. This place is also having rooftop seating. If you want to have food with a view then this place is a must tryy. Talking about food, it was so good. We had mango yogurt chaat which tasted amazing. We also had lahori chicken tikka, non veg gangster kulcha, chicken in trouble. The food was perfectly cooked. I must say thanks to the chef who made our visit memorable. At last we tried their all time favorite dessert named chocolate muffin which is a sweet end.One can have amazing experience over there."
72,"Visited this place with friends to have lunch. We were so impressed by their warm and rustic ambiance. The outlet is very spacious and have a rooftop seating with a city view. We tried many items from their menu. The Ganster pakoda chaat, which was so well prepared and presented.The kohlapuri tacos and dimsums were also super scrumptious.Their ganster kulchas are must try items, had a chicken and mushroom filling and was served with dal makhni and a makhani gravy.In desserts, we had white brownie which was so soft and gold brick cheesecake which was something unique yet luscious.I also recommend their Sangria and few mocktails were good, too. Overall, we are completely satisfied with...read more"
73,"Words are absolutely least to express the joy that I had, visiting here. Talking about the food.... I loved to have mango chaat (kind of street food) absolutely amazing and watered mouth with its heavenly colours and aroma. Chef special Non Veg Dimsums are drooling and one can easily devour them all at once. In drinks I would surely recommend LIIT and the freshly prepared Red Sangria with a perfect blend of fruits that defines the beauty of horticulture üòçüëåAmritsari Naan with Dal Makhani & Butter Chicken are undoubtedly scrumptious and worth it. .How to Reach?Not a hectic task at all, Nearest metro station is Iffco Chowk and an auto can ride you at the outlet within 5...read more"

In main course thai style chicken and dal makhni with butter naan which was really amazing in taste. Really loved the food from here.Plan to visit soon this place.Loved it to the core.The food was fresh and healthy...It was delicious
77,"Distillery is no doubt the best and the most spacious place in sector 29. It has 3 floors of sitting area... It's hard to choose where to sit as every floor has its own beauty. They have done a phenomenal job in designing the ambiance. Talking about the food I would recommend to go with their chef special menu. Special shout-out to Chef Santu...he has magic in his hands..as the food was so amazing.Service was really good, staff was super friendly.Love this place!!!"
78,"This place is one of the best in the whole Delhi Ncr. Really good ambience, tasty food items which are presented in a very beautiful way and great service from staff. They have rooftop too which has bar also. It is amazing.."
79,They kicked us out at 12am saying that they're closing even though the closing time is 1am. But just because the bar was empty so they said there's no point if keeping it open. They literally gave our drinks in a disposable glass and asked us to leave! It's not our problem there's no one in your restaurant. It was just so insulting. We gave 3k for getting kicked out at 12:15 and had to drink outside from a disposable glass. I would like to speak to the owner. You need to teach your staff how to behave else close your restaurant please.
80,"Sector 29 has got plethora of restaurants but Distillery definitely stands out with it's fantastic food and drinks menu. Ambience is inspired by the end of prohibition era. Shanghai style crisp fish is an absolute delight. It has got perfect balance of flavours. Chelo kebab with kuboos is highly recommended. Cocktail menu is really interesting interesting with a bunch of out of the box concoctions. American Dream, a whiskey based cocktail with Indian spices and bitters is mind blowing. Coco Bango is a great mocktail. Don't forget to try out the special 999.9 fine gold brick (that's edible!). Whenever in doubt, just ask the helpful staff here for recommendations and you won‚Äôt be...read more"
81,"Absolutely love this place. It is huge, beautiful, classy and fun. The food menu is elaborate and the staff is courteous."
82,"Distillery is an absolutely amazing place. Ambience of the place is lively and the place is pretty spacious. The bar is stunning.Everything from something as simple as a Manchow soup to a chelo kebab, an Iranian delicacy is done with perfection here. Plating is done in a very pretty manner which just adds to the whole experience of eating. Would definitely recommend Chelo kebabs which kuboos. The kebab is very flavourful and it just melts in mouth, goes really well with kuboos. Cajun spiced chicken Wings which are baked to perfection were also delicious. Cucumber surprise is a really refreshing mocktail.Service was really prompt. Do visit distillery for a wholesome dining experience."
83,"An excellent Place in Sec 29 to enjoy fresh brewed beer and Yummy food. The food is a pleasure to see and an amazing concoction of traditional and modern gastronomy. Great emphasis has been laid to the flavours and presentation and equally commendable is the service. The place is huge and.cam cater to large group for a relaxed hip hop evening over chilled beer and lip smacking snacks. I tried numerous things but loved the tandoori jhinga, butter garlic prawns and the twisted version of dahi Kein sholey. The drinks menu.covers numerous traditional and modern infusions along with equally good mocktails for the non alcoholics. The deserts at the place are totally unique really loved the one...read more"
84,"Worst every experience,  After spending 20 minutes and asking to be seated was made to run up and down by their manager and finally one said to give him couple of minutes to find a seat but even after 10 minutes they refused bluntly.. All this happened after booking confirmed via Zomato"
85,Must try it
86,"Chef's special Liquid chocolate muffin set my standard of making and presenting the food to a cery good level. Kohlapuri chicken tacos was itself one of the best fusion category of food I have ever imagined and tasted as well.

The decor gives it a rustic classic theme which gives it in turn a very lavish look.

159,"I believe that connecting with people over food is an extremely underrated ritual. It is very commoditised and run-of-the-mill and while several eateries are trying to experiment with the experiences they can offer to the patrons, not all are really able to maintain fun element intact while remaining classy as well. .Distillery is definitely is right up there. It is classy, vintage, transports to the setting of sensational 20s and still manages to preserve it‚Äôs flavors beautifully. Thanks to few reccos, we could all come together and spend an afternoon amidst this array of colorful (and delicious as heavens) food and drinks that tasted so surreal that I had to ask for their mix every...read more"
160,"So they have opened recently around 1 month ago and there are a lot of improvements needed, the staff needed to be trained more precisely although our experience was quite good and the rooftop ambience was best and full of energy. We ordered their wheat beer that tasted good but it didn‚Äôt have that kick we all expect from a good bear apart from that Jalandhari Paneer Tikka which was good in taste and Cheese Totellini was superb. Overall it was nice experience, would love to visit them again üëçüèº"

And I personally lived crispy corns with roasted peanuts and spinach, best sides üß°The staff is very courteous. üåº"
166,"Visited this amazingly new place opened in Sector 29, Gurgaon.With a 2+2 on drinks offer from Zomato the place offers really great music, multiple storey sitting, roof top deck and some amazing lighting all over the place.Surely a perfect place for any office parties, date nights, friends outing, client meetings or any family get togethers.

168, Ambience was nice. Terrace is great food was okay in taste. Incomplete beer stock. Not all beers were available. Manager was rude in behaviour. 
169,"Here is the reality - The music here sucks! They did such a great job at the ambience and interiors, but I wish the owner could keep it classy. Like most other places in sector 29, it is loud with poor music choices. Go there only when there is soft live music. We went up to the terrace and even there the speakers were blasting the loud music. It killed the mood and excitement.Drinks - The brewery is yet not open. So no fresh beers. They have interesting menu of cocktails. They decided to remake all the classics with their own desi version, by adding mint and masala. I asked for a regular Moscow Mule, they refused to serve that. Do you not have skilled bartenders to pour a nice mule?Food...read more"
170,"They refused to give us a table even when they accepted the Zomato gold unlock...They were extremely Rude on our face..In my opinion , they should be off the Zomato Gold privilege"
171,"Lit was horrible, food's taste and quantity was pathetic. Bad experience .. Ambience was awesome. Music is good. "

173,"Newest kid on the block, Distillery undoubtedly stands tall among the rest of it's counterparts, for it offers ambience, quality and service, all together. Versatile nibbles and heady cocktails combined with great music, all in all, a perfect party place or a great weekend venue be this"
174,"#FoodReviewByShradha#Distillery#GurgaonIn a place like sector 29 where we have multiple options to choose from , the very thought of opening a new place would definitely would not have been easy. It would have taken a lot of planning and homework to ensure that the concept is unique and it should attract the right set of people. While we have quite some established brands already in sector -29 , a new place like Distillery is definitely a class apart. With the kind of experience we had there , it is the best example one can set for Ambience, food , music, theme and hospitality.The food was free flowing and not even for a second gave this feeling that it is getting made in bulk....read more"

177,"Vegetarians Beware!!!I'd recently visited this place along with a group of 15 people. Most of us were vegetarians, hence, we'd specifically told the waiter that we'd be ordering only veg dishes. Despite that, a non-veg dish was served to us, and upon seeking confirmation, the waiter said that the dish was veg. But it was non veg and after calling the chef, he didn't accept his mistake completely. This was unacceptable. Being a new restaurant, I had great expectations but now I am very sure that me and my friends would never be visiting this restaurant again."
178,When new York got burned it taste yum and when a leader like prashant is there u don't need to worry about anything.... He will bring wht u want and even get what u think of.... Well deserving. Mr. Prashant all the best for ur future
179,I sat on rooftop. The view is beautiful and well maintained infrastructure. The food(4/5) was good (because 1 of the item we ordered was (0/5)). Music was light at rooftop and good at 4th and 5th floor. Overall experience (4/5).
180,"It is true that good food can only be prepared when chef has put his heart and soul into it same goes for chef shantu who is great at his work super confident and will leave u surprised with his creation. Wonderful evening spent at distellery, amazing chef and his mouth watering food,highly recommended to go and try his specials."

183,"We have visited this place today and highly disappointed with the service . We have asked for pint beer and they served it the beer at room temperature. First turn off for the place , which recently opened and do not have chilled beer at all . After that we ordered food (chakhna platter ) in which they have served local namkeens with no preparation. Big no to this place . "

190,I got to know about this place from social media platform as they did a lot of promotion for their opening and their launch party on 7th Sept. I visited this new place on friday night with my friends. The place is huge as it has 3 floors including terrace. No one helped us to give a better place to sit but we somehow we chose to sit on the first floor. While ordering we asked for the in-house freshly brewed beer the server said it will take a weeks time to start. Then we asked for the domestic beer in the menu then the server said we have just opened the place today so we don‚Äôt have anything except Kingfisher Premium.
