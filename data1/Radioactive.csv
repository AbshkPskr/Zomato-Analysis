Everything was nice in terms of taste and quantity.There was a billing error, luckily I spotted it.But special mention for our server who was trying hard despite all the goof ups and also for the valet as he was one of the most professional one I have seen."
1,"A Small Place but the atmosphere is LIT , located on main club road in Punjabi Bagh the place is good for hookas and munchies along with drink. The food is decent and the cocktails/mocktails worth try. The Menu cover Indian, Chinese Italian dishes. The pizza is quite good worth the try. Overall nice place to chill."
2,"Radioactive is a very pretty place to take your partner.It has a very pretty terrace.I went out with my friend and I loved the decor.Totally an insta worthy place.Coming to the food I ordered tax max fries, pizza and mixed sauce pasta.The food was decent.A decent place to go in punjabi bagh."
3,"Radioactive has a cute little space at terrace.It has also a lounge part as well.You can enjoy both the lounge vibe and the pretty cafe vibe aswell.I went out with my friend and The mocktails were bartender special and totally loved it.I loved it pasta, it was saucy and tasty.Tax max fries were too chilly, definitely a try.And pizza was not that good.But a good place to go."

6,"So , I was just craving to have some good food after lockdown and RADIOACTIVE became that place for me.Visited here last weekend and was quite excited to try my favourite food .we had pav bhaji , paneer tikka , Spring rolls and cold coffee . Personally in my opinion cold coffee and pav bhaji were perfect .Also the cafe is taking proper precautions like every waiter is wearing mask plus proper sanitization ."
7,"This is a perfect place, be it your special date night or dine-in with family. Lightings are great, specially at the roof top. And food was great too.We tried cheesey burritos, spring rolls and both were great. Watermelon mojito and virgin mojito were absolutely refreshing.Loved it."
8,Radioactive was a nice casual dining place with great ambiance. It had an indoor seating as well as roof-top seating. I loved tandoori momos and soya malai tikka.Oreo shake and strawberry shake were true bliss.We also tried penne Alfredo and enjoyed every bite of it.I truly recommend this place.
9,"Dine in to this place for lunch today with friends. Good cozy place with cool glimpses lighting, initially food was served indoor but later on moved to Roof top which was so beautiful , Full of greeny batch which was so catchy. Food was good too my take was pepperoni pizza along with Burrito for starter served with Mango Mojito. But I preferred more of main course which was served amazingly. The take was Cooker meat which perfectly balanced with all masala. More over a good pocket friendly place to be with close ones"
10,Recently visited this place with my friends over lunch. Their main floor was fully booked so we had a spot on the rooftop. The Ambience is pretty decent and the staff served us really well. Even with that crowd we still got our food right on time and there was no delay or complaints. The food was very delicious and the quantity was great as well. Totally worth my money & time. 
11,"I in the last week went to this spot which has launched  its outlet in Punjabi Bagh Club Road Market which is a center point for all F&Bs. I went here with not many of my companions for an easygoing excursion and out of shock this spot is astounding as they serve delicious food in moderate costs. The outlet has very comfortable seatings and the staff is all around prepared and humble in their administration. They have a wide assortment of dishes going from North Indian to chinese and some more! This spot is must attempt in case you're in or around Punjabi Bagh . Approaching the food, we attempted their Veg Pizza, Paneer Tikka and Pav Bhaaji which were quite good in taste. Stew...read more"
