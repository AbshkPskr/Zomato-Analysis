0,"First of all it is located at Andaz, Delhi. I personally like the staff and obviously the ambience. Buffet system is also available there and you can enjoy variour variety of dimsums. "
1,Awesome place and Staff was extremely helpful & suggested us various choices of food & drinks according to our liking. Staff really made us feel at home & took excellent care. The music was very nice & even the ambience was fabulous. The is really good and tasty
2,"Good looking hotel, modern and pleasant at first look, attracting the local trendy youth from medium/upper class.However, this clientele tend to behave in a rude manner, helped with the concept of the hotel which is too friendly and too much braking the codes. Example: there is no check-in counter per say, it's a group of 3 islands. very well thought, very friendly, totally not formal and putting you at ease. But, each and every time you're busy with the attendant, somebody has to act as if they didn't see you and come on the side to cut on you, as if nothing! And this is because the islands can be access from sides.The staff of the restaurant is rude and always trying to make a...read more"

5,"If you are looking for a laidback Sunday brunch that puts flavor first, head towards the Hong Kong Club at Andaz, Aerocity.The Brunch menu is set to become a haven for food lovers. Already a favorite hangout for people who love authentic Chinese cuisine, here you can savor a delicious spread of appetizers and main course all washed down with their signature cocktails, mocktails and sangrias. Make sure to join them for the Sunday brunch that will be accompanied by a soundtrack of smooth live music. Brunch here is a truly luxurious affair. We loved gorging on the sinful dimsums while sipping sangria and whiskey sour. The dimsums were all was so well cooked and incredibly indulgent.The...read more"
6,The ambience is cultured but the music is aimed at a younger club crowd... the two don’t really match and creates a rather jarring experience. The food is good but not as good as it costs.
7,A beautiful place with amazing ambience and amazing bartender ..manoj made our night enjoyable and lovingly... Thanks for the great service...amazing food. Our experience was superb
8,"Extremely slow service, it's so bad that I almost felt like leaving the table in between the service. There was only one lady taking orders, clearing the table, getting food and almost other things too. I felt sorry for her. It's so difficult to believe that it's a part of Hyatt group."
9,"Very nice location with awesome barkeeper, especially Mr. Manoj is a very smart, friendly and helpful person with a very special acknowledge in his job. recommend place or high quality Cantonese cuisine in the Delhi."
10,Terrible service!!! They took what was supposed to be a memorable wedding anniversary dinner & turned it into a really bad experience. We had to wait over 45min for every course. Wrong orders being delivered at our table to waiters not paying any attention to us to giving us the bill when we asked for the dessert menu. I can’t believe that a hotel like Andaz has a restaurant with such poor service. I’m really sorry I decided to book this place for dinner on my wedding anniversary night.
11,"Very nice and classy restaurant in aerocity. Obviously except the prices as per its standards, but very good food, tasty and amazing quality. You can go for a nice evening and good classy food. I had pizza and salad. It was tasty."
12,"If you like a high-class experience in New Delhi, That's the place to go to. The food and environment are exceptional. The food was really awesome and tasty. The staff is very helpful and they really know what to recommend."
13,"Best Place to be....Recently visited with my friends. Must say this is the perfect place in NCR. Starting from ambience,food and staff everything is commendable"
14,"Classy place , great ambience , good foodand a fun place to hang out with friends . However the DJ the weekend we were there was atrocious , no beat no tempo down right atrocious . Her music ensured the place drained out by 1 am on a saturday night"
15,"I've visited Hong Kong Club which is dubbed party central post- midnight; it's 'the' place to be in terms of ambience, cocktails and trippy music by International DJs! But last fortnight it was the first time I was indulging in the Cantonese cuisine it's celebrated for. Trust me, the menu doesn't come close to describing the intensity of the flavours that await!Walking in from the poolside entrance, my friends and I were once again awed with the sheer scale of its spaces—the two-floor three-hundred cover, artistic restaurant and lounge has a central island bar, private dining rooms with their own bars, open kitchens and wine racks. My friends and I surrendered ourselves to the...read more"
16,"Very large place , got very good music , has a large spread of food as well. Located inside the aerocity , has very good crowds .. The live music and dj both are equally good . Quite a large menu for drinks as well . They practically have everything .quite a lot of space , smoking zones and open till the wee hours for clubbing afficiaionados .. hope the service could be bit better .."
17,"If you are looking for a classy place to party then your search ends here !!!Fantastic service, good food & some great wines to enjoy with amazing music 🎵 Worth visiting once for sure & yes there sunday brunch is the best deal of town!"
18,Completely overhyped place the extent that nourishment is considered...staff is incredibly friendly.The lotus stem with potatoes and fresh onions were stunning. The bacon-wrapped prawn sui mai are absolute necessities as well. The fundamental course absolute necessities are the chow-mein and sautéed greens. Completing with their fantastic pastry platter.
19,Went here for the Sunday dimsum and champagne brunch and had such a wonderful time. Choose from a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dimsums. The lotus stem with potatoes and crispy onions were amazing. The bacon-wrapped prawn sui mai are must-haves too. The main course must-haves are the chow-mein and stir fried greens. Finishing with their excellent dessert platter. Pair the afternoon with champaign and live tunes!
20,Absolutely overhyped place as far as food is considered...staff is extremely friendly but despite changing our dishes thrice the food remained extremely pedestrian.Kindly review your rating system Zomato.
21,Pathetic food irresponsible staff never to visit again. I had to cal for my food 10 times. Despite being empty i had to wait 1 hour for food.
22,"visited the place some days ago with corporate colleagues. amazing place with  beautiful interiors , great food and lovely cocktails. they also have very good collection of wines. we tried one Australian wine ,which  complimented the food beautifully. we ordered some  'Vegetarian Crystal Dimsum' , 'Crystal Prawn Dimsum',  'Crispy Pork Belly' and  'Barbecued Pork Bao', all the dishes were very well made and well presented. service is a bit slow and there is scope for improvement. overall a amazing place and highly recommended."
23,"Good food,Staff is very attentive:)Thankyou:)"
24,I recently visited this place and ambience is great !! This place is cool for team events.!! Food here is not that great but staff is very courteous !Overall good experience!!
25,I had a great time here!! We had three dumplings and three customised mocktails. The service could have been better. But the girl who took my order for customised mocktail was amazing. She was really nice n humble to understand and pay attention to the details. She even came and asked me if I liked my drink or not. She can change if I am not liking it.I wish I could have asked her name to mention here. But she was really amazing. And coming to the drinks and food. Everything tasted really good. 
26,"Hong Kong Club - Stylishly Luxurious....Located in one of my favorite hotels in Delhi/NCR, The Hong Kong Club was on my list of restaurants to visit since a very long time. I finally did get the chance and the experience was rejuvenating. After having visited hundreds of restaurants in the city, this super stylish and posh property had me impressed and thoroughly delighted, a combination of feelings that is not all that common.The 'Sunday Brunch Menu' had a lavish combination of Dimsum and Appetizers and we carefully chose what we felt would thrill us. Accompanied by a glass of Champagne, the Brunch session was ready to take off.From the 'Vegetarian Crystal Dimsum' to the 'Crystal...read more"
27,"THC , at Andaz is magnanimous. Great water body welcomes you , high ceilings , amazingly beautiful bar , sad thing is they had only Bira and Edinger weiss beer. Their lotus stem deep fired with steamed potato was just ok. Steam dishes were good. However being a Sunday there was hardly any crowd. Aerocity is buzzing now with many watering holes. "
28,"I went for Sunday Brunch at The Hong Kong Club. Absolutely loved the brunch menu, the number of dishes offered for brunch are good. You will get a variety a variety of veggies, chicken and seafood. To add on Top unlimited champagne, perfect Sunday brunch in the town."

30,"Formal, great ambience and good music !The interiors are beautiful to be out for special occasions and dates. The sitting is well managed and quite spacious. I love the feel of this elegant and classy place. This makes it expensive than any other pan Asian restaurant in the city.The drink menu is limited but good choices especially their wine collection is a delight.Talking about the food. Again it’s limited in choices but it’s got good recipes which is well suited to an Indian taste.I have always loved Asian and Cantonese food for their subtle yet delectable flavours. And if you do so, you should visit it and anytime is good :)"
31,"Must try: Pork Shumai, curry bean bao, pork belly in kasundi, wok fried rice, tossed chicken.DecorAndaz Hyatt is a upscale quirky place. There are motifs present that make you believe it's a wonderland. So when i was invited to experience the Sunday Brunch at their Hongkong Club, my initial assumption was it's just another club. However walking in, it looks like smart casual dining, where fine dining meets a club. There's a band performing live and mixologist creating alchemy with edible flowers and jasmine tea. While you might think that's pretty regular, unless you pay a visit you wont be able to fathom how it feels.Special classAs a part of promotion, you can now experience a...read more"

33,"Located in Andaz Aerocity, The Hong Kong Club is a multi-level entertainment dining destination that offers a bar, restaurant and lounge with a modern Cantonese menu and large repertoire of beverages.The interior of this place is a masterpiece of modern architecture with Chinese influence. The architectural beauty of this place is a thing to be seen by eyes, not one to be described in words. It is a seemless match between class and comfort. Live music added another charm to this place.The staff is courteous and the service is neither fast nor slow.I went here for the Sunday brunch.

35,"Hong Kong club is one of its kind club, located in the magnificent Andaz hotel. The restaurant is beautiful, in terms of decor, the huge bar in the middle, and the comfortable yet classic sitting space.The Hong Kong club serves authentic cantonese cuisine, which I really enjoyed, the food is prepared fresh by the Cantonese chefs, in fact all the dips are also house made.For starters, I can recommend you to have chicken wontons, and the corn cake having a really soft texture, the chilly dip compliments it quite well.For mains, I had kung pao chicken and noodles, which were spicy, and chicken nicely tossed in the kung pao sauce and cashews was just amazing.The service was great...read more"
36,It’s a beautifully place. The food was good. No doubt . What let’s one down is the music. It’s 1 o clock and the music still hasn’t picked up. It’s vague and frankly doesn’t live up to the hype of the reviews. The food is good. Desserts are great . But music - indecipherable! If you want to come to this place for music - forget is . DCG and Social are fat better !!! 
37,The place was very disappointing and doesn't live up to the hype. The manager was extremely rude and the food was average. You can find better places nearby. 
38,"Firang masquerading as a dj. Why would a club with great interiors need to stoop so low?! N pray why is the crappy music so loud for a lounge bar?! Can turn it down a notch there peeps! And further more, overpriced drinks that don't quite do much for the palate.Room for a lot of improvement"
39,"This place is perfect for a date night! With friendly staff, lip smacking drinks, great music - surprise your loved one by booking a table here! Although there are not many option is vegetarians here!"
40,"I visited this place with my friends and it was amazing.Totally mesmerized with the ambience and the interiors of this place.The Hong Kong club has a concept of fine dining with the club. Where in you can enjoy your food and can dance and listen to live bands, music and enjoy with your friends all at one place.Coming to food they have different chefs for different type of cooking.One for steam food,One for wok,One for barbeque,One for desserts.The chefs from all around the world comes together to make a memorable meal.We we had -Prawn dimsums - perfectly steamed dimsums with cooked prawn inside.

Dont go here expecting Indian Chinese dishes like manchurian, chili potatoes..this place celebrates Cantonese cuisine which focuses on celebrating natural flavors.. fantastic! The ambience with the live music is amazing and highly recommend this place especially for special occasions!"

44,"The place is awesome. No doubt about that. The staff is very courteous and attentive. But... The vibe is missing.It has been done up beautifully, however the buzz is missing. The bartender cooked up awesome cocktails. Definitely worth a try"
45,The place was okay. It was a bit shady. The staff didn't really know much about the club. Specially the manager. Didn't really tell me much about the offers or happy hours.
46,Love the ambience and music especially on weekends. The staff is friendly and professional. Plus the place is open till 4 am so great place to unwind.
47,"Location 5/5Ambiance 5/5Service 5/5Food 5/5Vibe 5/5I think this really sums up my review of The Hong Kong Club.So we reached Delhi around 11:00 PM, we were staying in Aerocity itself. So asked around and apparently this place is open till late and had very good reviews to so came here. And boy were we not disappointed.We were 8-9 of us so don't even remember what all things we ordered but have a look at some of the pictures. All I remember was we loved every dish that we ordered and were recommended by the staff.Would definitely go here for sure."
48,"Usually, I do not make the effort to write a review, but this time I felt *forced* as the Management hovered over my shoulder til I wrote something. Clearly, I had to be honest so I am reviewing my review, as I do not believe in inauthenticity.Everything would have been alright, even their mediocre Roasted Duck Salad (that they boast about), their Hand Pulled Noodle Soup and their Cantonese Sweet & Sour Pork but the experience was rather unfortunate, thanks to the management. After not being given adequate attention to being given too much attention, especially when you would like to have a private meal, and ""request for a review"" by the server, and after being told by a Mr. Park...read more"
49,Though the place is a fantastic getaway for people who love to dance and party late night. The place offers great food and the music is always great. The only demerit of the place is that it is very expensive but a worth try when you are looking for a safe party place. 
50,This is one of best place to hangout for a late night dinner and party.The management was super cool in terms of hospitality & served us with best Chinese cuisine.Everything about the place was awesome # being a vegetarian Got some scrumptious Cantonese food to eat # DJ played some lovely numbers # the artist on the drum kept every body on toes # Mohit Tomar gave us some good quick service of food and drinks # had very interesting cocktails 🍸 & lip smacking sweet dish .I loved the cake which was the great surprise after the awesome dinner that we had.My experience was awesome in all & my ratings is 5/5
51,The Hong Kong Club is the best place to visit in Delhi for best Chinese cuisine.The chefs are all from China 🇨🇳 & they serve us with best dishes of both veg & non veg .The management is very polite & we enjoyed our date night at the best .We will visit again soon & is highly recommended without any commercials. My ratings 5/5
52,"We had a very bad experience in another restaurant and had come here with low expectations. But I must say we had a fabulous evening with great food, good service. We ordered 5 mains and all were great. The stir fry vegetables were super and the bok Choy was amazing too. Chicken was the only dish which could have been better but was not bad, just a bit over salty. The fried rice was amazing. The icing on the cake was a spectacular dessert which looked fabulous and tasted divine. "
53,"The ambience and dj were above perfect. The food served at bar was good but could be done better, especially the appetisers.Overall good experience."
54,Very Contemporary MetropolitonExcellent Menu and DeliveryGood MusicExotic Ingredients SpaciousClassyHospitable StaffA bit over the top New York ExpensiveA must try!!
55,Bok Choy with rice wine is now one of my favourites because I tried it here and loved it. 👌Their gravy is what made this dish really stand out. 😍The service was quite friendly and welcoming. 😄And the ambience was plain and good 👍
56,Hong Kong club is a very amazing place for the hangout if u are around to aerocity.Best wine and champagne list in the menu. I visited with my Clints there. Ambience is so good and amazing for the staff they are superb specially at the bar Kanchen ashish mukul.I love this.
57,One of the best & hottest selling priority in delhi fetching out the best crowd of Delhi/NCR. Super classy & elite club. Best time to visit on weekends post 8 Pm. Great variety of alcohol & food! Amazing service & its worth every penny! So gear up yourself & visit this amazing club! See you there :) 
58,We had booked this place and even though it was republic day or dry day the next day we still came here just before ten and spent a good two hours here. The food here is extremely top notch and good. Although the portions are not very generous the place itself is grand and has a nice dJ and a violinist that strangely exhibit some nice music for you to enjoy. The waiters and staff are friendly. Buying a bottle of liquor makes more sense if you are more than two couples. We tried around 7 or 8 starters / appetisers and had a bottle of vodka with mixers and our bill came to around 17000. Overall much recommended. 
59,An experience completely. I am glad I could go here. It's a lovely place awesome music and the team at it is so much fun and hospitable. Love the food the dimsums the little detail to the preparation and the presentation. The zodiac cocktails are interesting but what is better is the way they are made and they way they look. It's awesome I could sit at the bar and watch whiley ECLIPSE was being prepared. Gorgeous and happy vibes. 
60,"I went for a launch event that day in Andaz Delhi I heard about this Hong Kong club and I loved having their food and drinks. The Cantonese food is excellent, the music was good, and the staff are excellent!I appreciate how the staff all do their best to make sure you feel important. It's a bit expensive but it's totally worth the money spent. Come here only if you relish authentic Cantonese food. ❤️"
61,"We were just 10 minutes delayed for our reservation and the manager Sohail refused to accommodate our group who were guests at andaz for a bachelorette thereby ruining our plan to party at that place,after asking him multiple times the deals he gave were unreasonable and lost a good amount of business for the club instead. "
62,"🎋♨️✈️ The Hong Kong Club An evening to remember. The Hong Kong Club is a manifestation of the pulsating and reverberating city of Hong Kong. It is located in Aerocity at Andaz Delhi and is a glass-clad structure surrounded by a moat like water body with a separate entry.HKC is a multi-level restaurant, bar, club and lounge, that has created an aura of pronounced chinoiserie ambience, playing on tenors of  colours and classic references.It serves contemporary cantonese cuisine,Chinese Zodiac Signs inspired cocktails and an array of international entertainers.We were welcomed by Sohil Bhargava,who took us for a tour of the swanky Club.

63,"Had heard a lot about this place andbwere eager to try it. We were in a group of 7 seeking to have a good night. We ordered more than 6-7 dishes and 7-8 drinks.Couple of dishes were under cooked. The bao was just un-edible. Moreover there was a piece of stone in the fried rice that my friend chewed upon.Such a disappointment, being a weekend and festival night, it was a disaster for us, specially my fiancee who was fasting whole day to eat this.The staff was polite, the manager, waiter and the chefs came to our table saw the piece of stone and apologised us. When we asked for the check the were kind to settle it due to the inconvenience we faced.For the staff and management its a...read more"
64,"Was told a different cover charge on call (3k) and then a different entry fee - 5k (excluding cover charge) when we reached the place. A very bad experience. Not Recommended. There are better clubs in Delhi - Kitty Su, Keya, or Clique. "
65,Had huge expectations from this place since heard a lot about it. Had few glasses of JD and two dishes. The violin live performance was amazing but sadly that was the only good part. The food was sub par. The chicken dish was all soggy and the momos tasted stale. 
66,"Recently launched in the city, this place is a welcome change. We were welcomed into a spectacular oasis of water bodies, glass walls and well spread out modern Interiors. The enterance is grand though we felt there should be someone stationed to open the doors. It houses a private dining area - with a private bar counter to boot!We started with drinks - interestingly they are Chinese zodiac sign inspired. Drinks were on the house. I settled for the one with black pepper extract and rose inspired - mellow and subtle flavours and a concoction I would never find elsewhere. The starters were recommended by the Manager and were awesome."
67,Went on monday evening and it was totally empty but the place was very good with a good ambience and some nice asian food. Staff was very polite and trained. 
68,"Totally loved the ambience , food , drinks ... a mention for the outstanding service and a very well trained staff ! We tried the drink based on zodiac : simply loved the sleeping dragon ; the lotus stem stiffed with potatoes, cauliflower , water chestnut Dsums , the Baos veg n non veg were oustsnding ! Loved the place 😍😍😍"
69,I have been coming to Hong Kong Kong club for the past 4 months.. I really love the place.. a special shout out to Sahil Kapoor.. he is the best bar tender at the club.. really loved his cocktails.. highly recommend you get your drinks from him !!!
70,"I think I had the best evening of my life here at HK Club. I felt a chillllll down my spine as soon as I entered on a Sunday night at 12am. Even then, the place was although nearly empty, the DJ was killing it with some amazing deep house. We had a couple of drinks and I really liked my jasmine infused gin cocktail. Our bartender was great and the manager Sohil showed us around a bit. Quite a stud he is!I loved the place and could picture a crazy party here. It is a bit expensive - it's worth a visit.. suggest you pre drink and come.Cannot get the music out of my head still . :) "
71,"Avoid like plague .. average food, over priced drinks, and really bad senior staff. There are so many options available today, with better food, reasonably priced drinks, and good staff. No reason to visit this place."
72,"Went last night to celebrate a friend’s birthday. Can’t comment on food as we just had drinks. We had taken a table so we were served pretty well. Being a 5-star property, ambience here is obviously nice and everything is quite expensive. Live music was amazing and they switched to House music after that, which was great. Its opened till 3:30am, so thats an advantage if you’re looking to party longer. We had a good time. "
73,"The hong kong club, located at andaz hyatt Aerocity. One of the most super ambience cantonese food restaurant in town. An expensive restaurant with soft lighting and peaceful music in which one will be lost in a different world.Service is a bit slow here maybe because of the over crowd or other reasons, but it was a bit slow.Coming to the food, i guess my review will not be enough unless you get up and go to this restaurant to taste the best cantonese food ever.Heard of a violin night here, saw some clips of female violin player and she was amazing in the clips, i wonder how it will be like when live.

We were shown to a table immediately but also had the option of a drink at the bar first which I thought was nice. The table was small and cosy, quite romantic. The setting was just right. The service was absolutely fantastic!"

77,An evening well spent with great food and good music ....there was live violin and saxophone.The food was great we ordered chicken and prawn Dumplings which was nice ...the sautéed French beans and Steam rice was the star combination. Loved the Chow mein .

79,"The Hong Kong club has a beautiful vibe to it. The ambience is really nice and has an island bar . Their chicken bao dimsums are my favourite.  Their service is efficient. The saxophonist on the weekends plays extremely well and lights  up the place.  I have had great memories here ! Food quality , service and concept is truely exceptional  ! "
80,"The ambience will make you go Oolala. If you’re able to take your eyes of the ambience, you can move on to socialising with people. But oh wait..I can hear the bilon and the saxophone being played along with some awesome background music. Its not letting me add the videos but definitely a night to remember. Cheers. "
81,"It was a fine day was in the mood to sit and eat somewhere really nice.I saw a picture by my friend while he was at hong kong club, i thought i should try and make a visit there.As soon as i entered, i was treated like a king! The service there is amazing. Food is delicious, the way they actually give a different flavour to every dish is amazing.So this place is for the ones who want a lovely ambience and great music to chill with friends.Thumbs up to the entire Andaz Team. "
82,"Excellent service with warm and courteous staff, food was good and authentic ambience was also perfect as it says Hong Kong Club. Ofcourse leading the legacy of Hyatt as a brand. Can focus on having more varient for drinks and savourys. A must go place with friends and family."
83,Came to the Hong Kong Club 2nd time. Was fantastic as usual. Great service by Gaurav and Abhishek. Awesome night and music. Loved the food. Perfect place to party. saxophonist was amazing.Thanks for the wonderful hospitality
84,The Ambience is very chic and eclectic. The bartenders are well versed with recommendations and its very interesting to sit at their bar. A must go place.  
85,"A place to be. The best cocktails and best food. The ambience is very lively and energetic. There is live music. Special mention for the amazing service by the staff. Staff members served me in the best possible way. Best place to hangout with friends and family also.Amazing place, amazing experience Must try."
86,"We wanted to explore this so hyped so called club. So we went on a Saturday night. To start with it’s nothing like a club. It’s a good dinner and drinks place. Very nicely decor done. Amazing cocktails and food, but what make any hospitality business different is the service, which at Hong Kong Club was really bad. To be specific service by Managers roaming in blue suits, to name one is Mohit. Very arrogant, not at all accommodating. They can do lot better with their staff and service. "
87,"A stupid place to chill dont waste your Saturday night at this stupid place ! No service no one is listening to what you need a crowded place. A silly price to enter so that the place gets full ! Staff full of attitude managers cant handle a thing, pathetic service and evening got ruined. "
88,"Nicely done up place with soothing music. More of a fine dine place than a club,its until very late that the music gets better. The appetizers were decent but the cocktails are a must try. Highlight of the evening was the special performances by the musicians. Do stay for that."
89,"Luxurious place for romantic dinner date. We were very warmly welcomed at the entrance and graciously attended by the staff. We loved the decor and its courteous staff. We ordered Cantonese Chicken, Roasted duck in appetisers. Followed by Battered tiger prawns in WOK section, Stuffed Quail in Barbeque. Its special Chinese zodiac based cocktails are so innovative and creative experience. Every dish is worth every penny, not found it very expensive as heard from others. Totally going to visit again soon."
90,"Had an amazing evening at The Hong Kong Club with wine and appetizers. The food has very authentic taste. Though the portions are less but every bite taste yummy and worth it of every penny. The club has a great combination of cuisine and friendly & well mannered staff. We were well treated by the staff named""Jaswinder"" as all the cuisine we tried under his recommendation was awesome.Also special thanks to the manager named Deepak, for such a well management. Keep it up, the team The Hong Kong Club."
91,"Great Service and very Courteous staff, the ambiance is nice and  casual yet abit on the formal so it kind of fits in all kinds of occasions.the food was nice but the portions were small.The Pork Bao and roasted duck salad very nice but again portions are less so it didn't really hit the spot exactly.all in all yes its a good place to go but nothing very enamouring to make you go the extra mile to go there for something specially.one can get a table till about 10 after that i think its difficult to get a reservation."
92,"As the name says HKC, you would not find anything in relation to Hong Kong, but yes the awesome decor, duplex seating, the fully-stocked up big center-bar, very experienced bar tenders,  the outstanding expat DJ.. complimented with a pro-saxophone player ,  excellent range of high end drinks, the food deserves a big thumps up for its' authenticity and taste....the  courteousness of the staff is simply outstanding..they know how to treat their customers well...pricing is really on the higher side as minimum bill for a couple with drinks would cost you approx 5k+ but then who is complaining for the fantastic music, awesome ambiance, perfect food,  outstanding service and yes..a friendly...read more"
93,Loved the food and ambience. Very well located. And love to visit here again. I hope no one else is offering such kind of menu in aerocity. Great efforts. Thanks.
94,I met with Kanchan who was super warm and helpful in helping us understand our taste and also provide us with a sense of belonging. Also we got the wine of our taste as also the food that was served on the sides!
95,This is the worst ever lounge in entire India. We were 2 couples on Sunday evening . One couple got late - we started ordering drinks . When the other couple came they didn’t allow them entry saying 2 couples can’t get entry even when the entire lounge was empty . Chicken bao sucks - stay away from this place pls. 
96,Great vibe... great service... great cocktails... sunwukong... and Kanchan makes them the best... a must visit... specially on Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday... Friday and Saturday come early... just amazing...
97,Came to Andaz for a weekend getaway and decided to dine at The shingling Club for a nice cozy family dinner. While the drinks and cocktails were amazing the food was not as amazing to our expectation. The price v/s quantity was not justified. While the ambience is aimed at keeping the upscale vibes high it is the food that doesn’t justify. The service is outstanding and people are very friendly and courteous. Can drop in once for sure for an experience. 
98,Loved the entrance ...... awesome music.... amazing place ....... great place to chill with friends 💞💕🥂we ordered a thai style tofu dish yummy it was and chicken  cooked in pan asian style was awesome . Food ordered  was as per recommendation of the service staff . 🥂🥂
99,"What a place! A large club cum lounge ambience which turns into a full fledged club post 11 pm, this place has everything the night hoppers of Delhi look for. And even if it’s just food you’re interested in, this place will not disappoint.AmbienceSoft, subtle lighting with a smooth club decor. The lights are dimmed and music amped up post 11 pm. You can keep the party on till 4 in the morning - a rare treat for all the bar mongers of Delhi NCR.FoodServing Cantonese food, The Hong Kong Club is focused on a cuisine that may be new to Indian palette. Cantonese food, by nature, is slightly sweet. By sweet, I don’t mean dessert sweet, but you won’t find any hot dishes on the menu...read more"

103,Amazing ambience and hospitality. Music and decor was top notch. Although the place was a little empty on weekdays but on weekends it's one of the best party in town
104,"If you want to have a feel of luxury , this is the place. You might feel it a little over expensive but for a night I totally loved it. I tried their dimsums and I forgot to take the picture because they were so delicious 🙈. Drinks were fantastic , crowd was nice , staff was great.Totally loved the experience. Would recommend this place for sure for a luxury experience. Cheers 🍻"

106,"Great place good food , could have a better quantity , great service @kanchan good job with the service n suggestions . Had a nice time , she made us a mocktail off the list which was awesome "
107,"I visited this over hyped restaurant/ club on Saturday.On making a reservation I spoke to Miss X (not naming her as i have nothing personal against her). The conversation was as follows:She: ma’am we have only one table available for the night which is at ground floor.Me: This is my first visit so I wouldn’t know the best area/ table so please guide wellShe: yes ma’am ground floor is the most happening.On reaching the place, she, with a poker face  says “ma’am your table is reserved on first floor”I reminded her the conversation over the phone and she said “no ma’am we don’t have any table on the ground floor as I told you on the phone”. Of course her sheer lie...read more"
108,Ashish is a great bartender!!!..great food and cocktails.. had a great timeLoved the dim sums. Music was awesomeLoved the place and the crowd  
109,"I went to this place recently and i must say that it was amazing. I fell in love with the ambience. How can we not talk about the food. I loved their range of dimsum and desserts. The staff is also very courteous and helpful. I remember one of them his name was Sahil, he suggested us some drink and food according to our preferences. He will definately make sure that you get something which is absolutely according to your preference."
110,"Excellent food!! Very good staff especially Kanchan and Mohit. Thoroughly enjoyed our Friday night with some great music, cocktails and food!!! Highly recommend this place!!!"
111,Kanchan is excellent. The Hong Kong Club is the best. Lovely vibe and a great time.Hong Kong club is a nice destination for those looking for a night out in Delhi. Lot of great drinks and company.
112,"BUZZING !! BRILLIANT !!! BOOMBASTIK .... What a Place ... Totally Reminds me of Hakkasan Bar Nights. Cocktails are little expensive but worth the efforts and the ingredients. MMMM Music yes.... they can work a bit but after 2 Cocktails you guys will love the Music too , BTW They just play EDM. Food is Supergood but the quantity is way to less. Overall it was a memorable experience for us... Go Guys Go.... Go Gang Go ... You will love the experience."
113,"amazing ambience.. lovely peeps.. courteous staff..Kanchan you are pretty good at your work👍😀A must visit place in Delhi..the food, the music, dj all makes the night memorable."
114,"Did you know, entry for couples not allowed after 1 am?Dont waste your time with the managers at the gate Pisyush something and Mohit another thing.Shady as always Delhi scene can be."
115,Amazing place enjoyed a lot Ashish shah was serving he was so good best place to chill must visit to hongkong club love it best place in delhi to enjoy seriously hotel andaz Crazy fun 
116,Am at Hongkong club . Great and rocking place .. needless to mention nice ambience and always smiling staff .. and yes the girl at bar counter KANCHAN is just great at nice cocktails.. and service too ... enjoying with friends. ..cheers Hongkong club 
117,"I have been planning for sometime to go here and finally was able to visit here last weekend. I would suggest it should be a goto weekend place. Brilliant ambience,courteous staff and nice music. Incase I have to think and take out a flaw,the only one I can think is the menu,it’s little less but I guess it’s apt for the place. I along with my wife had a great time here "
118,"It has to do with me and the group I went with, I'm guessing that we didn't enjoy The Hong Kong Club.We all felt that while it is expensive, it's not necessarily worth the price paid. There were those odd dishes that we liked, but overall, especially for us vegetarian folk there wasn't anything other than beans and spinach."
119,This place by far has been the most spectacular experience..!! Courteous staff.. breathtaking ambience.. mouth watering food...what else could you demand for? Worth every peny... planning to go there again soon..!! I think Delhi 5 stars should bring up more places like these... absolute touch of royalty..!!
120,"Four star for the decore and ambience. very welcoming place. Entrance fire lamps and the grand entrance creat a environment of Old Hong kong village. staff is very efficient. service is real fast. food is above average.we had ordered lotus root which i did not like. cauliflower, red Chinese cabbage Dimdum was awsome. crispy noodle were decent but not my favorite.The most amazing part of the restaurant is their grand restrooms. love this place. will visit again. "
121,"Nice and clean place(Aerocity), lively atmosphere, best staff, good interiors of club and nice exteriors of hotel it is situated inFood nicely presented , acrobat performance , good music, live bar counter at the centre,entrance the fire cylinders surrounded by water everything made the club to be of international level.."
122,"I went there food is not for Indian taste I was looking Chinese or something, I don’t like these type of food but it was tasty and delicious but food verity is too less, they should increase food verity and ambience was very good in Aerocity area."
123,The food and ambience was very luxurious. The best part about the food was it was with the right mix of spices and i love food when the spices are right.
124,So we visited the restaurant for out Anniversary dinner.The ambience was perfect and classy.The food though was average. There were not many options for vegans. Though the place seemed perfect for some late evening drinks. We left around 10 pm when the crowd seemed to be building up.
125,"Visited the Hong Kong club on Saturday after hearing a lot about this place from friends.Grand is the word apt for this place great interior very nicely done up.the drinks menu is quite interesting serving all sorts of cocktails,A very classy place, not to forget the very friendly staff specially the bartender Kanchan who served us she was spot on and quick in serving us and had good knowledge about cocktails and drinks.surely an amazing place to visit on weekends .!keep up the great work Hong Kong club."
126,"It was my birthday... took my parents to this place... let’s say it was a perfect evening for me... let’s start from the temperature which was so perfect that we felt that the weather was such!! The Ambience and interiors and the vibe is really top notch, international club feel where you feel you are transported to a club on miami!! The music was to die for.. my parents were itching to dance .. my mom’s fractured ankle kept them. Service: A class.. right from the entrance.. everyone made sure my mom was comfortable, the chef “ANAN” curated a special meal for us to cater to my parents taste buds... to top it all up... the Ariel acrobat dance... splendid.. start to end perfect.....read more"
127,The hong kong club has a classy ambience with a courteous staff well versed in english. The food is delicious. A perfect restaurant to visit for an amazing evening. Highly recommended.Ty Ms. Kanchan fr d mocktail as well as mouth watering dessert☺️☺️
128,"We went there on a busy evening and I must say that the staff was just amazing, in terms of food and cocktails I am sure it is the best so far what I have tasted. The best thing was that the cocktails were as per our Chinese zodiacs the eclipse and monkey cocktail was simply outrageous. Coming on the food we tried three of the dim sums and they were exceptional. The roast duck was so far the best I ever had.  On the price point it is a bit expensive but I guess that’s justified by the amazing experience we had"
129,Visited this pace last night and had a fantastic time. Cantonese chicken was out of the world. we also tried the mixed mushroom which was excellent but the star dish was Roast duck!! 😍 Peeyush was amazing and got us some fabulous cocktails which were very different.
130,This restaurant is the epitome of culinary  excellence and has definitely set a benchmark for crafted cocktails. Their speciality is that they make cocktails based on a person’s Chinese Zodiac and their attention to detail is mind blowing! I had the best time dining here and can’t wait to experience more of it soon!
131,it is very delicious. we like it.balbir kaur is very nice and beautiful. and service is also good. The environment is vey nice.from chinese friend review.
132,"My third time in the hotel , it always amazes me with new and better things to look forward to. My experience at HKC was simply amazing as I couldn’t have asked for better service/ food . The hospitality shown by the staff was truly superb and shows the training and importance given in the hotel.. We were 3 couples and went for dinner and drinks on a Friday night. The music playing was perfect as we love EDM and house music.. The manager( Piyush)  made sure we got the best of everything .. the place was pretty full and the crowd was good as well. So we felt in the right place. 9 out of 10 on the food , 10/10 on the drinks , must try the different cocktails.."
133,"Went with great expectations, however came back disappointed. The food was nothing greater than ordinary and the restaurant was not at all value for money. Portions were small. Only good thing we’re the deserts - creme brulee and tipsy chocolate brownie. Not recommended."
134,Ashish Shah provide excellent service thank your And the food was excellent.  Perfect stay very nice place Hospitality is outstanding. Will come back next time 
135,"This place has a nice ambience and good vibe and music. The service was excellent and special mention to Karan Sharma for the excellent care taken by him. The food was good but not great, but it may be because we were seeking only the vegetarian fare."
136,"Friendly and polite staff, loved the interior’s and the ambience.  The food was delightful Ashish was outstanding with his work. Definitely a visit "
137,"Great place,very different and Delhi badly needs such places,only good vibes,killer house music,fabulous service.Specially Kanchan,outstanding bartender!! A must visit."
138,"Wonderful experience it was. Sahil was very kind and welcoming, he suggested really very delicious items. I would definetely come back again for sure 😊"
139,"Classy 'modern' Cantonese is the name of the game at this 3 months new joint at Andaz Aerocity. The place launched with a reasonable level of pomp and show over Dec-Jan months and thereafter I haven't seen too much more being spoken about them. The place is spread over different levels, with a planned disco in the basement (that's not yet open) and seated fine dine on ground and first floors. The menu predominantly is modern cantonese, so limited comparison benchmarks around in the NCR region .On weekend Nights, the ground floor here is converted into a dance floor AFTER 11pm, with a drinks and a limited-food-menu.The food:Dishes we liked: Hongkong Duck and Crispy Pork Belly.Dishes...read more"
140,Now where is the after party .... it is here at the Hong Kong Club. Massive & Granduer for a club / pub .. sone amazing cocktails equally complementing music ! You cant go wrong here as long as it is an after  party ! The food still needs to make it up to match the expectations of the taste buds as expected from such a high end place ! Beware this place is heavy on the wallet... don’t tell me If i did not warn you!Food aside the place is top notch with amazing drinks to complement !
141,"A Great place to hang out with friends to chill, chit chat  ... its got lovely ambience,  good music  and some good food too... definitely a place to check out !! "
142,"Went for dinner. It is a restaurant which turns into a club and by 11ish it is more of loud sound and then fine dining place to catch up with friends. Food wise everything is okay. All the starters and main course we ordered were above average or good but nothing outstanding. Peking duck had a nice twist - instead of a roll the option was eat it in a Bao. But then unlike China Kitchen at Hyatt Regency, here we had to prepare the duck in the bao. Dimsums - prawn, chicken pork - were above average but again nothing outstanding. Decor and service is good. Entry is something they need to work on - your best bet is to enter opposite Pullman hotel rather than the main entry. If you enter...read more"
143,Best place in the city to hangout...The Dj lady plays very good music 🎧....Table needs to to be booked on the weekends...They serve the drink 🍷 🍸 based on the zodiac sign or birth year...just tell the waiter about about the birth year he will let you know the best drink for you...The Chinese menu syncs one to the streets of China     🇨🇳.....The low light ambience is very attractive..The bar tender “Tin tin” is very cool guy...Many celebrities are spotted on the weekends.
144,Excellent service and authentic Cantonese food !!! A great experience overall !!! Kudos to Ashish for the great service!! They even got me a special dessert for my bday...
145,"This restaurant is possibly one of the best I've been to. After a long day of travelling we were so hungry and since we were staying in the hotel it was convenient for us to come here. We were shown to a table immediately but also had the option of a drink at the bar first which I thought was nice. The table was small and cosy, quite romantic. The setting was just right. The service was absolutely fantastic! The food was exactly what we needed and was perfect. I have nothing negative to say about this restaurant."
146,Kanchan Fartiyal “bartender”..she was the best serving you the great drinks with different flavours. The best bartender in town with a pretty smile & a great gesture. Must visit this place! Hongkong Club is best at it on saturday’s !! Make sure u have Sun Wukong!!
147,This is definitely a super place for Cantonese food!! The servers would understand your pallet and would then suggest u the dishes-they have thorough knowledge about all the dishes and that’s what I liked the most about this place. I went her with my husband for our Anniversary evening and enjoyed the food to the core... 5 stars for the ambience! From their dimsums to fried noodles to wok to their dessert everything was just a masterpiece of culinary art! 
148,I have been too many Restaurant but my favourite is the hongkong club.my love for this place eternal.Amazing food makes me happy and so does this food 😊 
149,One of the best Bars in Delhi. Amazing place to visit on weekends. Must try are flamed cocktails and their inhouse drinks with japanese Spices. 
150,"Extremely poor service for average food. So we came here for dinner and they sat us down at the table. Then they completely forgot about us. No menu, no water, nothing. I had to get up and go to the waiter in their area to get him. Then he handed us one menu for two people and forgot about us again. We then called the waiter and ordered our food. When he came with our food, he brought our main course and no starters. We reminded him about our starters and he said it’s on the way. 45 mins later, our main course was finished and no starters. We constantly reminded the waiter about the starters, to which the reply was “sorry sir, the kitchen is very busy”. I finally told him to either...read more"
151,"Amazing place, great ambience,great food, great service and cocktails here are a must tryIts a fine dine restaurant till 10 pm and then turns into a club, very good hospitality aswellAshish 👍🏻👍🏻"
152,"Loved every bit of the time spent.... It's was a Monday evening but had enough people to make the place look good! Good staff and great food and beverage selection.... It might come across as a costly restaurant to dine, but then satisfaction is guaranteed!"
153,"Classy place to say the least! some drinks are based on your chinese zodiac and they were reallyyy unique and potent. Loved my drink which was gin based with lime milk washed lime cordial and had gold dust on the top. The private dining room was elite and and so was the bar. they have cantonese food and some of the things like the duck bao, dark mousse and the dimsums were really good. specially imported or specially grown veggies have been used for all the food and you could make out the freshness in the taste. check out this cool bar!"
154,The club is sprawling and grand to say the least. the main bar is so well designed. the service was super and each and every server had great knowledge of what they were serving. Cantonese food at its best and do try the dimsums. Dont miss the cocktails that are according to your chinese zodiac. A must try place for a good night!
155,"Everything we ordered was packed with flavour and accompanied with a great ambiance. The black bean chicken is a must order and the asparagus for veggie lovers. Our server, Ashish was very friendly and contributed to a wonderful experience. "
156,Food taste is just awesome..!!As far as Ambience and music is concerned that made me crazy All the best team Service staffs were very polite and courteousWould love to come back soon
157,"Okay. I have been to many places, but this place has the most AMAZING drinks, whether it be cocktails or mocktails.Loved the ambience, a truly enriching experience.Would recommend the Scorpion drink, an exquisite drink.Must visit place! Thumbs up!"
158,We were holding The Hong Kong Club review for the new year so that we could start with something nice. The Hong Kong Club is part of the luxury hotel Andaz in Aerocity New Delhi and is a venture by Hyatt hotels. It is a sought after venue for luxury events like celebrity parties and Page3 events. We were curious to know what made this place such an obvious choice for fine dining and indulgent evenings.
159,"Visited The Hong Kong club for dinner. The ambience was unlike most clubs/ bars in delhi and was designed very well. However, the food did not match up to the ambience. We ordered : 1. shanghai chicken dimsums: 4/5 The dimsums for flavourful and succulent. 2. Prawn crystal dumplings: 3.5/5 These dumplings could have been more flavourful and tender but were still enjoyable 3. Cantonese chicken: 3.5/5 The chicken was tender and flavourful but the skin was not consistent 4. Butterfly prawns: 2.5/5 These prawns were extremely average as they lacked flavour and were not crispy and very oily 5. Barbecue pork ribs: 3/5 The pork was not tender and the portion was very small 6. Corn and...read more"
160,The newest entrant  to the ever bustling and dynamic food and beverage options in the Aerocity .This place located in Hyatt Andaz has a separate entrance and a very holiday like feel with a party buzz !The ambience is very chic and eclectic The cocktails are based on the year of your birth and they have Chinese coasters to depict the same . The bartenders are well versed with recommendations and it's very interesting to sit at their island bar .I tried the Sleeping dragon cocktailA beautiful multilayered whisky cocktail which had been aged in barrels This is definitely the place to watch out for !Kudos to the team and management 
161,"A very classy place in Aerocity. The best thing about this place is the bar. The bar side seating is lively and the bartenders are amazingly spot on and quick. Their cocktails menu, crafted as per your Chinese zodiac signs, is a must try. I didn't get the chance to try the food that night but the drinks and music got me going. The ambience of the place makes it one of the best bar setting in Delhi for me. "
162,"They deserve every bit of praise they have been showered with after their recent opening – the food is distinct and it is good.  The atrium architecture gives you a feeling of space as you settle into your seat. You will of course start with their zodiac cocktails, never mind if you choose one that is not your sign – my Sleeping Dragon, scotch and martini, was smooth, yet potent, my wife’s Moon Rabbit, a jasmine gin and champagne number, lemony and sharp. We had ordered our dimsums and soup and were sipping our drinks. Our server comes over and says “in Cantonese food, we serve as soon as dish is prepared, so your soup come first or dimsum, we do not say which”. This line of...read more"

168,"There are a few proper clubs in Delhi that attract good footfalls, but its more of a disappointment eventually as most of the places fail to retain their hype and standards over a period of time. I do feel the city badly needed a multi dimensional place like what Shiro used to be as it offered grandeur, great interiors and coupled with good food. The place started off as a restaurant and in the dark before dawn, became a club. THE HONGKONG CLUB at the Andaz hotel too does that, and first impressions are quite good.It just had a glitzy launch but now is the time of reckoning as the real customers will start walking in.
