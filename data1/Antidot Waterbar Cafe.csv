0,"Horrible food, untrained staff, slow service. Nobody listens to you, food is average or below average"
1,Great ambiance along with great food. 10/10 would recommend to anyone looking for a chilled out place to hangout. 
2,Fantastic Service.Food is deliciousMaumita was amazing helped with lots of options available.Would love to come again üíï................
3,Great food and an even better great ambiance to go along with the food. The live music really adds onto the experience. 
4,"None of the staff wore any masks, maintained distance or sanitized hands. It is a COVID land. They put everyone at risk. The staff, the other dine in guests everyone was extremely careless. I am scared that we may have been exposed to the virus. Upon that, the service was horrible, the food was stale, expensive and not worth the wait. Really disappointed and now scared for our health. "
5,No measures of covid-19. Staff is very rude and non supportive. Portion size of starters are very skewed. Not at all value for money. Except ambience everything else is not worthy. Waiters will only help if you know them otherwise they will listen to you but won‚Äôt act.
6,What a amazing place to hangout with friends...quality of food is amazing....great hospitality.....
7,It‚Äôs a amazing place like my 2nd home....and I hope this is a best place in south Delhi...it‚Äôs very nice ambiance...food quality is too good..staff is very nice....
8,Good foodGood staffAmbience is goodMust go oncePolite staffOverall 4/5
9,"I wish there was a lower rating option than one Star. The whole page of the restaurant doesn't mention anything about a dress code. We weren't allowed to enter the place because of wearing casual lower pants. I didn't know that to visit ""casual dining"" place we need to dress up. At the least ease mention such stuff in Your information so that no one wastes their time and comes all the way to the restaurant and then has to go back with the worst experience without even entering the place."
10,Horrible and unprofessional place. Booked ourselves for Brunch on Christmas after telecon with the Manager. After reaching found out the restaurant is not even open and no brunch either! Will never come back 
11,Perfect for partying üòªüíï and 
12,Exceptional food and cocktails. And great service by Mr. Vivek.5 stars for the service itself. Will surely come here again.
13,"An amazing lunching experience, the terrace is a plus one and the sunlight made it even more better, i would totally recommend the veg platter and the pizza, mouth watering indeed."
14,Cocktail and food was good. Open area is good. Service is really slow. I called the staff multiple times but a lot of ignorant behaviour. Staff behaviour was really careless. 
15,"Worst service ever. And the manager was irresponsible. Staff was not cooperative. They were rude and standing on the head asking for paying the bill fast and leave the table. Only think that i appreciate is of hookah and the person who made that was Hrithik and he was decent too and suggested some good flavoured Hookah. Overall experience was very bad. I also requested the manager for shifting the table as we have ordered much and there was quite less space on the table and he denied. I won't visit ever this cafe again overpriced,over hyped. I am a food blogger and they don't even respect them"
16,It was very sad that I have paid tax more than what I have eaten with the drinks..plus the alcohol that we have ordered is too expensive and the food quality is pathetic.
17,Amazing place ....good food good hospitality...thanks moumita.........................................................
18,"The rooftop ambience is gorgeous, they have a great view too! The Pina colada was really good, we tried the alfredo spaghetti which exceeded our expectations, and then the Thai green curry which was served with rice, which was also surprisingly really good. We were very happy with everything we ordered, and if you're okay with the price being a little towards the higher side, I'd definitely recommend it. "
19,The place is amazing. Great vibe . Great singing .  Loved it. Food also tastes great .Really enjoyed our time .Will definitely  visit again
20,"Visited this place for the first time great experience, good hospitality by moumita,including the other staff. Keep up the good work. Cheers ‚ò∫Ô∏è"

47,Good service and food was amazing great experience Will visit here again.  Service was very punctual. 
48,"Visited on a Saturday evening. Let‚Äôs just say the only thing good about this place is the rooftop but THAT IS IT. i‚Äôm surprised this place even comes in the listing of  ‚Äòartisan cocktails‚Äô because it‚Äôs the only place which messed up a Whiskey Sour. Literally the only place where I couldn‚Äôt even sip the drink it was so bad. I told to change it and the second one also was pathetic to say the least, smelling of egg , i mean how messing up a classic cocktail is as bad as it gets. On top of that i paid for two Whiskey sours even though the second one was a replacement of the first. Super slow service, extremely bland food , the servers are weird...read more"
49,"I came across this place on Zomato a month back and I didn't know it would turn out to be one of the best experiences. I visited the place yesterday again and I was still awestruck. Everything is so amazing, starting from the ambience, the view to the food and drinks. The only thing that could have been a bit better was the service. The staff could have been a bit more proactive. However the guy who made the sheesha was very attentive and kept a regular check. Overall had a great dining experience. Would definitely visit again for another evening of relaxation."
50,"An Average place with below average crowd openly blowing up cigrates all around and the food quantity is very small. Literally like we were 2 people and we usually order maximum 3 items wherever we go, but here had to order 5 items to satisfy our apetite as the food portion was very small and the price was over expensive in comparison and taste was also below average. Over all so so place. Me personally Will never visit again."
51,"Loved the experience, due to allergies chef himself personalised dishes and recommended some. Loved the ambience. Delicious food."
52,Amazing food. Amazing service Beautiful outdoor seating Great ambience Loved the overall experience and will surely love to visit this place again super soon 
53,"Amazing service,Awesome food,Good ambience,Well mannered bartenders.Loved the overall experiance...would love to visit again "
54,"Even after reserving the table 4 hours prior i wasn‚Äôt able to get the spot, and the manager casually said that sir its crowded today, so what? Pathetic behaviour of manager and other staff as well. "
55,"Beautiful outdoor seating, best time to visit on Sundays they have live music as well. Very inexpensive and tasty food "
56,"Antidot Waterbar Cafe recently opened, is a cool new hangout joint with its handpainted artsy interiors of beautiful artwork with brown woodwork, touches of green which gives it a very bohemian feel. In the day a cafe and by night a bar with a DJ for a rocking party. Best known for their one of a kind hookah flavors which has fans coming from across town, to their beer festival of premium flavored beer (not home brewery beer) off orange, blackberry, apple and fabulous cocktails like Spring Fling, Whiskey Sour, The Lost Ocean (this is fabulous it has an ice cube in the centre with another drink in it), Let The Clouds Roll By and It Came With The Flood (such wonderful names).

60,"- Ambience is nice IF you get a good seating away from mosquitoes and lizards on 4th floor- Parking: You will be charged a 100 for valet despite calling it as their official parking partner and they literally left the car where I gave them. Wow!- Food is simply pathetic in a word. To add details: stale and chewy chicken, masala papad is busted(imagine how can one make this dish incorrect, like 2 ounces of salt on it) and those of you who are thinking that nachos can be a safe choice, yes they are! Nachos Sprinkled with cheese is what you call nachos then yes! No beans no veggies!Now coming to drinks and the super slow and unbearable service.

62,"I went here yesterday for dinner. The waiter sanitised our seats and table in front of us. The ambience is lovely and that‚Äôs the USP here. Rooftop Ambience is gorgeous with lush greenery and blue lights that go with the theme.We ordered Baos, Mushroom Tikka, Garden Pizza and Mezze Platter.Everything was served hot and tasted good. Baos came with spicy sauce that gave it a nice kick. Pizza was my favourite. Thin crust and loaded with vegetables.I loved Mushroom Tikka as well. Must try!We also tried their signature cocktails. Watermelon Mojito was serves in the Watermelon itself. It had pulpy pieces which made the taste fresh and authentic.The place had live IPL screening as well...read more"

The staff is courteous, everyone was following safety norms! Chicken Biryani - The love of every north indian! The biryani was very flavourful, had 4 pieces in a portion and was enough for 2 people! The rice was cooked nicely, masala was there in every bite! 4.5/5 - My Rating (as there‚Äôs always a scope for improvement). Chicken Bao - This was a dish that i wanted to try, as there are pretty few restaurants in the city where we‚Äôd get good ones, they surprised us with great presentation...read more"
67,Very nice and hygienic food very nice service provided a good discount and staff was very Friendly & respectfull nice ambience nice place to chill 
68,One of the amazing please to enjoy if u like open seating places but the service is a bit slow and did not allow us to pay through Zomato gold even when it was showing open..so do check before they confuse you..good quality of food 
69,"1st they take hours to sanitize the table then also gimmick to do so by just roaming with a broken machine, then they take ages to bring the order after all the headache then they tell you though they appear on Zomato dining but they will bill you originally in the 1st place so they can bill you on the higher front.Big time disappointment never visiting this place again none was worth it."

79,Amazing food and ambience.Really great for birthdays.
80,"The place has a great big rooftop with good view and I think that's the USP for this place in the area around Safdarjung, live music and outside setting make it a choice for a visit, but surely restaurant needs a little improvement in food as we couldn't find butter chicken or pizza good and so does the desserts, but still, worth to visit"
81,"Decent place in safdarjung area with good food menu. We tried classic tomato soup, tomato and basil bruschetta, paneer tikka sampler and dahi ke kebab sticks. Food was yummy. Staff was courteous. We wanted to sit on rooftop but it was full because it was winters and a sunny day. The place was giving a dingy vibe due to the color of walls. But overall a decent place to visit."
82,"When we first sat down, one of us had our water bottle with her due to the coronavirus scare. We were directly told by the server that we cannot keep that with us and it would be given back to us when we leave. We tried to explain that it's just water and we are carrying it because it's hoe boiled water. But he insisted that he cannot allow us to keep our water and we have to drink the restaurant water. We had a good 5 min fight with those guys after which we were allowed to keep the water. Then when we ordered we ordered a few drinks, one of them was a rose sangria berry. When the drinks came, it was clearly a white wine sangria which we asked the server that we had asked for a rose...read more"
83,Visit only if you get to sit on the terrace. Amazing ambience and great service. The food wasn‚Äôt that great and because of the cold weather it was getting cold again and again even though the servers had heated the food again for us. Won‚Äôt recommend pizza . Go for small plates since they were good. The chicken tikkas were amazing and so were the cocktails . We tried the paan cocktail and the ice ball cocktail both were amazing
84,"Our server mr. Vibhu was very attentive and soft spoken. Do ask for him for a good service. The ambience was nice, there was live music and we got our table at a good spot. A evening well spent with friends"
85,Roshan was very nice in terms of serving.. Nice ambience
86,"Great rooftop place with water bar on side. Perfect place for spending quality time without any hustle bustle along with good food.The food menu is vast and so many dishes to choose from. Smoked Mushroom Galauti was really nice. Perfect spice and good quantity. Chicken sliders was so delicious that we are coming back just for that.Since I visited in winters, I ordered Hot Toddy in drinks. Man that was amazing and such a relief in cold weather."

91,A good service by nice Staff Mr. Vikas.. really love to come again.
92,"It is certainly the place you would want to visit once if you are around Safdurjung, we were seated at rooftop and view & ambiance was good. Live music arrangement was also there...place is not very spacious and can accommodate few guest at rooftop. Main restaurant inside was empty as i believe due to weather everyone wanted outside seat.. food was good, we ordered mains and were not disappointed. Beer selection was limited and have to zero down on whats available (i hate kingfishers) ..  overall good, nothing spectacular, once a visit kinda"
93,"Heard about this place from a colleague and about their Butter Chicken. Being a hardcore butter chicken lover, I couldn't stop myself from trying it atleast once. So it is in Safdarjung Enclave. A nice looking property spacious seating. I straightaway ordered Butter Chicken with 2 butter naans.So they had this unique flavours probably because in their menu it was written Chicken Makhani. So the gravy was not the genuine one yet very tasty. Even though it was not what I was expecting, I got something great to taste. The pieces were succulent. Loved it!"
94,"Antidot is a cool hangout place with beautiful artsy interior. The food and drinks were great and well presented and tasted good. However there is scope for improved service as we had to wait for a while, to get the order. "

Fish & fries was the only good thing that we had. But portions of all the dishes were too small.Ambience & decor - at the rooftop the things & feel were good but on rest of the floors it wasn't impressive at all."

197,"Chose this place to meet a few friends for a late lunch. It was a Tuesday afternoon and I was the only person there at that time. They were playing very loud music and I had to tell them to lower the volume because I was not being able to talk to my friends. They did that after some time but it was still too loud. The food was fine - not exceptional but not bad either. The chilli paneer was just fine, so was the pizza. I liked the veg galouti kebab the best - it was really soft and full of flavour. The virgin mojito was prepared well. Overall, a good experience but it could have been better."
198,"You should be selective about the entry of stags as our experience was totally ruined by group of four already drunk guys, irritating us and was invading our table space..We immediately had to get our food pack and leave.."

223,"On a day with almost no crowd on the rooftop, we asked to change the table as we were not comfortable. But were denied with no explanation. Also, the food portions were lesser than expected for the price paid. I am not hoping to return anytime soon."

They have heaters, live music and offers on drinks. Our table was managed by Vinay and he‚Äôs the best server we could‚Äôve asked for. He took care of each replenishment which is really rare these days. They have a huge variety of menu however I suggest ask your server what‚Äôs special and go with that. They know what‚Äôs best ;)"

Kebab, soya keema french fries( a must try), a fruit mocktail with red bull, 3 type paneer tikka and last but not the least their wonderful dessert snickers with brownie,caramel, icecream with chocolate flakes and sauce! The only thing which was not good was their Garlic bread. Instead of cheese they served paneer which did not taste so good and was spicy as well. But rest everything apart from this was perfect! The dishes I mentioned are a must try! And Thanks to Ankit for his hospitalityüôÇ"

Nice location.Food: I ordered chicken kothey. It turned out to be bad. I suddenly felt that I should have believed the reviews. But then the chef came and understood the problem. Unlike other places where they get defensive, he was more acceptable and understood the problem. He gave a chef special dish. And it was amazing!! Must try there fish in lemon butter sauce.

293,"Went for my birthday and the staff was pathetic..We ordered pizza, macaroni and mocktails..Pizza was quite normal and everything was overpriced..Also, when we were clicking our pictures their staff got nothing to do except making us uncomfortable..I went to this place because of its ambience but after the rude behaviour of staff would never recommend this place to anyone..I have been to many cafes and restraunts but this was the worst one because of their staff..Ruined my birthday."
294,"The place is located in safdarjung... A little off the main area... we went there with our cousins for our anniversary Celebrations and enjoyed. The music and atmosphere was enjoyable and the ambience was really nice. Seating arrangements for a big group should be improved a little the benches are high the back support is uncomfertable.The food tasted amazing and was presented beautifully.. we had farm fresh pizza, beer battered chicken, tandoori prawns, quesadilla, mushroom pasta and dimsums, we also had a few cocktails.

296,"Decent food, prompt service and a good locality. The ambience was fun, especially the terrace area. Definitely a sundowner place with the right kind of drink in your hand. "

Even took time getting our food. When the time came for the payment, they took the card and came back 15 mins later saying the card machine isn't working. "
309,"It was a bright Sunday, so we couldn't sit outside for our evening get together. Quick service, decent food. Drinks were very well made.Tasted honey chilli potatoes, nachos, pizza and pasta.

311,"For the first time I tried this restaurant and it was awesome. First of all, the service, the staff was really good. Secondly, the food was really awesome. I really like their interior also. They have two floors to themselves which is pretty cool. The cocktails served was Antidote Colada and Breaking the flow ( mixer of wine and whiskey ) which was way too good for me. The taste, the flavour was awesome. It was crafted by them with love. In food I had Nasi Goreng ( Indonesia dish), mini burgers, non veg and veg kebabs and Chicken Nachos. Everything was so fulfilled with flavours and it was damn tasty. Highly recommended and try anything, you will love it. Hope to visit again....read more"

313,"Bad staff. Rude behaviour. Service charge as per the law is discretionary. We were forced to pay. Was there to scout location for my office party. Will not recommend this place to anyone. Insofar as the food goes, we called for peri peri chicken supreme and the portion was really for the price they charged. "

319,"My friends and I went to this cafe for my birthday celebrations. The ambience and the interiors are really good. We sat on the rooftop. Even after making a booking we were asked to change the table three times. Well, that is that. We even tried using zomato gold and it didn't work. They completely refused to use it which is quite sad. Apart from that, the sprinklers were way too many. We were all sweating profusely because of the humidity there. We ordered white sauce pasta, Peri Peri pizza, LIIT strawberry, LIIT apple, pan mocktail, tandoori platter, Hummus platter. The food was good. The pasta had barely any vegetables even though we'd asked them specifically to add veggies. They had...read more"
320,Superb rooftop.The menu seems to have good price but the quantity is also like half a portion. :( We ended up ordering like 5 dishes between 3 persons. 
321,"The place was amazing and the location was quite decadent. Apart from that the interiors were quite unique when they are set to their full capacity. The name water bar holds some merit as they had a water theme tables with water connected with the side railing g also filled with water & sprinklers. If you‚Äôre going for the interiors you wouldn‚Äôt be as surprised as you think. Apart from that their cocktails are really amazing and if you visit the place, they are a must.

324,Sarfaraz is the guy who served us. He was good. 
325,"I have to start by saying that the experience at Antidot was surprisingly unexpected. I was surprised that such a hangout exists in Delhi. The service was fabulous and the vibe of this establishment was unreal. There was live music, which surprised me, not only because it was there, but also because the sound and vibe of Antidot really complemened the talent of the performers. Ordering was easy and the service was as quick as a jiffy. The food we were served was quite appetising and had amazing flavours. I was even more pleasantly surprised when the bar manager served a special drink off the menu for me. All in all, it was really a wonderful and pleasantly surprising treat. Antido, in my...read more"

328,BYOAC- bring your own ACThe place is not even .1% how it looks like in the photos. The staff is rude.The place is really small. The terrace is still fine but if you are sitting indoors you will have to get you own AC with you Once u are inside u‚Äôll keep complaining about the Ac. DJ is a big time fail on a Sunday. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend anyone to got to this place. It‚Äôs all photoshopped

332,Good place with helping staff and delicious food 
333,"The place was small and conjusted , not like it seems in the pictures and food was very average , we ordered a garden fresh pizza, paneer tikka and amritsari kulcha, only paneer tikka was fine rest was tasteless and specially service was very slow and staff was taking no interest in attending the customers, only one thing we liked was the watermelon cooler"
334,"I'm quite surprised the place has such good reviews. Went there to catch up with some friends on a Saturday evening. We reached at around 7-7:15PM and decided to take indoor seating because of the humid weather outside. That didn't work out too well because their AC wasn't turned on/or working properly. One of the waiters used a knife from the cutlery to turn the AC on and kept it back as it is into the cutlery stand again which is an absolute blunder in terms of health standards.The service was really slow and staff seemed totally lost. We ordered two of their signature cocktails, a margherita and a cosmopolitan. It took them around 15 - 20 minutes to get our drinks( the place was...read more"
335,My first visit and probably my last. Average food and the cocktails aren‚Äôt prepared well. 
336,Worst staff service ever..making 6 people sit on a table for 2..when asked to join 2 tables they said it is against their restaurant policy..what kind of a place is this with such unprofessional behavior
337,Terrible staff. Had a reservation and was denied entry due to 'technical reasons'. They didn't even phone to let us know. Definitely will not be going back.
338,This stunning housetop bar with inconceivable horizon and porch perspectives had been in my bookmarks for at some point now! Cherished their mixed drinks! We had bourbon sharp and exemplary LIIT. For nourishment we had Mexican chicken slider and chicken Chettinad. 10/10 for nourishment. Bestest spot to have nourishment from feel to support. My experience was incredible.
339,"I went here on a Sunday evening for my birthday. The ambience gets a 5/5. You need to come a little early by 8/8:30 to get a good sitting coz it gets full fast. The service is a bit slow and they didn't have all the beers which was disappointing. And the ones they had were also limited. Food is decent. The naan and paneer combo was nice. Pizza was great. The starters were average. All in all it was a good experience if you're fond of rooftops, good sky views, a decent live music experience. "
340,"Everything tried here is just really good from their bow, to chicken Parantha, kebabs platter, French fries. Even their drinks are heavenly. Services is really good. This is a must try place for sure"
341,Amazing place to chill with friends or loved ones ‚ù§Ô∏èHukka service bhaiya was soo amazing and polite (forgot his name unfortunately) but amazing food and ambience and drinks 
342,"Went to this place for drinks and it was a fairly good experience. Tried Baileys and Jagerbomb, which were usual. I was recommended by a friend to try their cocktails, so I tried the whisky sour and some white wine sangria. Both of these were good.Tried some veg kebabs, nachos, and a chicken starter, all of which was the usual. Wasn't impressed, but wasn't disappointed either.The ambience is good. Loved their rooftop seating. The staff is friendly and cooperative.I would probably revisit this place sometime soon."
343,"The service and presentation is great. The indian dishes i tried were so good, ended up ordering 3 of the same amritsari kulcha combo! The pizza was decent, could have been better. I sat in the indoor seating, this could have been made more comfortable, the low tables werent the best. The music was too loud, and crowd even louder. The rooftop seating on the other hand seemed much much better. "
344,Saturday Night. You can enjoy party mode. We managed to find a quieter place in topmost floor. Staff is helpful too. Follow FoodstepsOfficial on instagram.#foodstepsofficialhttps://www.instagram.com/foodstepsofficial
345,"We were asked to change tables thrice, and then wait staff and repairmen kept asking us to step out. Repairs and upkeep should be done before opening the restaurant in the evening. Its all very nice and pretty on the outside but the staff cannot make a single recommendation of food or drinks, they have to be told 5 times for every thing and in general its all very below average"
346,Super place to hangout...drinks and food at its best.Ambience is also good though they have to change few things as every client loves changes.Staff is well trained & very friendly.Keep up the good work.
347,Great ambiance!! The service was excellent .. The MFB salad.. Is a must to try!! And dont forget to try the nachosüëÖ!!!also the red thai curry makes it worth visiting it!!
348,"Another gem in the streets of safdarjung! Antidot's terrace is an amazing place to be on a windy, cool day. The view, the water encatchment round the terrace is just phenomenal. The seating is statistically placed so to give all the tables some privacy and space. The staff is courteous, the food is amazing, especially their pizzas. They don't have a dedicated hukkah menu, however their staff can verbally recite it to you.Overall a good evening date place!"
349,"Let me start from the moment we entered in restaurant. it was too small to occupy group of people. Thank fully we got one seat because of few wonderful people seating over there.. From there my worst experience started. we waited for 5-10 mins that somebody will offer menu or a glass of water which generally happens in no. Of restaurants I went... But unfortunately I was wrong in judging this restaurant... We had to beg for glass of water and requested them thrice.. and then somehow we received water.. then we ordered something to eat and some hard drinks as well... To my surprise, On a crowd of 10 people(exact ) on 2nd floor, they were not competent enough to serve properly on one...read more"
350,This is a decent place to enjoy food and drinks on terrace with a view of aircraft take-offs every minute. They have indoor seating as well but we were lucky enough to get such a view.Wines were unnecessarily expensive as compared to other outlets.We were super hungry & thought of trying 'Nasi Goreng'. As the Nasi Goreng doesn't disappoint nor did this one. A perfect chicken satay preparation topped with half fried egg tasted scrumptious. 
351,Miscalculation.... Calculated extra drinks... Lack of basic service.... Waiters were arrogant.... Even water were served after multiple reminders
352,Very very pathetic management on Saturday night..... There was chaos all over. They didn't let in even those who had appointments...........
353,Service is horrible. Staff is rude and incompetent. Management could not account for the reservations that they received from applications and made people wait and were not even apologetic about it. 
354,"@AntiDot name itself say they are Anti of Any Dot. Such a lovely place to hang out with family and friends. If you like trying fusion or experiment with your alcohol then this place is surely for you. They have different types of beer like - Apple, Watermelon, blueberry, draught beer and many more.Went there for lunch today and really liked the way it was set-up, They have three floors and an open terrace.I was so confused what to order because the menu was so vast, but the Manager did helped and recommended.So I ordered -Chilli Fritto Misto kebabs - These are the mini kebabs stuffed with Cheese, Corns and Chilli bhajisBeer Braised Chicken - It was slow Braised Chicken morsels...read more"
355,Its a beautiful cafe with aesthetics walls. Starting from the food to the vibe to the cafe staff everything is just amazing. Especially the terrace of the cafe is beautiful and also for some reason very refreshing. They are serve flavoured beers and I must say that blueberry and strawberry ones are my favorite. I love the good and dont even get me started with the cheesecake and dimsums. The dimsums were so moist and the cheesecake was so well balanced. 
356,"Just perfect! The Food, service & ambience are amazing. Try crafted coctails, ask for watermelon mocktail (not on menu), & berry cheesecake. Too good. Sit on the rooftop if you want that perfect. "
357,"Its a one-of-a-kind eatery that's impressed the crowds with its beautiful decor and relaxing ambience. This cafe has a botanical theme and a dreamy terrace seating that gives you a spectacular view of the Capital city. Get this -  there is actually water flowing around and through all the tables!one of the most important is reason to be here is the food. The menu covers a range of different cuisines, including Continental, North Indian and Chinese.Also i was so eager to ger some ‚Äúinstaworthy cocktails‚Äù but the one which was ordered was not up to the mark!

358,"Lovely place to visit for a quiet Saturday evening. We took the rooftop on level 3.Drinks-The scotch was standard. For LIITs, we called for the recommended Kala Khatta as well the Classic LIIT. The preparation was not upto to the mark and felt too sweet. (3/5)Food- For apps, we called for Paneer Tikka and Chilli Chicken Dry as well as Corn Kebabs. Food was on neutral side and nothing to excite. (3/5)Service- The service was on slower side. (2/5)Overall- 2.5/5.The place is nicely done and has good potential. Nevertheless, they are not upto the mark."
359,"This amazing rooftop bar with incredible skyline and terrace views had been in my bookmarks for sometime now! So happy to have explored this wonder place. Soulful music, food so good and great customer service experience. When in Delhi, do try this place! It‚Äôs a must! "
360,Service is not at all good...overrated ..ambience is not the same as what is being sold online.food is okay...rooftop seating is not given to couples...
361,Antidot is nice reatro bar that has indoor as well as outdoor seating.Serves variety to cuisines along with amazing drinks.Its you love to have a nice view of city while having your meal this is a place for you.Recommened for parties and dates
362,"I love this place. A lovely bar/cafe with beautiful interiors. The food is delicious üåª and the cocktails, oh my! The presentation & service bowled me over. Love it, will visit again. ü•Ä"
363,"Great ambience on the terrace. Service was courteous but pretty slow. Food tasted really good, especially the Bao ! There were some dishes that we wanted to order that were not available though. Still Recommended for the Baos !"
364,A small amazing place to be at. We chose to sit indoors because of the rains. Loved their cocktails! We had whiskey sour and classic LIIT. For food we had Mexican chicken slider and chicken Chettinad. 10/10 for food.  But the service was extremely slow and a bit neglected too. Good that comes together soon. Would love to visit again soon. 
365,"Unprofessional staff, bad foodDon't visit.We ordered some chicken and all I could taste was some old burnt oil. Totally unprofessional waiters to add to the woes. "
366,"Woah! What a fantastic please to have food. If you still thinking, than stop thinking and visit. Bestest place to have food from ambience to service. My experience was fantastic. This restaurant is on 2ns floor and even have open terrace. But as its hot so we prefer to sit inside. We went there for lunch. They have vast menu. We were quite confused so the manager helped us and recommended us for Chicken chettinad and paneer chettinad. The flavour of chettinad was too Yumm. They serve 2 Malabar paranthas along with that, Which was too crispy. We were full after having these. But my friend want to try their grilled chicken breast. Well! That was too delicious. And they serve veggies along...read more"
367,"Pretty cool place to have a meetup with friends. They are spread over 3 floors, but area on each floor is small. Definitely opt for the rooftop! We had a live music evening, and it was pretty fun.Their cocktails are pretty good, with some really cool stuff. For food they mostly have finger-food options, and the menu is not very expansive. But for what it's worth, the food is good.Overall a nice place to have a good time, without spending a fortune.PS: DO NOT order their ""fire tower"" cocktail. It's just a tower of ""glasses"", with a paltry 100ml cocktail drink. Costs 2000 bucks, and is not worth it at all. If you wanna do it, do it just for the theatrics of the fire."
368,"The ambience ,the staff, the food everything is quite good. Staff is very humble and kind enough. We ordered a pasta,pizza and a beer. All these 3 things tasted good. The first visit at this place was worthy. "
369,"Before I put a review, jus a mention - tat one star is less for the very low lights arnd our table..that's it!! They have an awesome bar tender, none of his cocktails r overpowering, jus the right mix n balance..09/10..do try out his signature cocktails..food here is flavourful n portions r gud for two..staff is courteous..parking available behind the building..but the X factor is their rooftop!! Don't miss it on a monsoon evening..its heavenly!!üòò"
370,"So I visited this place a week ago. Let me tell you in detail how disappointed I was. Service guys are just lost in their dreams. You will literally have to wait half an hour for your drinks to get opened. Highly unprofessional, casual attitude of the staff. Dispenser in washrooms are just for showcase. Take your handwash from home with you, else you might have to eat with those hands. Food is just bland in taste. Prices are so high but when you taste the food you will regret ordering. When I complained their manager about my experience, he told me to wait for 5 minutes, after that he disappeared. So guys make a smart choice and save your hard earned money. I learnt my lesson after...read more"
371,"Antidot was a cafe which was all over on social media because it being a water bar, however when we went there was no water in the channels. It looked like just another cafe. The food was very okay. The staff was very good and polite though. "
372,"The food wasn't impressive at all, not to mention highly overpriced. The drinks were okay, but the variety was far less than the menu and they include VAT + Service charge which frankly is a little unfair. "
373,"My friend and I visited today and we had a horrendous time at this restaurant. We ordered the wontons and the potato wedges and I got sick after eating it. I threw up thrice and it made me so dizzy. I hope you guys check on the freshness of the condiments and the ingredients. And they denied Gold privileges on the signature cocktails, which is unheard of. I have been a patron of the Gold membership and I have never been denied drinks off of the menu. I hope you guys take in this feedback constructively and improve your services. "
374,"Antidot - All About The Terrace....Antidot in Safdurjung Enclave is known primarily for its terrace seating that opens door by sunset. Until then, the two floored restaurant stays dark and with minimal lighting, it could take a while before your eyes are accustomed to the ambience.Once your eyes get used to the ambience you can immerse yourself in the restaurant's music accompanied by its magical cocktails and delicious food. However to make most of the dining experience you have to visit the terrace which has a stunning setup themed around water.Coming to the food, we focused on vegetarian and sea food and were impressed by majority of the dishes served to us.The 'spicy fish bao'...read more"
375,"The ambience was comforting. A good place to hang out with friends. The food was also good. The baked nachos were not upto the mark and not at all worth the money. Other dishes - Chilli paneer and Margherita pizza were good. The drinks that we ordered included Chocolate oreo shake, Virgin Mohito and Orange punch. Okayish drinks with no value for money. "
376,"Amazing experience. Everything was great.. the ambience.. the food.. the drinks.. the hospitality..Vibhu, one of the servers was very polite and helpful in helping us place our order, finding the correct dish which we required, suggesting us good options from the menu and he was very prompt at his service.Overall a very nice night spent at Antidot. Would definitely come there again."
377,Have been to this place twice. Roof top is quiet good but only if the mists are working and the wind is in your favour during summers. The live music is good. Couldn‚Äôt opt for the indoor option as the Ac was barely working in comparison to the heat. Food quality is satisfying and good.

389,"This place is such a great find! Just happened to be there in the neighbourhood when I stumbled upon this gem of a cafe and bar. The decor is amazing, and the place itself is huge. Couldn‚Äôt resist taking a million pictures. The menu is limited but everything tastes good. I loved almost all the staters we had but the highlight of the evening were their beer cocktails and coolers. They are truly out of this world! Especially the watermelon one. Go here for a fun twist on some great food. And to chill in a great ambience. "
390,"Happened to stumble upon this place on a Saturday night, not an ounce of regret. Had a great time. If you love cocktails then this place is a must try. They have some really nice crafted cocktails & the presentation of the cocktails gets a special point. The snacks portions were considerably small specially the Peri Peri Chicken. Pizza was great. All in all I am defi going back for the cocktails. "

Amazing hospitality and their staff are so helpful in making you choose your favorite meal or drink. So we had some of their crafted cocktails and they really did justice to us.

394,"Red Wine Sangria: You know the Sangria is bomb when Jacob‚Äôs Creek is used in preparing it. The right balance of sweetness, bitterness and dryness ‚Äì lo and behold, you have the perfect red wine Sangria. Roasted garlic chicken dimsums: Sometimes, we do crave our dim sum filling to be flavourful and the chefs at Antidot have taken care of this aspect. The lovely smoky taste of roasted garlic in the finely pulverised chicken mince gives a different experience. Not to forget the crystal skin."
395,It‚Äôs an okay place. Kind of congested. The service was really bad and so was the food. The drinks were okay. The cocktails seemed to have been designed which was good aesthetically.

400,Went to their rooftop and the inside bar area. The managers and everyone are pretty rude. The waiting staff is okay but not the best. The food is average.

424,"Went out for a Saturday eve here, the crowd was decent. Not so great. Sheesha was a 6/10. Tried Kala Khatta LIIT, which was an absolute disaster, say a 3/10. Fruit bull on the other hand is pretty decent, I‚Äôd say an 8/10. You could head out for a good weather eve here for their terrace with a bunch of friends, I‚Äôd not suggest this place for a date though. The service was pretty decent, the staff was fairly courteous. "
425,"So this place is amazingly beautiful, and they are one of those few places who actually know how to make good mocktails.In frame: Spicy and Virgin Mary, Mushroom Sliders, and Galauti Kabab rolls. The entire range of food is good and the staff is very courteous, which makes it a perfect date spot."
426,A great lookout for South delhi. This cafe has both indoor and outdoor seating. A comfy place to have your perfect date. Do try mini cheese stuffed kababs.
427,"It‚Äôs like a neighbourhood bar but a very good one at it, reasonably priced, they‚Äôve rooftop which gives a view of residential area which was a slight turn off , really liked the seating üí∫ arrangements, mist sprinkler was a very nice idea üí° in the blazing heat , service was good "
428,"I discovered this gem of a place while browsing through Zomato for a place to enjoy good food and great ambience with friends.The place is situated in Safdarjung, far from the crowded lanes of Hauz Khas but it will give you the same experience. The bar has a water themed decor which gives it a fresh feeling. You can either sit indoors or on the rooftop, from where you get an amazing view.My friends and I ordered a lot of food and everything was perfect. Special mention for their Mac and cheese, do give it a try."
429,So there promotional post on so delhi and decided to visit and they have genuinely done a great job in order to serve there customers . They have a very good style of presenting food to customer which I loved the most. Thumbs up for them.
430,This is a wonderful place with fabulous ambiance. The staff services are quite good. I loved the food. Paneer makhani and kitkat shake stole our heart. A must visit cafe with terrace. Must try.
431,Visit this place with my friends last Wednesday.This place is really cool with the great ambience n their rooftop sitting with good view as well as their lips smacking food n their service is prompt or staff is very attentive.Love to visit this place again.
432,"This Place is best for the dating and having drinks with your partner.Soothing music with well mannered staff. Ambience with all the uniqueness of dishes in menu card to choose from.Give it a try, you will never regret.Cheers guys...Param Rubal Jp "
433,"Visited this place with a group of friends on a Saturday night. The place is spread across 3 floors, one of which is the rooftop where we were seated. The rooftop is well developed, has great seating for larger gatherings as well, Beautiful bar and IPL screening. We ordered- Chicken tikka pizza- was average Mirchi platter- this had 4 kebabs that had a centre of cheese. 2 fried pakoras, some moth and a gravy. The kebabs were absolutely delicious. Chilly chicken- was good Mezze platter- it has pita and hummus and 2 other kinds of dips with wafers. This tasted good as well. Cheese fries- French fries with cheese on them, these tastes a little bland. Nachos- these were fairly good and...read more"
434,Nice place situated with unique waterbar theme..Amazing kababs.. one must try these.. flavours are very nice.. manager n whole staff was really gud while suggesting you food according to ur taste buds.. loved the place 
435,"Went here with my friends for the second or third time, but sadly the quality has degraded a lot in the last 2 months only.You don't really expect this from a newly opened place.Anyhow, the place has totally lost it's charm for me.Would not recommend it ahead."
436,Amazing experience and a big shout out for such aesthetically beautiful drinks. One is happy just by looking at them. Plus the food is also great (and offcourse beautiful). Keep it up
437,"Nice and friendly staff, quick service, huka with live band and chilling atmosphere, nice place to have fun with friends, we enjoyed our friend bachelor party there and its worth "

450,"Where do I begin really???So, four of us were here on a Sunday evening, venturing into a new place with expectations. We decided to sit on the first floor since a dust storm and subsequent rains drenched the outdoor seating area.First impression, too dark. The upholstery was dark green and the lights were very minimal, so much so that it was difficult to even read the menu. They had empty champagne bottle as decoration without even removing the labels, I mean why???For a while, I felt like I might have been in a bar somewhere in a shady place, maybe Paharganj (don't fret, its just an assumption).The music is loud and there was a live artist who seemed to be in his 20s but I think...read more"

The rooftop decor is done really well and you get amazing vibes while at this place. The menu has items to please the taste buds of vegetarians as well as non-vegetarians. Do try their Chicken Tikka, White Sauce Pasta and the wide variety of delectable mocktails.Cheers!"
453,Great terrace- more space after renovation. They have a decent screen on the roof. This cafe is a good choice for a game night with some kebabs and hookah.

The place has got an amazing vibe with some great music being played in the background! The cafe is quite spacious with seating both inside as well as outside! When it comes to drinks we had ordered quite a few like sangria, cosmopolitan, whiskey sour, cold coffee etc. Every drink was excellent and tasted perfect. We also ordered food namely nachos, fish and piri piri chicken supreme. The portion served of chicken and fish was way too less considering the money they are charging for this dish. We felt the food wasn‚Äôt value for money!...read more"
461,"Ambience , food , service everything is on point. Food‚Äôs quality and quantity both are up to the mark. This place serves sheesha‚Äôs too which are smooth and lasts quite long. The rooftop is a place you must visit in the evenings for a great view and crowd."
462,This place is perfect for a romantic evening with your special someone. It has a mini terrace to the main terrace with just 4-5 tables and it‚Äôs perfect for a quite couple time. There was live music which was just amazing and candle lights were cherry on the top. The main terrace is a nice place to hang out with your gang. Menu is pretty common and food is also good. Liquor variety is nice. Staff is extremely sweet. Service was fast. The place is stretched on 3-4 floors so there is no issue of getting a table. I loved the place. Kudos!

We were having a great evening untill.....We had already asked for our bill when a bouncer (Dinesh) came up to our table and asked us if we wanted to order anything else. The tone and tenor was more like 'finish your things and leave'. I would've understood this if we were creating any scene or were loud and disturbing other guests. I was sitting with my wife and another friend and peacefully that too. We were waiting for our bill!Anyway the manager (Mayank) was called and though he was all...read more

481,Good place. Excellent service.. polite staff esp Puneet who was our attach√© for the evening. Food and drinks amazing to add on to the ambience
482,Don‚Äôt go by the reviews or the ratings.The place is extremely average with very average food and straight drinks only.It gives you the option of a rooftop but with music that barely makes staying there bare able.Visit if you have nothing else to choose and have money to waste.

501,Extremely nice. The bill was perfect to what we took. All the best for the future of this place. Punnet was the one who served us and it was really nice of him. Tables were cleared from time to time and things came at the right time after ordering. 
502,"First of all service was very poor, their waiters didn't know a thing about anything about service and the food which is being served. Even though it is a water bar but that water theme is only on their top floor. I went there only to see it but got disappointed when I found out that it's full and i have to sit in that average theme. Food is not so good few things are mediocre but rest is just below average and not taste satisfying."

And a live night for every day and every genre. Even better are the managers and the owners. Personal attention to Every. Single. Customer. Thats unheard of when you‚Äôre regulars at Auro or Summerhouse. Best of all is Nitish. Wish I could date him. "

515,"After seeing all the promos and sponsored ads, I planned for a date at this place.Already booking on zomato, along with double conformation with the staff didn't get me the exact place which I wanted.Also the place which I got did not have a proper light connection.Talking about the staff , they are humble as other cafes.Food was also average and not so awesome .P.s. Quite hype promotion , not fully satisfactory."
516,"We visited on Wednesday night and were highly impressed by the interior, food, service and courtesy of the staff. We tried Veg Pesto Pasta, Fat Indian Plate (Paneer Tikka, Mallei fondue and kadak naan), Mini cheese stuffed kebabs, Cold Coffee and Death by chocolate. Everything on the plate was presented so well and tasted even better. There was live singing. We were so impressed that we didn't even mind paying the mandatory service charge. The menu has more items in the Non-Veg section than Veg which could be improved."

The view at night might be a pretty nice one but in the day time, it is just normal.Coming to the food, we ordered Green Thai Chicken Curry which was really good.

526,"The cafe has a beautiful rooftop seating along with indoor seatings on two floors below.The food is not exactly to die for but you will find it worth the effort. I would recommend 'Fat Indian Plate', Dal Makhani Bowl and kebabs. However the thing that I liked the most was the customer service.They were prompt and attentive and assisted me throughout my evening in a very chivalrous manner. I even had a discrepancy in the bill which I figured out the next day but they solved it over a call in a matter of minutes and took my word for it without any argument or hesitation."

About food I love their Chicken chettinad, Bao‚Äôs , grilled fish, chicken salad & BurgersTheir staff was also quite welcoming and they took good care of us. "
537,With high hopes we went to this place. Entering here the ambience was amazing the view was good but that's it folks. This was the worst experience of my life in a restaurant. We ordered drinks (Simple Whiskey) and the service was so poor it took them 20 minutes just to get the glasses and another 5-10 minutes to get water and coke. For appetisers we ordered grilled fish at first it was okay but when we ordered second round of fish it was cold and with excess salt. We ordered margarita pizza it was fine and ordered Chicken with French fries with caramelised onion the server did not hear and just got caramelised onions we had also ordered grilled veggies bao which came after 45-50 minutes...read more

Alcohol content in the cocktails were meh!Food was okay but again quantity was iffy. They had run out of Huostan Wings, the Peri Peri Chicken was Satay and for the Indian palate, that is too less. For 500, the meat was less than what you would find on a breast piece.Service was slow. I don't know if it was because of Saturday night.They had, I think, run out of inventory, as they practically served our last piece of fish and took it while we were still eating out first serving.On the plus, the ambience was good and the...read more"

543,"The management needs to rework their cocktails, while the presentation is great the ingredients used are definitely sub-standard and all cocktails have a bitter chemical aftertaste.¬†Extremely Deceptive management practices as well on deals."

551,"We went here on valentine's night. Quite honestly, I really liked the place for their delicious food, amazing ambience and live music. But service was way to slow, we had to get up ourselves to call waiters to get something. Drinks came on time but we ordered Just two dishes and after almost 15mins they informed that one of it is not available and another one took forever to come. We thought of cancelling that since it was taking so long, since we were getting late. Trust me guys, if service was good I would have given this 4 above rating because rest of things were great. Staff was very courteous..Hope this improve in future.Also, just a suggestion nothing to do with ratings, We...read more"
552,I had the worst restaurant experience at this place. We booked a table a day before coming to this place. But apparently they did not reserve it for us. We were given 2 chairs to sit next to the bar which was completely dark. We asked the staff several times to make us sit at a better place but they were highly uncooperative. 
553,"So when we heard the name Antidot- waterbar cafe, it was so intriguing that we decided to go and check out. And it was beautiful. Be it the concept, the interiors, the hospitality, the food, the drinks, the music, the ambience, I was beyond satisfied.Some of my favourites that I had here were:Malayi soya chaap- Well marinated, very soft and well flavored. Definitely recommended.Houston chicken wings- Chicken was very juicy and the sauces and spices just made the taste better to another level. A must try!Mini cheese stuffed kebabs- These kebabs looked really green and nice with all the presentation. And it tasted even better.

558,"We visited Antidot on a Sunday night after finding it on one of the leading restaurant app. The restaurant is spread over 3.5 floors. The top 1.5 floors are rooftop and simply amazing. We reached there around 9:15 PM and there was live performance going on. The experience was awesome.And it was made better by courteous staff who were fine with us shifting tables twice, had angheetis to keep diners warm in a bit cold weather of Delhi. They added tables as the diners number got increased on rooftop and they did it professionally despite being new. They serve variety of cuisine along with alcohol and hookah. We tried 3 items and all were well prepared and presented.Need a few...read more"
559,"Antidot waterbar cafe is a beautiful cafe located in Safdarjung. It has a lovely ambience and is located in a good location. This cafe has a lovely rooftop and a very good ambience. The food here is very good and the mocktails as well as the cocktails are really refreshing! The chicken kabab and chilli chicken is a must try for the non-vegetarians. For the vegetarians, amritsari kulcha and the veg kababs are a must!Overall, it's a really good cafe and I'll rate it 5/5 for everything."
560,"With a tremendous increase in the food industry and the enthusiasm of the consumers trying new cuisines and experience something unique out of the culinary delight, Antidot came up with a flabbergasting concept of building the first Waterbar in town. As fancy as it sounds, it looks alluring too. Heading to the rooftop, continuous water flow on the bar desk, sitting with tables with water inside, and even the water flowing on the side wall of each seating is a kind of fancy poison that Antidot has to offer and cure."
561,Visited antidot on a Saturday night ! Great ambience and food. Great service by anbir! Will definitely visit again. Penne arrabiata and bao is a must 
562,"Great place! Best Shisha so far , love the food especially the Chilli garlic fish which just melts in your mouth ... the roof top is the best place to be !! Ps: courteous staff and amazing ambience !"
563,"Recently I went to this place with my friends and I just fell in love with the concept. Do not miss to take the terrace table because that's the best, wherein there is water bar (literally) and the whole boundary of the terrace includes water, which was beautiful. They have two more floors beneath this with amazing interiors and lightings. So yeah, this place was huge and gorgeous.The food and drinks that I had here were again amazing.

565,"Antidot waterbar cafe is an amazing cafe located in the Safdarjung area of New Delhi. It has a lovely and soothing ambience and is certainly one of the best date places in town. The food here is amazing. Non-vegetarians would definitely love the chicken kabab which they're serving of 2 types in a single plate, I tried it and it was literally amazing. For vegetarians, amritsari kulcha is a must which is served with 2 different Indian gravies! The mocktails and the cocktails are also pretty good, the virgin mojito is extremely refreshing with amazing taste and for cocktails, you could try the Classic Martini which is amazing too.

Delhi‚Äôs winter afternoons being pleasant and comfortable we opted for rooftop seating. Staff is efficient and well informed. They helped us in placing order.Cafe style menu, serving multi cuisine dishes. Started with chicken ceasar salad and apple liit. Chicken kebabs; chicken tikka and chapta kebab along with chutney.

So, I recently visited Antidot with a friend and we were amused to see the whole place.

573,"This place is definitely a must visit. The ambience and decor of the place is so beautiful I can spend each and everyday to experience the beauty of the place and relax. The icing on the cake is that the food here is extremely delicious. They have a very different menu and anything you order is finger licking. Things I ordered were mushroom Risotto, chicken chettinad, cream of mushroom soup, mini cheese stuffed kebab, chicken dimsums, oyster chicken wings. Each and everything was better than the other."

575,Great place with a great vibe !! A new go to place .. specially for the couples ( as they called the deck upstairs a special romantic vibe spot lol ) and for all the sheesha lovers. I completely loved the vibe of this place. Lovely staff & hospitality!! Thanks  to jagbir & anveer panwar for a great service üòä
576,This place has just opened 2 months back so the crowd was not up to the mark. It has a beautiful interior with a gentle water bar and attractive ambient lightning. Its a nice cafe for a one time visit. Food was 8/10 and its a bit expensive as compared to the taste of food. The waiters are polite and friendly and the service is really fast. Their terrace is amazing to chill and eat.
577,"Antidot is located right opposite to the Deer Park at Safdarjung Enclave which is apparently Delhi's posh locality which lies amongst the greenery of Deer Park. The area has been built upon three floors including the terrace seating which makes you witness the nature's beauty all around. Plus the decor that they have done is commendable. The service is quick and the taste of each and every food item is exemplary. A special mention to their peri peri chicken supreme which came in skewers and were served with spicy mayo dip. It tasted amazing. Apart from that I had tex mex nachos which had a topping of chicken keema, mayo and salsa sauce. This was another appetizing dish. Mac and cheese...read more"
578,"Antidot as an idea had promise - a good location, decent interiors and the curiosity inducing subtitle of a 'Waterbar'That's where the good stuff ends - they play bizzarely loud, terrible music at all hours (seriously, people probably don't want to dance to Kygo at 5 in the evening) that makes talking or even thinking a herculean task in or around the premises. Also, there's no such thing as a Waterbar, its a lie. Please play music less loud and maybe I'll begin to think about returning."
579,"A romantic lounge with a beautiful landscape outside seating. Antidot Cafe is a 3 level lounge with a fascinatingly lit 2 level indoor seating and a eccentric rooftop seating which has a waterbar. Probably a new thing to know or experience, that a drink can now be served on a marble on water instead of a regular wood stage of the bar.In Food we had,- The MFB.A very tasteful salad with an assortment of lettuce, cherry tomato, salmon and shrimp. The dressing was quite fulfilling and the wholesome healthy feast was very satisfying.- Tex Mex Nachos.With Meet keema infusion, the nachos were really joyous to eat.

582,"Antidot is Delhi's first waterbar cafe with water flowing all across its perimeter and especially at the bar. It has been built across three levels. Inside seatings are warm and cozy. On a winter afternoon, perhaps the terrace seatings are preferable with a green view of the deer park plus the outlet itself that has been decorated so well. The staff is welcoming and suggestive. They helped us choose the best seat to the best dishes and drinks. All the deletable items were served to us within no time. I ordered the following items:DRINKS:BERRY SANGRIA - red wine sangria along with berries made a perfect combo. The presentation and taste was bang on.DEATH BY CHOCOLATE - This cocktail...read more"

587,"Excellent ambience and great food. We ordered a Berry Sangria, a Rose Sangria, Houstoun Wings, and Spiced Wings. The food was great, especially the Houston Wings and Berry Sangria. Our sever Mr. Umesh was very welcoming and polite. "
588,I love places with a Terrace! So after a quick search I found this newly opened place near my house. It was pretty could on the terrace but the view was worth it. I ordered a Hot Chocolate. Though it was soothing but I feel it could  have been a little better in it's rich chocolate taste. Then I ordered Chicken Chettinad and Spiced Prawns. The Chicken Chettinad was served with Malabar  Parantha and it was damn delicious. I can easily say it was one of the finest dishes I have had ever. Even the prawns were good. They had the basic Chicken Tikka dressing and they were crispy and juicy. Happy to have a wholesome meal here.
589,"Antidot is a great place to have a meal. A multi storey restaurant with aquatic theme and a great view. I had Virgin Mojito as my drink and ordered Alfredo Pasta with a Chicken Pizza. The Pasta was super creamy with right amount of flavours, nothing extra. The pizza was thin crust with generous quantity of chicken on it. I liked how they kept their pizzas light yet heavy with toppings. A lucrative meal I had, I must admit."
590,Horrible music! Too loud! No scope to talk and think. They should seriously consider reducing volume to suit the size and acoustics of the place. Plus the cocktails are mediocre
